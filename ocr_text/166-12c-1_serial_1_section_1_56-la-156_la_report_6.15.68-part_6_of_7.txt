Dear Sirs:

At the request of the carrier the above named patient was
examined by mé on August 15, 1967.

The following is an account of ‘an accident which occurred on
September 25, 1966 at 8 fs M.

"The morning .of*the said date I was breezing a filly. In other
words, I was asking her to run as far as she could, I was
riding the horse. Jt was a very foggy morning that day. A
few seconds aftex I had started the filly I-was down, She
threw me, I don't know how I fell, when, everything went
blank, The people who were watching me couldn't see what
happened due to the fog. J was taken by zslance to the
hospital, Corona Community Hospitel. I was treated by Dr.
Richard elson. He had applied some stitches to what he
claimed was excessive bleeding. He applied about three to
the lower side of my chin, and I don't know how many in the
left eye, They took a series of x-rays, and at that time

LI was not fully conscious. I started to come to, when I felt
the coldness of the platform or table they had put me on, ,
I realized something was wrong with my eyes at the moment I
started to come to. .When he started to insert the stitching

TESS cont'd:

needle in my eye and I move or less was much against that,’
I didn't like the stitch to be put there, He insisted that

‘it was necessary. I didn! t know the gravity of the wound,

but J thought it wasn't necessary to be stitched, I couldn't

“see myself, and he just told me it was necessary o- He wanted
.to keep me in the hospital for a week, but I didn't like the’

idea, I did stay overnight."

As the history will indicate, the patient rambled a bit.

‘I asked the patient what he knew about sand being in his eyes

after the accident and this was his reply.

Vv
"Dr. Nelson when he put the stitches in my.eye I couldn't
open the eye to see anybody due to the sand in my eye. I.
had to tell Dr, Nelson to remave the sand, but he told one
of the nurses afterwards and she took care of that."

With regard to the subsequent treatment received, the patient
was a little vague. Having reviewed the medical file, it was
apparent that the patiént had been treated for a short period
of time and discharged by Dr. Nelson, and he then returned
to Dr. Nelson with complaints, and the latter referred him to
an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr, Paul Nilsson.

When I asked the patient about this point, this is what he said.

. “rhey were trying to arrange that date, - appointment date,

between Dr. Nelson and Dr. Nilsson, then we had to o.k. that
through the office which took about two weeks or 50. It was
amatter of trying to get an agreement. Dr. Nelson apparently
considered me discharged because when I went down to see him

again he instructed his secretary to contact the company to

reopen the account, and he did not act or treat me after that
until he received the o.k. from the company."

‘The patient. further stated:

“as far as treatment, I was under his care three or four :
visits, About a month later ‘he said I should sce Dr. Kiehn,
because I told him I had moved froin Corona and back to my
original, address. : a : . ns

First of all he (Dr. Kiehn) asked if there were any broken
“bones in this region, I told him I did not know. He ordered
“x-rays taken. He gave me a small tube of some lubricant and
“that was a sample type, and I used it, and it ran out within’

a:week, It didn't seem to help much, He didn't say anything
~ at all." So

I also asked the patient about the recommendation of Dr.
Kiehn that he be sean by a neurosurgeon named Dr. Robert
Fiskin, The patient summar vised this situation in the following’
way: : ,
a very abortive attempt by Dr. Kiehn. I waited
hs after Dr. Kiehn told me, It hasn't come, I

“never saw the neurosurgeon, -I never received the notice from

the insurance company.. He (Dr. Kiehn) hasn't discharged me,
he said until I see the neurosurgeon, and as yet. I have not
seen hin, so how can I go back to him, : :

‘The report of Dr. Kieha is in general negative, however, |.

might require surgery. Se :

EXAMINATION cont'd:
~ Visual Field Screening cont'd:

* The examination was then repeated at the
tangent screen using both the 4/1000 and
2/1000 white targets. This demonstrated
marked constriction of both visual fields,
‘but more so in the left eye than in the
right. It should be noted that the amount of
constriction with the two different targets
_was not proportional to the size of the target
used, The examination was then concluded using
' the standard perimeter. This test showed moderate ~
constriction of the right field and marked con-
striction of the left field. When the various
fields are compared, it is obvious that the results
are highly inconsistent and in no way could be
related to any organic process involving either
the eyes or the intra-cranial visual pathways.

_Stereopsis: Patient has normal binocular function.

. Essentially normal eye examination,

Based on my examination, the history obtained, and the medical
‘records presently evailable, I do not believe that this patient
sustained any permanent disability as a result of tha accideat
of September 25, 1946, : ae oe :

The injury to the left upper eyelid’ referred to in other
medical examination is not demonstrable at the present time,
and I strongly advise against any attempt to resort to surgical
intervention, ‘This patient, in my opinion, has the right
combination of factors to warrant extreme conservatism in
utilizing any therapy of this nature. Namely he has symptoms

251


--- Page 7 ---
Page 7
Sirhan
8/18/67

which are not organic in origin, and in addition has no
proof whatsoever that any foreign material is retained in
the left orbital area, ;

With regards to the symptoms alleged by this patient, there
is nothing whatsoever in the patient's examination to sub-
stantiate a claim of an organic injury. As noted above,
nearly all the subjective tests of visual function have
clearly demonstrated a pattern of inconsistency which negates
the possibility of any injury to the eyes or the Antra- cranial,
_ visual pathways. o

CONCLUSIONS
As a result of the above reported injury this patient did not
sustain a permanent disability involving his eyes. No further
-medical treatment is indicated as the patient's condition is_
not industrially related. ’

I wish to thank you for this referral; should there be any ;
_ unanswered questions regarding this case, please do not hesitate
to call on me 7 ,

Gentlemen:

The above was exaniined at this office on December 18,
1967. The findings are as follows: He is a male,
single, age 23. His occupation is that of exercise
boy. me , , :

HISTORY: . The patient relates that on
September 25, 1966, while
exercising a horse, he was thrown from the horse.
‘He fell and sustained injuries, He was taken to
the Corona Commuriity Hospital, He had.a laceration
of the left eyelid, a laceration of the chin, con-
tusion of the spine and of the left hand. The laceration
were sutured. He states that at the time of the fall
he was briefly unconscious, He was under the care
of Doctor Nelson. He,was discharged the next day
_ and remained under further care by Doctor Nelson
and hewas stfhsequently referred to Doctor Miller
and then to Doctor Kiehn. He states he still is
under the care of Doctor Kiehn with treatments to
the left eye, he is given some eyedrops, During
this time he states he was seen by. several specialists.
He was temporary disabled for work for. a period
of about two weeks, he thenreturned to work for
the same employer but "not on my full capacity, o
I was not exercising the horsesn, I just worked). - : ,
as general helper and stable boy. In December, OF
1966, I was terminated because of my limitations
which were due to the injury which I received working
at that place!’ I tried to find other work but I
still had handicaps with my eye and low back and
as soon as I mentioned these handicaps I would not
get a job, I did not go on Unemployment because I

258


--- Page 12 ---
’ Re: Sirhan Sirhan -2- December 20,1967

didn't know if I was covered by Unemployment... I
returned to work only about three weeks ago when I
found a job as grocery clerk, in a small store, the
work is light and I'm still doing this work".

COMPLAINTS ¢ . ‘The patient states that he

, ’ still has omsiderable discomfort
in the spine, particularly in the low back but

some discomfort also along the upper spine, He
states that this discomfort occurs whenever he
moves, bends, stoops or stands for a long time.

’ He does not know if the discomfort is increased

by coughing or sneezing because he states he never
coughs or.sneezes, Discomfort is greater in the
morning but at times or in cold weather also at
night. He has no radiated symptoms to the lower
extremities. He complains about the left eye where
he states that the skin on the inner-side of the
-eye is tight and uncomfortable, especially in colder
weather, He states that this "throws my face of
balance", He indicates that the scar on thechin
region is indurated and gives him a feeling of
pressure, He states that at this time he has no

- . impairment of vision,

- PAST HITORY: “With above employer for about

. Six months, He states that never
in the past did he have any industrial claim, signi-
ficant injury, surgery or significant sickness,

EXAMINATION: "Age 23, height 5'4", weight 115
occupation exercise boy.

On examination of the skull, the patient has no

points of tenderness, there are no scars, no signs |

of residuals of injury.

Eyes: Only with his assistance, can a very minimal
scar be noticed on-the medial end of the left upper
eyelid, There is no indication that this scar be
painful or tender, it is cosmetically not noticeable,
Motions of his eyelid are not affected, The left
pupil is dilated by eyedrops’ wnich the patient states
were applied this morning to his eye by Doctor Kiehn.

Face.and chin: With the patient! s assistance, a scar

can be noticed on the under side of his right chin,

.

257



--- Page 13 ---
Re: “Sirhan Sirhan : -3- December 20, 1967

The.cosmetic bearing is obviously nil and the area is
minimally indurated, There are no reactions of pain
ox tenderness, no suggestion of regional disability
from this scar, ,

Upper extremities: He states that he had a contusion
to the left hand but he states’ that symptoms have sub~
sided entirely. On regional. examination, there are no
painful reactions, no limitations of motions, no signs
of.after effects of injury. Evidence of significant
nailbiting is noticed, . : .

Spine, pelvis and lower extremities: The patient's gait
is normal, he wears no support, he walks on his toes
and heels and he squats without any difficulty. His
feet are flat, There is increased swayback of postural
nature, There is no spasm at any time during examination,
' no deformities, no visible scars, He states that dis- -
comfort is at the lumbosacral level, there are no
points of tenderness and there is absence of points
of trigger pain, Reflexes are all normal, there are
no sensory changes, gixths are normal and leg tests
are entirely negative. Minimal limitation off anterior
flexion is displayed by the patient but on sitting
flexion test his range is greater than average.

Measurements and tests:

Re; Sirhan Sirhan whe December 20, 1967

X-RAYS: “Submitted films: These are X-rays

: from the Good Samaritan Hospital
and are films of the skull and of the lumbar spine,
The findings are entirely normal and negative, .There
are no signs of recent or. old bony injuries, no
abnormalities of the disc spaces, no significant
arthritic changes, There is postural swayback.

SUBMETTED FILES: These are records of Doctor Nelson,
Doctor Kiehn, Doctor Tashma,

Doctor Patterson, Doctor Johnson,’ Doctor Nugent and

Doctor Yamshon, The records refer to the patient's

--complaints. and injuries incident to the accident of

September 25, 1966. Examination by several éye

--specialists is negative for any Signs of an injury

to the left eye or for any signs of disability
attributable to the minor scar near -the left eye,
Examination by neurosurgeons is reported to be
negative with réference to neurosurgical findings.
A report by Doctor Yamshon refers to subjective
factors of permanent disability involving the low™
‘back and to scarring and disfigurement incident to
the scars, I thoroughly disagree with these con-

‘ elusions,

CONCLUSION: With reference to the scars and
to the patient’ s low back, it is
“my ‘opinion that this patient's subjective complaints
are entirely unsupported by regional evaluation of
the findings. Without his assistance, I would not.
have noticed the scars and their cosmetic defect
is, therefofe, nil. I also do not belive that
these scars account for any subjective discomfort

. Of pain or tenderness, There was an apparent minor

injury to the left hand fromwhich the patient has
subjectively and objectively recovered, He claims ~
persistent symptoms involving the low back where
regional examination is not supporting, even to a
minimal extent, these complaints. TI conclude that
in my opinion he has fully recovered, from a sub-
jective and objective point of view, from the above
injuries with objective residuals consisting ofonly
of minor scars which do not account for any disability
or cosmetic defect, Based on the submitted records
there was temporary disability for about two weeks

‘about two weeks later, he resumed his previous regular

If there are any disabilities involving the left
eye, these will be reported by eye specialists,

With reference tothe other areas, I feel that
recovery has been complete without any after effects,

Mr. Sirhan came to this office on February 21, 1967, having been

The patient exercised ‘the horses at the Granja Vista Del Rio ranch

_ injuries around the left eye. He thinks he was unconscious for a brief
'time. He was seen at the Corona hospital by a Dr. Richard Nelson and the
wounds around the eye ware sutured. In addition to the wound around the
eye he had a wound under the chin, This was also sutured. Four days
later the sutures wore removed, He suffered a brief injury again a few
days after the initial injury and the’ wound edges separated a little bit.
He was unaware of any eye problems until he began exercising the horses
“again. . He noticed at this time that he had to move his head from left to
right in order to see well on either side, This loss of side vision has
definitely improved but he still has some difficulty. This is especially
noticeable in the left eye. “Because of his eye complaints fe was referred
to a Dr, Nelson of Corona and following this to Dir. Miltor Miller of
Ontario, I do not have Dr. Miller's reports so I am unaware of exactly
what his rings were. at the present time Mr. Sirhan's complaints .
primarily are as follows . soe

“He notices that he has some twitching of the eyelid when he looks
to the left, This involves the left eyelid primarily. He also has the’
same type of twitching when he wrinkles his forehead or makes faclal
movements, He has had no sudsequant unconscious attacks, no dizziness,
no weakness of either arms, hands, legs or feet. He complains of a
persistent pain in the superior nasal aspect of the left orbit. My
examination was as follows: . .

His vision was found to be 20/29 in either eye uncorrected, He had no
Significant refractive error, Extraocular muscles were found to be intact,

the pupils were round, were regular, and reacted woll to light and

accomodation, The patient's eyes ware dilated and an examination of the

fundus was performed. No significant abnormalities were found,
Examination was performed’ both with the direct and indirect ophthal-
fe]

moscope, Slit lamp examination showed no flare or cells in either eye,

Both lenses are clear and the media appeared clear., Visual field

examination’ indicates a full field with a moderate amount of general
constriction in the left field. This constriction is inconstant, The
patient's wounds are well healed, however there is a persistent.tenderness
over the superior orbital ridge medially and there is a small amount. of
fullness-‘in this area remaining. The tenderness is medial to the supra-
orbital notch and {s apparently aggravated when the patient looks both to
the left and upward to the left. There is a fibrotic band extending from
this general area dowiward to the area just below the lower canthal
ligament. He claims that this makes him have a rather tight sensation
when he looks to the left. I could demonstrate no abnormal diplopia, .

in fact my Findings are remarkably negative with the exception of the
tenderness and the subcutaneous band which I mentioned, At the present

‘time, I do not feel like operating on the area which is described, and

releasing this band. I feel that we should wait for a period of about

one month yet. At the time of releasing this subcutaneous band I believe
it would be advisable to investigate the original wound area for the
possibility of a foreign body reaction giving him the persistent pain
which he feels and is described above, X-Rays ordered by me have indicated
no evidence of a foreign body, no evidence of any fractures in and about
the orbit, and said X~Rays are essentially negative, The X-Rays were taken
by Dr. Robert Freeman, of this address, I shall see Mr. Sirhan again ;
and repeat visual field tests to make suve that there is no recurrent
abnormality. * Inasmuch as he was unconscious and had not been seen by a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon I believe it would be advisable to have _
age to the brain that might-
have occured at the time of this injury. I have usually referred my
patients to a Dr. Robert Fiskin, of 960 E. Green St., Pasadena, He is a
well-qualified neurosurgeon and if you have no objection I vould ~

.respectfully request your referral of Mr. Sirhan to Dr. Fiskin for such an
evaluation, © ; .

JT trust this will give you an up-to-date accounting of Mr. Sirhan's

_problens.

Sincerely,

jeanne

MARTIN ALBORI, M.D. (Orthopedic), 739 North Highland
Avenue, Hollywood, California was advised of the identity of th-
interviewing Agent and that he was be.ing interviewed concerning
his knowledge of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, 696 East Howard Street,
Pasadena, California.

Dr. ALBORI advised that SIRHAN wes referred to him
by th: Argonaut Insurance Compeny, Los Angeles, California,
for a work related accident, which occurred on or about
September 24, 1966 at the Granja Vista Del Rio - Altfillisch
Construction Company, Corona, California.

Dr. ALBORI advised that SIRHAN complained of
considerable discomfort of the spine and lower back whenever
he moved or bent over, or stood for a long time. The
discomfort was greater in the morning, at night and during
cold weather. He complained that the inner skin of his left
eye tightens and was uncomfortable, especially in cold weather.
SIRHAN stated that he felt that the "scar was pulling his
face off balance".

SIRHAN related to Dr. ALBORI that he missed two
weeks of work after the accident and upon returning to work
he was assigned to tasks of less responsibility, due to his
work related accident. He stated that his employment was
later terminated as a result of the above injury, in that he
could not perform his job satisfactorily.

SIRHAN stated to Dr. ALBORI that he attempted to
find other work, but his eye and back injuries have handicapped
him and he was unable to get a job until about three weeks
before this visit, when he obtained a job as a grocery clerk.

Dr. ALBORI stated that his examination reflected
no physical defect as a result of the injury, although
SIRHAN did have insignificant scare over his left eye near his
nose and on his chin. These scars could not be observed
without SIRHAN's pointing them out.

ALBERT TASHMA, M.D., (Ophthalmologist), 6753
Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, was advised
of the identity of the interviewing Agent and that he was
being interviewed concerning his knowledge of SIRHAN SIRHAN.

SIRHAN was referred tos Dr. TASHMA by the Argonaut
Insurance Company, 1001 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California, for a workwrelated idury sustained by SIRHAN
on or about September 24, 1966, while employed by the
Granja Vista Del Rio Ranch - Altfillisch Construction Company,
Corona, California.

SIRHAN complained of facial discomfort, inability
of his eye to rotate, inability to shift his gaze back and
forth and poor side vision.

Dr. TASHMA's examination reflected no organic
symptons and no permanent disability as a result of the
accident. He stated that, in his opinion, SIRHAN had the
right combination of factors to warrant extreme conservatism
in utilizing any therapy of a surgical nature. Nearly all
the subjective tests of visual function have clearly
demonstrated a pattern of inconsistency which negates the
possibility of any injury to the eyes or the intra-cranial
visual pathways. No further medical treatment was indicated
as the patient's condition was not industrially related.

Dr. TASHMA advised that he was unaware of any
political beliefs of SIRHAN and he described SIRHAN as
obnoxious.

to her by an individual using the name and having the
identification of SIRHAN SIRHAN She explained that
according to the information on the face of the check that
the check was for an insurance claim. It is the policy and
normal operational procedure for the bank branch that
receives a check of this nature to forward it to the main
office for payment authorization prior to payment. She gaid
she explained this procedure to SIRHAN, and he seemed "put
out" that there would be a delay in payment. Mrs. BROWN
said that she requested that SIRHAN endorse the reverse
side of the above described check. She said she observed
him sign his name and address on the check. She then
requested that he exhibit some form of identification. He
displayed a California drivers iicense, and she wrote the
initials "CDL" and the number "M238847" directly below
SIRHAN's endorsement. Mrs. BROWN said the number she wrote
down was the number of the drivers license that SIRHAN
exhibited to her.

side of the previously described check would be the date that
she received the check from SIRHAN.

She said after receiving this check she forwarded
it to the Crocker-Citizens National Bank, 1 Montgomery Street,

was received from that bank to pay $1,705 00 to SIRHAN. He

Mrs. BROWN exhibited the original of a Crocker-
Citizens National Bank Cashiers Check, Number 174 775,
dated April 12, 1968, paid to the order of SIRHAN SIRHAN.

license Mrs. BROWN said she wrote the initials "CDL"

over to the Chief Teller, and she would cash the check. She
identified the Chief Teller as PATRICIA MC KENNA. She said
that the date that appears on the check, April 12, 1968,
would be the date that SIRHAN casned it.

Mrs. BROWN said that inquiry had been made at her
bank coneerning the check issued by the Argonaut Insurance
Company. This inquiry was made either on June 6 or 7, 1968,
by persons connected with the insurance company. It was at
that time that she and other persons at the bank learned
that the individual who killed Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY,
and the person who received payment for the previously
described checks were the same.

Mrs. PATRICIA A. MC KENNA, Chief Tellier,
Crocker-Citizens National Bank, 80 Louth Lake, advised
she has been a bank employee for about six years and has
oecupied the position of Chief Teller for about one year
and two months.

She examined Cashiers Check Number 174775, drawn
on the Crocker-Citizens National Bank, dated April 12,
1953, and paid to the order of SIRHAN SIRHAN. She said
that one of her many duties consists of cashing Cashiers
Check previously okayed by bank officials and presented
for payment by customers. She said the above described
Cashiers Check was brought back to her attention during the
latter part. of the week of June 3-7, 1968, by co-employees.
She explained that she and her co-employees discussed the
fact that the name of the individual that appeare on the
Cashiers Check and the person who was arrested by the
Los Angeles Police Department for the murder of Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY were one and the same.

Mrs. MC- KENNA said she recalls making payment
in the amount of $1,705.00 to an individual who had the
name SIRHAN SIRHAN. She said she could not recall the
exact denomination of bills she gave to SIRHAN, but to the
best of her recollection, she gave him $1,500.00 in $20.00
bills, a couple of $100.00 bills, and one $5.00 bill. She
said she wag out of $100.00 bills that particular date, as
a large payment had been made by her on the previous day,
and she recalls the customer received all of her $100.00 bills.
She checked her cagh sheet for April 12, 1968, and verified
that she did not have many $100.00 bills in her cash box
on that date. She recalled the $100.00 bills that she did
give to STRHAN were used and worn. They were not new or
crisp.
