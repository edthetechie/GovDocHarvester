Mr, LOUIS G. SHELBY, 2054 North Berendo, Los Angeles,
California, owner operator, The Fez, mideast restaurant, 1508
North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, advised that he
is familiar with SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

Mr. SHELBY was exhibited a photograph of SIRHAN
SIRHAN by SA PAUL CHAMBERLAIN, JR. and he immediately identi-
fied the photograph.

Mr. SHELBY stated that the clientele at his restaurant
is composed of 70 per cent non-Arabian individuals and 30 per
cent of individuals of Arabian background. Mr. SHELBY stated
further that another floor of his establishment which is
directed more towards drinking and entertainment is composed
predominately of Arabian and other foreign nationality students.

Mr. SHELBY disclosed that his initial contact with
the SIRHAN family came through his connection with a former
employee, ADEL SIRHAN. He stated that his records reveal that
ADEL SIRHAN was employed by him as a musician, periodically
from January 1, 1962 through June, 1967. He stated that the
employment was not constant in that musicians and patrons re-
quire a periodic change and therefore ADEL SIRHAN would occagion-
ally leave nis employment for an undetermined amount of time.

SHELBY disclosed that ADEL SIRHAN, as a musician,
would necessarily work night hours at his club. He stated
that to the best of his knowledge SIRHAN after travelling to
The Fez by car would usually park his vehicle on North Vermont
Avenue or in a nearby adjacent lot.

Mr. SHELBY stated that ADEL SIRHAN could best be
described as an extremely practical pragmatist, who was positive -
ly not connected with any communistic causes. SHELBY stated
that ne felt certain that ADEL SIRHAN was in no way connected
with the W. E. B. Du Bois Clubs of America (DCA) which he under-
stood held meetings in a hall located several buildings away
from The Fez restaurant. SHELBY continued that he knew of no
other member of the SIRHAN family that was connected with the

SHELBY disclosed that ADEL SIRHAN terminated his
employment at The Fez in June of 1967 due to personal reasons
involving his, SIRHAN's, feeling that he would be looked down
upon for marrying a girl who was a dancer. SHELBY stated that
ADEL SIRHAN was at that time going with a MYLENE KAY, an
exotic dancer at The Fez.

My. SHELBY stated that although ADEL SIRHAN would
talk with the other musicians and employees of The Fez, he could
best be described as extremely close, mouthed and SHELBY re-
vealed further that he felt that he, SHELBY, was the only in-
dividual at The Fez who was anyway close to ADEL SIRHAN.”

SHELBY stated that at one time ADEL SIRHAN was going
with another girl who danced at The Fez, named BARBARA KHOURY,
who terminated her employment some two or three weeks ago.

SHELBY stated that he understands that ADEL SIRHAN is
not currently employed and was most recently employed at "Shakers"
in Hollywood, California.

Mr. SHELBY disclosed that he met SIRHAN BISHARA STRHAN
on approximately two or three occasions. SHELBY was again ex-
hibited a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN which he positively
identified as being identical to the brother of ADEL SIRHAN.

SHELBY disclosed that SIRHAN SIRHAN came to The Fez
on approximately one or two occasions and at no time created
an incident there. :

SHELBY stated that his only real in depth conversation
with SIRHAN SIRHAN occurred during Easter 1968 when,as is the
mideast custom, SHELBY and his family were travelling to the homes
of family friends. He stated that he and SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
engaged in a lengthy political discussion at the SIRHAN family
home in Pasadena, California. SHELBY disclosed that STRHAN
SIRHAN was interested in his opinions since he, SHELBY, grad-
uated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
with a Political Science degree and did a year and one-half of
graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley,
specializing’ in the’ International Relations field pri+' °° -
marily in middle east politics.

SHELBY stated that he and SIRHAN SIRHAN discussed the
problems of youth in America, the hippie movement and civil
disobedience. SHELBY stated that SIRHAN was definitely un-
happy with "the establishment” and was extremely politically
oriented with his primary concern being in connection with the
Israeli Arab problem.

SHELBY continued that SIRHAN was concerned about
America and the direction it was taking,as governed by its
foreign policy. SHELBY stated that SIRHAN talked to him of
how the American foreign policy affected Americans as individuals
and advised SHELBY that he felt conclusively that the American
foreign policy was responsible for the establishment of the
State of Israel.

SHELBY advised that the word 'frustrated"would best
describe SIRHAN SIRHAN in that he, SIRHAN, expressed the feeling
that Arabs as well as nations were powerless to ddoanything about
the worldwide Zionist plot. SHELBY advised that he could des-
cribe SIRHAN SIRHAN as confused idealistic and somewhat “left
wing" in his political philosophies.

SHELBY advised additionally that SIRHAN believed that
the worldwide Zionist plot was not being stopped by United
States foreign policy but almost aided

SHELBY stated that he was also friendly with another
member of the SIRHAN family, SHARIF SIRHAN, who, for the last
several months, has visited The Fez once or twice a week.
SHELBY stated that he initially met SHARIF as well as SIRHAN
SIRHAN at the SIRHAN residence in Pasadena when he travelled
there on one or two occasions to rehearse the acts to be shown
at The Fez.

W, E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to sétcialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young secialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself.

A second source has advised that the founding con-
vention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21,
1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at
which time the name W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America (DCA) was
adopted. Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United
States attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that
Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro
communities the Party still supported the plan to build “left”
socialist centers and to solidify the Party base through the
DCA. This source also advised in September, 1966, that Daniel
Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party
believes the DCA should have a working-class outiock and be a mass
organization favorable to socialism, socialist countries and
Marxism, and in April, 1967, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General
secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on
develceping mass. resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at the
Thied National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New York,
from September 8-10, 1967.

Miss ELSA MARIE BUTLER, 1673 North Golden Gate
Avenue, Los Angeles, California, advised that she has been
employed as a belly dancer for the last 11 months at The
Fez, 1508 North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California.

She stated that this is a restaurant which caters to
many persons of Arabian descent. It is owned by LOUIS SHALEBY
who is also known as LOUIS SHELBY. SHALEBY resides on North
Berendo Street, Los Angeles, and has telephone number NO 3-2649.
She said that many of the employees and customers have been
vociferous in their animosity toward Israel. She noted that
Mr. SHALEBY has never expressed any such animosity.

Miss BUTLER has learned that a number of employees
and belly dancers have been questioned. concerning their
associates as a result of the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY. One of the girls so questioned was PHyLLIS
YOUNG who is also known as PENNY and is of Jewish descent.

On the night of June 4, 1968, Miss BUTLER came to
work at 8:00 p.m. At about 1:00 a.m., June 5, 1968, customers
entering the restaurant mentioned that Senator KENNEDY had been
shot. There is no television or radio in this restaurant and
all information obtained was furnished by customers. When
Miss BUTLER verified the fact that a shooting had taken place;
she became very despondent and terminated her act. At about
the same time, she observed the manager of the restaurant who
appeared to be very elated about the news. ‘

The manager is MACHMOUD SIAM who is also known as
MIKE. She said that he was clapping his hands and encouraging
singing in Arabic. She could not understand the meaning, but
noted that the song ended with the Arabic worj, "Yehudi" which
means, "Jewish". In addition, SIAM stated in English that he
was glad that the shooting had occurred and made a statement
that he believed the Jewish people had done this. —

Miss BUTLER described SIAM as about 30 years of
age, good looking, medium complexion, five feet eight inches
in height and has eyes which are almost blue. His hair is
curly and medium length, and he speaks with a heavy accent.
She believes he immigrated to the United States at least five
years ago. He resides in an apartment in Hollywood with a
younger brother. She believes he was previously married to a
school teacher and is either divorced or separated.

She noted that there was quite a bit of discussion
among the employees concerning the shooting and that they
were all furnishing their beliefs as to the reasons. The
bartender, SAM YASIR (phonetic) expressed the belief that the
shooting had been perpetrated by the Catholics.

Miss BUTLER said that although a number of Jordanians
have frequented this restaurant she has never known SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN to be a customer. She said that SIRHAN's brother,
ADEL had previously worked at The Fez as an oud player. She
stated the oud is a musical instrument similar to a lute and is
used to accompany the belly dancers. ADEL left this employment
in July, 1967.

Another brother, SHARIF, is a regular customer at The
Fez.

She noted that ADEL SIRHAN formerly dated a dancer
named MYLENE KAY (phonetic). Miss KAY is an Australian who
possibly knows the entire family and who is believed to be
currently employed at the Barefoot Bar, Vacation Village,
Mission Bay, San Diego.

Miss BUTLER stated that The Fez is usually closed
on Mondays only. She stated that The Fez has not reopened
since the night of the assassination of Senator KENNEDY.
Mr. SHALEBY told her that it was not necessary to report for
work until Tuesday, June 11, 1968. He said that he was closing
the restaurant temporarily because of the animosity expressed
among the customers and employees and he said that it was
unsafe to remain open. She stated that SHALEBY is of Eastern
Orthodox religion and appeared to be ashamed and upset about
the assassination.

Miss BUTLER noted that because of the intense

the atmosphere of The Fez has been most conducive to fights.
She stated that under the current conditions she does not feel that
she could return to The Fez. She expressed her sentiments
to Mr. SHALEBY at which time he implied that MACHMOUD SIAM
would not be returning to his employment.

Miss BUTLER stated that she felt the authorities
should be aware of the atmosphere among the employees and
the customers of The Fez. She could furnish no further
information concerning SIRHAN or his family but expressed
a willingness to assist in any way possible noting that she
is acquainted with most individuals employed as musicians and
dancers in the Arabic community.

Los Angeles, California, was contacted at his place of business
and voluntarily advised as follows:

He has known ADEL SIRHAN and SHARIF SIRHAN for
approximately five years from his frecuenting the Fez Restaurant,
1508 North Vermont Avenue, Log Angeles. ADSL played a guitar
at the Fez, and SHARIF would occasionally visit the Fez with ADEL.

limited to meetings at the Fez and he never saw either of them
away from the Fez. He considered ADEL and SHARIF as acquaintances
but did not consider them ag close friends. He has never engaged
in any political or world affairs discussions with either of them.

HARB advised that when he heard Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY had been shot by a SIRHAN, he wondered if it could have
been ADEL or SHARIF, because of the similarity of the last name.
He discussed this matter at his place of business and it is
possible someone believed he was a close friend of the SIRHANs.
When he later saw a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN on television
and in the newspaper, he immediately knew the alleged killer
was not ADEL or SHARIF SIRHAN. He stated he did not know ADEL
and SHARIF had another brother, as they had never discussed
having another brother and he never heard them mentioned SIRHAN
SIRHAN.

HARB stated he has not seen ADEL or SHARIF for about
three months, as HARB has not visited the Fez for about three
months.

and then returned to Jordan. He believes the father was
not in favor of coming to this country to begin with and
aid not like it here.

very good English, which he considered surprising. SIRHAN
SIRHAN was about 12 or 13 years old. He stated that SIRHAN
STRHAN had a brother named MUNIR, who had a nickname of
"Manure;" another brother who was an assistant to a carpenter;
and a sister who was about fifteen at the time. He advised

station he operated and visit with him. He stated that SIRHAN
had no bitterness at all towards anyone or anything. SIRHAN
SIRHAN was interested in becoming a mineralogist or a geologist.
SIRHAN SIRHAN was always by himself; was not interested in .
politics; expressed no discontent with this country; and was
‘just happy to be here” in this country.

parking lot. SIRHAN attended the John Muir High School in
Pasadena. He stated that after the SIRHANs moved to Lexington

SIRHAN's sister, name unknown, married a wealthy candy
man in Palm Springs, California. Although she lived with him,
the man did not recognize her as his wife. The sister became
sick with leukemia, and came home to die. The girl told her
mother that the husband promised to send the family $250.00
per month for life. The man actually paid the girl's funeral
expenses and sent the family a couple of payments of $250.00.
He believes it highly possible that the family held a grudge
against the girl's husband because of the way he treated her.
STRHAN may have been influenced by this. He could furnish no

On June 11, 1968, Mr. RALPH W. HORNBECK, Assistant
Superintendent for Instruction, Pasadena Unified School District,
stated he was the principal at Longfellow Elementary School,

1065 East Washington Street, Pasadena, in 1952 and 1959.

He recalled at this time, SIRHAN SIRHAN was in the
Seventh or eighth grade at Marshall Jr. High School in Pasadena,
and his brother, MUNIR SIRHAN, was a student at Longfellow School.
Mr. HORNBECK recalled SIRHAN transferred from Marshall to Eliot
Jv. High School later on because his family had moved. MUNIR
would get into trouble from time to time, mainly for fighting
with other students who teased him about his name, and the
fact that he was foreign. At this time, Mrs. MARY SIRHAN
spoke very little English, according to SIRHAN, who took it
upon himself to visit Mr. HORNBECK on several occasions to discuss
his brother. He stated SIRHAN continually emphasized the honor
of his family and stated it was important to preserve this, which
he felt MUNIR was threatening by his actions. Mr. HORNBECK
recalled STRHAN as very intense and said SIRHAN would visit
him from time to time without any particular incident having
occurred in which MUNTR” was involved. Mr. HORNBECK could
not recall whether SIRHAN visited him during more than one
school year, but stated ne had never seen SITRHAN after MUNIR
left the school in which he was the principal.

Mr. HORNBECK did not recall ever talking to Mrs.
SIRHAN and said if he did, it was very briefly.

Mr. HORNBECK stated it was possible, concerning
SIRHAN's alleged shooting of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, that
in SIRHAN's mind, his action was a matter of honor regarding
his people or his beliefs, and would be the type who would
totally ignore the opinion of the millions who would condemn
his act, if he felt he was acting honorably.

On June 11, 1968, Mr. SAMUEL SOGHOMONIAN, Social
Science teacher at Pasadena City College, Pasadena, California,
advised he had taught SIRHAN SIRHAN in English and Social Studies
for ten hours a week during the 1959-1960 school year when
SIRHAN was attending Eliot Jr. High School, 2184 North Lake
Street, Altadena, California. Mr. SOGHOMONIAN stated that at
that time, Eliot was a 100% Caucasian school and as a result,
SIRHAN, being of swarthy complexion and foreign, stood out. He
was more or less a loner but very obedient and tractable. He
was motivated, and did well academically. Mr. SOGHOMONIAN
considered SIRHAN to be intense and with good self-discipline,
Tne other students teased SIRHAN somewhat, and did not mingle
too much with him. This did not seem to bother SIRHAN and in
fact reinforced his feeling of superiority over the average
student. Mr. SOGHOMONIAN stated that he was of Armenian
extraction and was quite friendly with SIRHAN, understanding his
problem as a foreigner. He stated a possible reason for SIRHAN's
action in shooting Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY might be based
in his background of Arab culture, as the Arabs are a very
intense and loyal people, with a strong drive to accomplish
tnat in which they believe. He believed their old fashioned
philosophy of an “eye for an eye" might have made it logical
in SIRHAN's mind to act as he did. Mr. SOGHOMONIAN stressed
that this was only surmise on his part.

Mr. SOGHOMONIAN stated he had not seen or heard from
SIRHAN after 1960, and was not aware he had attended Pasadena
City College. He knew of no Arab club or group of any kind
on the campus, but stated he was aware there were such clube on
the campuses of California State College, Los Angeles; University
of Southern California; and University of California at Los
Angeles.

years that he had attended John Muir High School, and he
remembered him as a better than average cadet with a good
attitude who accepted discipline well and showed potential
and ability in administrative positions. He said that
SIRHAN was probably a sergeant in the Cadet Corps at the
time of his graduation. He stated that he remembered
SIRHAN to be a serious individual but did not consider him
to be sullen or moody and he certainly would not have
thought him to be an individual of a violent nature. He
said that he could not remember any display of temper on the
part of SIRHAN towards any other student and, to his knowledge,
STRHAN got along well with his fellow corps members and
other students and appeared to be a very nice person,

Corps, some of the boys who were chosen to be on the Rifle
Team were afforded the opportunity for training and practice

any group or any individual.
