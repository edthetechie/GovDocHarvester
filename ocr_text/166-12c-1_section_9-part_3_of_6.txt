Washington, D.G, 20530 wth pion
Dear Mr. Baker: ont RECS

Mr. Civiletti's office suggested that I get in touch with \apR 7 19/7
you during a phone call to his office yesterday.

I just wanted to forward the enclosed material to the J Nt
appropriate people in the Justice Department for whatever —==
it is worth. a

By way of introduction, I served on the staff of former

Senator Harold Hughes for several years, and did a good deal

of the earlier investigative work on Watergate, and subsequently,
the various CIA/FBI abuses probes. During 1973 and 1974, one of
the areas I worked on was the now still emerging secret relation-
ship between elements of the Mafia and the CIA.

From that area I subsequently got involved in reviewing various
aspects of the Kennedy assassination case, playing some role

in the limited 1975-76 Senate probes into the Warren Commission
investigation.

In any event, during the past year I have co-authored a forthcoming
book on the Kennedy assassination with Bernard Fensterwald Jr.,

a former Senate counsel and Washington attorney. Our book,
Coincidence - Or Conspiracy?, will be out sometime in May, and

(we hope) will be regarded as a cautious, solid, and objective
review of the various aspects of the late President's murder.

One of the most exhaustive areas covered in the book will relate
to the various possible organized crime areas in the case.

I just wanted to take this opportunity to send you a copy of

the uncorrected proofs of our lengthy chapter on the Mafia, which
I think is perhaps the most complete such accounting yet written.
With the House Assassination Committee apparantly devoting
considerable plans to probing the alleged Mafia connection to
possible aspects of the Kennedy case, I just wanted to send in
this material for what its worth.

You'll note that our profile of Santos Trafficante Jr. - the House
Committee's uncooperative first witness - is the longest section
in the chapter, containing considerable recent information,
beginning on page 346, =

Needless to say, I've long felt that the posgibié ‘ole of | HISTICED B
organized crime in the Kennedy case has been ‘largely overlooked /'\;
or haphazardly documented. Hopefully, this nateriay wilt ba!” Y.((/

helpful in some way.

Regardless of whether or not the Kennedy case actually goes
anywhere in the months ahead, it is pleasing to know that we
finally once again have an Administration that is serious
about fighting organized crime - unlike the past eight years.

Let me know if I can ever be of any assistance to you.

Sincerely,
‘

Honorable Sirs

Inclosed for your information is an article clipped from
the October 28th edition of the National Enquirer. The item
concerns the assassination of the late Senator Kennedy.

My quéstions ares:

Has this particular avenue of investigation been
thoroughly explored?

If so, what were the results and conclusions?
If not, then why not?

fhe implications are odvious, to whit: If Mr. Sirhan
was indeed programmed through hypnosis, then there was a
conspiracy of one sort or another,

I honestly believe that we owe ourselves as a nation a
very carefull and thorough investigation of this particular
facet of the assassination; just to be absolutely certain
that we have overlooked no possibilities, -

‘ours truly, bok

ALFRED RAHEB

A source who has requested that her identity
be concealed and whose reliability is not known. to the
Bureau, has furnished information concerning the
assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

The source telephonically advised on September
16, 1975 that for the past several years, she has suspected
that an individual by the name of Alfred Raheb was possibly
involved with others in the assassination of Senator Robert
F. Kennedy.

Raheb, according to the source, was always
speaking with hate of the Kennedy family, and in particular,
of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Further, source stated that
Raheb has thrown darts at photographs of the late Senator.

Two days after Kennedy was killed, Raheb arranged
to have a withdrawal made of $4,000.00 - $5,000.00 from a
bank in Encino, California, and went to the residence of
an unidentified woman who resided about six blocks east of
Western Avenue on-Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.
The name of the bank in Encino was not recalled by the source.

ALFRED RAHEB

There were about ten individuals at the residence visited
by Raheb and all of these individuals were unknown to the
source. After leaving this apartment, Raheb proceeded to
the Fez, a night club on Vermont Avenue, Hollywood,
California, where Sirhan Sirhan's brother worked. Raheb,
according to the source, spoke -to Sirhan's brother asking,
“How's your mother, how's your brother". Raheb, the source
stated, handed the envelope containing the $4,000.00 to
$5,000.00 to Sirhan's brother and asked the brother, "Will
this be enough to take care of your mother?" The brother
indicated that it would be enough. The degree of friend-
ship between Raheb and the Sirhan family was not known to
the informant.

At the time of the assassination, Raheb, according
to the source, had a photo finishing company under contract
with the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office to develop
film made during. autopsies. The source stated that following
the autopsy of Senator Kennedy, the film was sent by the
Coroner's Office to Raheb's company for processing. The
Coroner's Office ordered transparencies to be made and Raheb
sent the film out since his firm could not make transparencies.
When the film was returned, Raheb made one five inch by eight
inch copy.of each of the transparencies for his own use and
still has the photographs.

Raheb was very close to a Dr. (First Name Unknown
FNU) Drennan, a general practitioner, who has his office on
Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles. Source described Dr.
Drennan as a white male in his 60's and a "radical" associated
with various radical movements. Dr. Drennan, according to
the source, frequently came to Raheb's photo shop.

Raheb went to either Santa Barbara or Sacramento,
California, the day before the killing of Senator Robert
F. Kennedy but. returned the morning after the killing.
Source described him on learning of the Senator's death
as "the happiest man in the world."

Raheb never discussed with the source being in-
volved in the killing. Source advised that based on the
above, source has suspected that Raheb might have been
involved and for the past several years has debated furnishing
this information.

Memorandum RL/PB
TO : FILE pate: August 5, 1975

FROM. : Richard L. Thornburgh, Assistant
Quattorney General, Criminal Division

SUBJECT: Robert Kennedy Assassination

On Friday afternoon, August 1, 1975, I returned a
previously made telephone call to me by Chief Edward Davis
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

Chief Davis advised me that in 1968, a summary of the
case reports on the Robert Kennedy assassination had been
forwarded by the Los Angeles Police Department to the
Department of Justice and was presently in the possession of
William Lynch.

At the present time, there are a number of legal
proceedings and demands for information on the part of
CBS, Paul Schrade and former representative Allard
Lowenstein to obtain copies of this information in further-
ance of alleged "conspiracy" theories. Thus far, all requests
have been denied by the courts of California and by appropriate
police authorities.

[z=] )

Chief Davis called me to insure that we EPLUMBURGE eS TR

any request for the information by releasing it. He stated
that there are three copies of the volume, ofN@NicB 4975
with the Los Angeles Police Department, _one in| the possession

written a book on the assassination, and th¢
the Department of Justice.

On checking with Mr. Lynch, I learned that he had been
part of a special Department of Justice team dispatched to
monitor the investigation of the Kennedy assassination, at
the conclusion of which effort the volumes in question were
presented to him. They are presently in the files of the
Department of Justice. There are also, according to Mr. Lynch,

Buy U.S. Savings Bonds Regularly on the Payroll Savings Plan

5010-410


--- Page 29 ---
Memo to file
Re: Robert Kennedy Assassination
August 5, 1975

pending applications under the Freedom of Information Act
to obtain the Department's copy.

At some time past, consideration has been given to
the proper disposition of this material, including the
possibility that it might be deposited in the National
Archives or even sent back to the Los Angeles Police
Department.

I told Chief Davis we would take no action inimicable
to his request without first checking with him, but
acknowledged that there may be some problems under the
Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.

DANIEL T. ESTRADA

On July 6, 1976, Daniel T. Estrada, 1352 Volney
Drive, Los Angeles, California, Telephone Number 261-7612,
called this office from the East Los Angeles Municipal
Court where he was appearing on a narcotics and burglary
charge.

Estrada advised that he had information on the
Robert Kennedy murder and that the source of his information
was Sirhan Sirhan who was in an adjacent cell to him when
he was in San Quentin.

Estrada stated that he would provide information
in exchange for whatever the Federal Bureau of Investigation
could do to help him with the local authorities. Estrada
was advised that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would
not and could not make any deal with him.

Further Estrada stated that Sirhan had already had
a Ronald Wood murdered in the Nevada State Penitentiary because
he was talking to Federal agents about the same information.

In connection with another investigation conducted
by the Federal Bureau of Investisation, it was learned that
Sirhan Sirhan had determined that Ronald Wood, who was
incarcerated at San Quentin Penitentiary at the same time as

Re: DANIEL T. ESTRADA

Sirhan was going to write an article about Sirhan that
would be a complete fabrication and Sirhan was fearful
that it would effect his parole status. Sirhan had
another imaate at S:m Quentin Penitentiary write up an
affidavit to the cffeet that Sirhan had never confided in
or furnished infermation to Wood and that Wood intended to
fictionalize the information for an alleged magazine
article.

: Information was received from the Las Vegas
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Ronald
Wood was received at the Nevada State Penitentiary on
March 30, 1973, from San Quentin Penitentiary as a protective
custody prisoner and was found dead in his cell on
September 21, 1974. Wood had been bludgeoned to death
and his murder has not been solved to date. ‘Two theories
were advanced in connection with this murder, one that he
was an informant and another that he was a known drug
salesman in prison and that he had sold drugs that were
substandard and had refused a refund on these drugs.

No further inquiry or investigation is being
conducted by the Iederal Bureau of Investigation on the
information furnished by Daniel T. Estrada.

Dear Sir:

How can our laws be so stupid as to be able to
release a murderer like Sirhan Sirhan after only a
few years in prison for his assassination of Robert
Kennedy. He should at the very least be given a life
imprisonment sentence if not executed for his crime.

Our laws are unthinkably stupid and should be
changed for the benefit of the people and not for
the benefit of criminals.

SUBJECT: Freedom of Information Request by Congressman Don Edwards
for LAPD Summary of Investigation into Assassination of
Robert F. Kenned

Here is the FOIA request and information I have received
to date, .

It seems to me that the proper way to handle the request is
to determine whose Division has had the greater contact with the
case. As you mentioned, your Division has had more correspondence
than ours, and is probably the correct Division to respond,

The factor that led me to decide that you can better handle
the matter was that the assignment for the enclosures was directed
to Civil Rights Division. The enclosures concern FBI reports and
other trial information. Of the papers I have seen, these are
most like the material sought by the request.

I first attempted to treat this as a Congressional inquiry
but Sue Hauser in the Deputy's office vetoed the idea after con-
sultation with OLC. Ms. Hauser requested that we send a letter
extending time, and she purportedly notified both your Division
and the FBI.

In Section 8 of the file is an FOIA request, handled before
the amendments, for the same documents. I marked this with a paper-
clip and a sheet of paper. The indication of the memos is that the
FBI has the volumes sought by the request. My cursory examination
of the enclosures leads me to conclude that we do not have the
volumes; rather, the FBI does.

I checked classification for Civil Rights (X 3010)) they tell
me that their records indicate your Division handles file number
166-12cC-1.

Sue Hauser (X 2146) has been notified of the transfer.
