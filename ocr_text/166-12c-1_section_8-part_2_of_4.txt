* DAILY NEWS, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1970

"Hoover s

Mitchell, meeting the press for
the first time in five months,
sidestepped a number of ques-
tions’ on the 75-year-old FBI
chief’s headJine-making pro-
nouncements, some of which have
sparked congressional calls for
Hoover’s resignation.

“IT wouldn’t try to impede Mr.
Hoover’s freedom of speech,”
said Mitchell, who, on paper at
least, is Hoover's boss,

“Until he gets to the point
where he is doing something im-
proper—and he hasn’t come any-
where near reaching that. point,
and I don’t expect him to—he
can say anything he wants to,”
Mitchell declared.

In recent testimony before Con-
gress, Hoover accused two anti-
war priests, the Revs. Philip and
Daniel Berrigan, of leading a con-
spiracy to kidnap a high govern-
ment official.

In an interview, Hoover labeled
former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark a “jellyfish,” and blasted
another former attorney general,
the late Robert F. Kennedy, for
wanting to recruit more Negro
G-men. ‘

And Hoover told a news maga-
zine that Mexicans and Puerto
Ricans pose little threat to a
President because “they can’t

shoot straight.”

Hoover added, however: “If
they come at you with a knife,
beware.”

These last remarks led Rep. Ed-

Isn't Upset Yet
Washington, Dec. 18 (NEWS Bureau)—Attorney General John Mitchell said today

he would back FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover—and his controversial public statements—
“yntil he gets to the point where he is doing something improper.”

ward Roybal (D-Calif.) to de-
mand that President Nixon ask
for the director’s resignation. Sen.
Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.) was
just as upset, but all he asked for
was a public apology. Roybal’s
request got a noncommittal, two-
sentence reply from a White
House aide. Montoya said he has-
n’t even received that yet. - .

Mitchell said today that “in
context,” Hoover meant no racial
slur.

“Haven't Been Asked”

On other matters, Mitchell
sought to put down persistent re-
ports that he will*soon quit the
cabinet to run Nixon's 1972 re-
election campaign.

“T havn't been asked, and I sure
as hell am not going to volunteer
for it,” Mitchell said. Two years
ago Mitchell was Nixon’s cam-
paign manager. Today the attor-
ney general described the’ Presi-
dent’s reelection chances as “ex-
cellent.”

Campus Decisions

On other matters, Mitchell:

@ Said the federal government
plans no further action in the
slaying of two young blacks at
Jackson State College in Missis-
sippi last spring, and that no
decision had been made on wheth-
er a federal grand jury probe of
the Kent State shootings is nec-
essary.
® Said “the total matter of
housing patterns in desegregation
is under review.”

@ Announced the filing of a
suit against the huge Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corp. for dis-
charging cyanide into the Cuya-
hoga River near Cleveland. It
was the second water pollution
suit filed by the Justice Depart-
ment since the establishment two
weeks ago of the Environmental
Protection Agency.

Receipt is acknowledged of your commumication of
November 10, 1970, (RGK:UNsHTE:mam 156-12C-1) captioned
"Sirhan 3B. Sirhan" wherein advice is requested as to
whether FBI reports vere made avallable to defense counsel
in the Sirtian Bishara Sirhan case. Onclosed vith your
communication vas a letter to the cttorney General dated
October 19, 1970, from Bernard Fenstervald, Jr., requesting
results of FBI investigation into this case.

For your information, copies of FBI reports in this
matter vere not made available to defense counsel by our
Los /ngeles office. However, coples of these reports vere
furnished to the Los Angeles County, California, District
Attorney's Office vith the request that the reports not be
disseminated outside that office. The Los Angeles County
Jistrict Attorney's Office did not furnish copies of FBI
reports in this matter to the defense.

Defense counsel through the court demanded production
of the Los Angeles, California, Police vepartment and FBI
interviews of pertinent individuals in connection vith the
investigation. Review of these interviews was made by the
prosecution and copies of recucsted intervievs made. This
materlal was then taken to the court and upon proper order
turned over to the defense by the court. io restrictions
were imposed concerning the use which could be made of this
material,

a request for

access to official records under 5 U.S.c. 552(a) and

28 CFR Part 16.

The records sought are an FBI file with respect to Sirhan
B. Sirhan.

If it were not for the fact that the file in question had
been made available to writer Robert Blair Kaiser, and
had not Mr. Kaiser made this fact known in his new book,
RFK Must Die, [please see Attachment], you might be in-
clined to answer that the records in question were within
an exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552. However, as they have been
made available to a commercial writer and are the basis,
at least in part, for his published book, we can see no
reason why they should not be made equally available to
our Committee, as 5 U.S.C. 552 require equality of treat-
ment in access to records.

Therefore, we hope that the records can be made available
without serious delay.

Most respectfully y

“, . . did anybody pay you to shoot Kennedy?” 321

“Of course it does,” said Berman, wondering to himself just how the
gadge could be persuaded to let that happen.

“And I've got some books,” said Jabara fiercely, “that ought to go in
tusdence.”

“I'd like to have them right away,” said Berman. “And anything else
you've got on the subject.”

Jabara smiled and relaxed enough to enjoy the greatest fried shrimp in
town. “Okay,” he said. “Okay.”

“Here,” I said, pushing a plate at Jabara, “have a fortune cockie and see
what the fates have in store.”

Jabara took a sip of tea, opened his cookie carefully and burst into a
far of laughter. He handed over a tiny scrap of paper imprinted with the
wetage: “DON’T LET YOUR ENTHUSIASM OVERRIDE THE
REALITY AROUND YOU.” Jabara laughed again.

While the lawyers settled down to the weary task of picking twelve jurors
‘ead six alternates, I continued to read the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
twa's Office File 56-156, Bureau File No. 62-587. It was impressively
deavy, comprising at least_4,000 pages of reports from special agents all,
«eet the United States who looked into the case of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan
"jon request of the Attorney General of the United States under the
Coil Rights Act of 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.”

And it was well written. The report of the assassination itself by Ama-
de O Richards, Jr., of the Los Angeles office was a model of telegraphic
ahenty.

At approximately 12:15 a.m., 6/5/68, Senator ROBERT. F. KENNEDY
preclaimed victory in California primary election in crowded Embassy
foam, Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles. As SEN-
ATOR KENNEDY and party were leaving Embassy Room through kitchen
aut, a series of shots were fired by an unknown individual, subsequently
wxaufied as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. SENATOR KENNEDY fell
‘ichward onto floor, critically wounded with bullet in brain. SIRHAN wres-
sw} to floor, disarmed and turned over to Los Angeles, California, police
apartment (LAPD).

ise reports gave me a chance to verify many of the associations Sirhan
we! stready told me about. Here were summaries of FBI interviews with
grse3s Who had known Sirhan in school and with some of those who had
