guilty to the charge of murder in the slaying of ROBERT F.
KENNEDY.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge RICHARD SCHAUER
set the trial date for November 1, 1968, in this matter.
‘ Represented by his attorney, RUSSELL E. PARSONS,
SIRHAN also pled not guilty to feloniously assaulting, with a
deadly weapon and with intent to commit murder, five other
persons wounded the same night at the election celebration at
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California.

Judge SCHAUER did not at this hearing name the
judge who will preside over the case.

Also at this hearing, Los Angeles County District
Attorney EVELLE J. YOUNGER, assisted by Deputy District Attor-
neys JOHN HOWARD and DAVID FITTS, asked thes Judge SCHAUER
vacate or modify a previous court order restricting publicity
in this case.

SIRHAN's attorney RUSSELL E. PARSONS and A. L. WIRIN,
Chief Counsel of the Southern California Chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, opposed the motion of
YOUNGER. WIRIN was allowed to appear as a "friend" of the
court. .

The motion of YOUNGER regarding publicity on this
case was denied by Superior Court Judge RICHARD SCHAUER.

On September 10, 1968, District Attorney EVELLE J.
YOUNGER signed an appeal requesting that the court order
Limiting publicity in the SIRHAN case be modified. The
District Attorney sought reversal of the order in a petition
for a writ of mandate and prohibition from the State Court of
Appeal.

FRANCES A. BATLEY, 2981 West ighth Street, Apartment
218, Los Angeles, California, advised the following:

BAILEY claimed that she could not furnish any ad-
ditional information to that furnished during interview by an
agent of the FBI on June 14, 1968. At that time she stated
that when she was on duty in the uniform room of the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 2, 1968, two Caucasian
males came to her window and asked to borrow waiter's jackets
so they could use them to get in to see Senator KENNEDY who
was then at the hotel. Her recollection was that these two
men, who were unknown to her, had no authority to obtain the
jackets. Their request was refused by BAILEY, who said that
she was busy, and since there was quite a bit of activity,
she did not pay close attention to these individuals to the

xtent that she could describe them in detail. She was of
the impression that they were of dark complexion but was sure
that she would be unable to recognize them should she see
them again.

Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN and members of his
family were exhibited to BAILEY who said that she had no recol-
lection of ever having observed any of the individuals in the
photographs at any time.

about 30 years olds, had asked for a busboy's uniform, but he
did not have the necessary card with which to obtain the uniform.
When he was unable to produce such a card, he turned and just
walked away. ; :

WISHNUCK said that she did not feel that she could
identify the Negro male if she ever saw him again and that no
other employee to her knowledge observed this man. She stated
she has never seen this man since and has no idea who he may
have been.

WISHNUCK examined photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN anc
members of his family and said that she had no recollection of

the hotel put on a number of extra employees. The Security
_ Department hired six extra guards Whom they have used in
the past and who were all on duty at the time of the shooting.
Senator KENNEDY had refrained from using any security
guards, consequently specific security assignments were not
made to guard him. .GARDNER selected two waiter captains to
lead the KENNEDY procession to and from the Embassy Room
“where Senator KENNEDY was to speak.

The KENNEDY campaign party did not have any. dinner arrange

‘ments, so there were no large number of extra waiters hired.

Department and extra bartenders were used. The various

departments hiring these extra employees normally utilized
. extra employees with whom they have had previous experience

and every department would be accountable for the extra

employees hired.

During the evening the Fmbassy Room was extremely
crowded. There was no attempt to challenge any persons
coming or going until the room reached capacity and then

persons Were denied entrance on the basis that the
overcrowding would create a fire hazard. Persons entering
the Embassy Roomwere not challenged continually except
when the fire hazard approach was used to stop thems and
Anyone wishing to get in would have had little trouble.

Concerning an orange colored pamphlet which vore
the caption "Kill Kennedy" which Mr. GARDNER was alleged
to have displayed to ELMER M, BOOMHOWER, an employee of
the Ace Guard Service, Granada Hills, on the night of
Junie 4, 1968, GARDNER advised as follows:

During the height of the Senator KENNEDY campaign
party it was mentioned to GARDNER by some of the hotel
employees, identitie-not recalled, that bumper stickers
were being passedoutinthe front of the lobby and in front
of the Embassy Room which bore lettering about killing
KENNEDY. The persons reportedly passing out these bumper ;
stickers were described as being young people, “hippie type."

A hotel employee had furnished one of the stickers to
GARDNER who said that it was a reddish orange in color
with black lettering. He did not recall the exact caption
on the bumper sticker but in substance the wording justified
the killing of JOHN F, KENNEDY and did not pertain to
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. GARDNER said that he had

turned this bumper sticker over to the Los Angeles Police
Department after the shooting of Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. PATRICK MURPHY, Security Division, Ambassador
Hotel, Los Angeles, said that he was aeting Security Officer
in charge in the absence of Chief Security Officer VARDIGNAN T.
MOON who had recently replaced WILLIAM F, GARDNER, the
Security Officer who was at the Ambassador Hotel at the
time when Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was shot. Mr. GARDNER
can now be reached at 221 North Belmont Street, phone
254-3256.

Concerning the number of extra employees hired
at the time of the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign
party at the Ambassador Hotel on the evening of June 4, 1968,
and the morning of June 5, 1968, Mr. MURPHY said that
there were a few extra employees hired in the Security
Department as well as the Room Service Departinent and
among the bartenders. Normally the hotel maintains a list
of extra workers in the various departments who are_called
when needed. The various department heads would be aware
of the identities of the extra employees hired during that
affair or any extra or new employees hired a short period
before the affair.MURPHY advised that Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
“had refused to utilize any security from the hotel and
consequently no specific security assignments were given
and MURPHY himself had a roving assignment to
look out for the hotel's interests, MURPHY spent a good
part of the evening in the lobby and the area of the
Embassy Room. There were thousands of people running in
and out of the Embassy Room and when it became full,
the firemen on duty would not let any additional people
in the room until someone came out. When this happened
before midnight, those people who could not get into the
Embassy Room were going in through the kitchen area and
were coming in through the back entrance of the Embassy Roam which opened
through the kitchen. There were two separate, swinging
door entrances through the kitchen and there was no one
challenging anyone coming in and out of the kitchen until
so many people attempted to go through the kitchen that
MURPHY took a stand in front of one of the swinging door
entrances of the kitchen and began to keep people out.

BIDSTRUP could not recall. No discussion or particular
interest in Senator KENNEDY came up during this man's
presence in the booth.

There was a Los Angeles Fireman on duty in the
Venetian Room who was present when BIDSTRUP was talking
to the unknown male. The name of this fireman was not

those gathered in the Embassy Room of the hotel. He said he
accompanied KENNEDY from his suite, using a service elevator
and passing through an area where KENNEDY was later shot. He
said that en route to the Embassy Room he did not note any
particular crowd in the area where the Senator was: shot.

DUTTON said he was aware that a large crowd had
gathered in the Embassy Room as well as in a lower ballroom
for the expected appearance of Senator KENNEDY, He said these
crowds had become rather loud and somewhat unruly awaiting the
appearance of the Senator.

DUTTON stated he decided that upon the completion of
Senator KENNEDY's victory talk, the Senator would go to the
Colonial Room where the press had gathered, rather than to go
down to the lower ballroom,

He said Senator KENNEDY left the podium at the rear
of the platform and he followed the Senator, accompanied by
Mrs, KENNEDY, DUTTON said he did not tell Senator KENNEDY that
he was to proceed to the Colonial Room, but believed that BILL
BARRY had done so, as BARRY was aware of the plan.

to eight feet when he heard a snapping noise, similar to the
sound of fire-crackers, He said upon learning that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot, he proceeded directly to KENNEDY, passing

\his victory speech in the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel,
;would then go to a room occupied by SALINGER which was to the
‘right of Senator KENNEDY and then the Senator would go on to

He stated when Senator KENNEDY finished his talk he
left the podium and proceeded toward the Colonial Room which
was off to his left. He said he attached no significance to
ithe fact Senator KENNEDY proceeded in the direction of the
. ‘Colonial Room, as the routes taken by Senator KENNEDY were
not definite and he often went directly into a crowd rather
than through some easier and less crowded route as planned.
He stated BILL BARRY or FRED DUTTON might possibly know why
‘Senator KENNEDY proceeded to the Colonial Room after his talk.

| MANKIEWICZ stated he trailed Senator KENNEDY by
about ten to twelve feet as he moved toward the Colonial Room.
He said as he passed through some double doors he heard a
noise, similar to the sound of fire crackers, and thought it
was inappropriate to be setting off fire crackers.

He stated he never saw SIRHAN SIRHAN, the suspected
assassin of Senator KENNEDY, and as he moved forward he recalled
seeing PAUL SCHRADE, a United Auto Workers official, lying on
the floor about two feet from the body of Senator KENNEDY .

- He said he then saw a "tableau" of arms in a struggle
and a gun lying on a table. He said he could not see the head

Mv. WILLIAM NORRIS, Partner, Law Firm of Tuttle

_ Angeles, phone number 625-7831, advised that during the
campaign of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY for the presidential
nomination, he, NORRIS, acted as one of twelve State of
California Vice Chairmen under Chairman JESSE UNRUH.
In this capacity, he associated with the Senator and other
members of the Senator's staff, and based on his, NORRIS!
position, he furnished the following information with
respect to his knowledge of the events of June 4, 1968, and
June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel.

NORRIS advised that he went to the Ambassador Hotel
at approximately 8:30 pm, and parked in the rear parking
‘lot. He then entered the hotel and went to the KENNEDY
press area, located in the Colonial Room, where he talked
with various campaign personalities. At approximately
10:00 pm, he went upstairs to the KENNEDY suite, where he
stayed for approximately 45 minutes. He then went downstairs
to the Embassy Room, where he met several friends and took
. them to the KENNEDY suite to meet the Senator. Shortly
thereafter, he returned to the Embassy Room and met other
loyal supporters who also wanted to meet the Senator,
gust as he was about to take them upstairs, he saw STEPHEN
SMITH, the Senator's brother-in-law, so he delayed his
trip upstairs as he realized that the Senator would appear
in the Ballroom in a few minutes.

When the Senator arrived, he, NORRIS, remained
in the press alcove of the Embassy Room, just to the west
of the platform. After his speech, the Senator left the
platform to the rear, through some curtains which provided
access to the kitchen area and the main KENNEDY press room.
He, NORRIS, attempted to follow from the Embassy press area

ROYER was standing on a chair looking down the passageway
toward the Senator and he assumes that she must have seen
some of the actual shooting. There also were loud shouts
and screaming in the air,

Shortly thereafter, many rumorg were spread about concern-
ing who was shot. He heard that STEVE SMITH, FRED DUTTON, and
PAUL SCHRADE, had been shot as well as the Senator. The
facts soon developed, however, that STEVE SMITH and FRED
DUTTON had not been shot, for he saw both of them and they
were uninjured. It was then that SMITH told him that the
Senator had been shot, and that they should get all the
people out of the Ballroom, He, NORRIS, emphatically
concurred and suggested that SMITH himself make a public
announcement, since such an announcement coming from a
member of the KENNEDY family would have more meaning to
those assembled in the Ballroom. Mr. SMITH then made the
announcement to clear the Ballroom. NORRIS advised that he
stayed at the hotel until approximately 3:00 am, helping to
clear the area and talking to various friends,

He was shown a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
and he stated that at no time during the evening did he
see this individual.

He advised the security in the KENNEDY suite
upstairs in the hotel was almost nonexistent, and that it
was fairly loose early in the evening at the Embassy Room,
but that as the evening wore on it became more difficult to

‘gain access to that room. He stated that he bases this
observation on his ability to gain access to those areas
during the evening. No one checked his press pass in the
KENNEDY suite. At approximately 10:30 pm, a guard was at
the Embassy Room and the guard checked his pass, but later
on at approximately 11:00 pm, the guard denied him access
to the room, so he entered it #hrough another back entrance.

safety of the Senator during his campaign, discussed this
with STEPHEN SMITH in his, NORRIS', presence on one of the
Senator's earlier trips to California. PALMIERI suggested
that stringent security be provided for the Senator, but

a

Date. 6/25/68 | .

| Mr. CHARLES "CHUCK" BAILEY, Minneapolis Tribune,
Washington Bureau, National Press Building, Washington, D.C.,
(WeC), furnished the following information? |.

He accompanied the Late Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
oh both the Oregon and California’Primariesandwas at the
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, on the morning
ef June 5, 1958, when Senator KENNEDY was assassinated.

At the exact time of the shooting of Mr. KENNEDY, he was in
the Coloniai Room of the Hotel Ambassador along with the
other newspaper people waiting for Mr. KENNEDY to come into
the Colonial Room for an informal press conference. Separating
the Colonial Room from the kitchen of the hotél were double -
swinging doors and then another set of double swinging
doors arranged in such a Manner that people in the Colonial
Room could not see into the kitchen when a waiter came out
ef the serving kitchen. It was his understanding that ,
immediately after Mr. KENNEDY gave a victory talk on tele-
vision, he intended to come into the Colonial Room and talk |
to the reporters gathered there awaiting him. He believes
that it was one of the press secretaries of Mr. KENNEDY,
the exact one he could not recall, who made these arrangements,
but that in any event it was his understanding at the time
that Mr. KENNEDY would come directly from his TV talk to .
the Colonial. Room and that reporters there would be able to
ask him questions concerning his primary victory and future

lans. He saw on a TV set that Mr. KENNEDY had finished

is speech and so then he immediately moved closer to the
door so he would have a better position in proximity to
Mir, KENNEDY to ask questions. He then heard a loud bang
which at first sounded to him like someone was banging a
serving tray on one of the stainless steel warming counters.
This was immediately followed by four other "bang-like" =.
poises, and then it dawned on him that these were actually
shots from a gun. He distinctly recalled only hearing five
bangs although subsequent events revealed that actually
eight shots were fired frea a gun. He immediately went
through the double set of swinging doors into the serving
kitchen, and the place was "complete bedlam." He noticed
someone struggling with an individual but actually only saw

this individual's forearm raised in the air and someone
grabbing at it. He cannot recali actually seeing a gun

in the hand of the alleged assassin. He then left the ;
serving kitchen immediately and went to the nearest phone 7
to call his paper. When he finished the call, he went back

to the serving kitchen, it being only a matter of perhaps

ten or fifteen minutes; and at this time the police were taking
out of the hotel the alleged assassin of Mr. KENNEDY, SIRHAN
SIRHAN. On this occasion he got a reasonably good view

of SIRHAN. He does not recall ever seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN
before that time either in the hotel or at any of the

campaign stops. He did not see any girl at any time wearing

a@ polka dot dress and could furnish no information whatsoever
concerning this alleged individual.

On the previous Sunday before the assassination
of Mr. KENNEDY, he was in the group of newspapermen: who
"covered" Nir. KENNEDY's trip to Disneyland and diu not
recall seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN in any of the crowds gathered

around Mr. KENNEDY at Disneyland,

. Mr. BAILEY was unable to furnish any additional
pertinent information.
