' ployed as an Inquiry Clerk in the U. S. Post Office, San

Mrs. BROWN has been active in Indian affairs and
the AIC in San Francisco since 1957 and is well acquainted
with most of the Indians in the San Francisco Bay Area.

She recalls that a hearing by the U. S. Senate
Sub-Committee was held at the AIC in San Francisco in
January 1968 but she did riot attend this hearing.

Mrs. BROWN was shown a group photograph taken at
the hearing which included the late Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
and a Mrs. STELLA R. LEACH. There appears on this photograph
between Senator KENNEDY and Mrs. LEACH, a portion of the face
of an unidentified individual. Mrs. BROWN stated that she
is unable to identify this individual and pointed out that
his. appearance is similar to most male Indians. She feels
that it would not be possible to identify this individual
unless a picture showing more of his face is available.

BEN-JABR was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, as well as ADEL SIRHAN, SHARIF SIRHAN, SAIDALLAH
STRHAN, and MUNIR SIRHAN, all brothers of STRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN. After viewing these photographs, BEN-JABR advised

driving a 1959 white Chevrolet between approxina te ly
11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on June 4, 1968, in the parking
lot at the Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
Angeles. BEN-JABR noted that besides the driver three
other individuals occupied this vehicle, one in the front
passenger seat, and the other two in the rear seat. Although
BEN-JABR did not closely observe these latter three
individuals and could not describe them other than to say
that the one in the front seat was wearing a short sleeve
shirt he does not récall these three individuals resembling

/ the individuals depicted in the above photographs.

BEN-FABR indicated that he recognized the above
photograph of ADEL SIRHAN as being identical to an individual
who performed as a musician at the "Fez," a nightclub located
at Sunset and Vermont, Hollywood, California, in 1965 and/or
1966. BEN-JABR was not acquainted with ADEL SIRHAN and has
never spoken with this individual. Although he has previously
observed photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, to the best of
his knowledge, he has never observed in person this individual
or SHARIF SIRHAN, SATDALLAH SITRHAN, or MUNTIR SIRHAN.

Mr. GRANT HOLCOMB, Manager, News Division of
Columbia Broadcasting System (CBs) owned KNXT-Channel ¢@,
6121 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, advised
the following with respect to a request to interview
three employees of the KNXT News Department:

Mr. HOLCOMB was advised that the employees had
reportedly been present at the Ambassador Hotel on the
morning of June 5, 1968, at the time Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY was shot. The purpose was to ascertain if the
employees might be potential witnesses to the shooting of
Senator KENNEDY. The employees were ELIZABETH HERMAN,
Junior News Writer; JOE DYER, former Reporter, now in the
Community Relations Department; and JIM BROWN, News Reporter.
It was mentioned that JOE DYER had already been contacted
and had mentioned a new policy in effect with respect to
government investigators interviewing CBS personnel.

Mr. HOLCOMB said in substance that the new policy
required that if, in the opinion of the Legal Department of
CBS, the CBS employee should be made available for interview
by government investigators, the latter would have to secure
and serve a subpoena on the employee before the employee,
could be interviewed. /

Mr. HOLCOMB said the decision for adapting this
policy had originated in the CBS headquarters in New York
City, and he did not know the full details on which the
policy mas formulated.

SAIDALLAH B, SIRHAN, who shares a flat with him at this address
and Mr. ANTHONY SHERMAN, JR., @ representative of the United

SIRHAN was advised by SA POWELL that the inquiry
related to the authorship of a two-page written document addresged
to President Elect RICHARD NIXON and Vice President HUBERT
HUMPHREY, bearing the signature SHARIF B, SIRHAN. Mr, SIRHAN
was then orally advised of his rights by SAs POWELL and REILLY,
He was asked by SA REILLY to read an Advice of Rights Form.

Mr, SIRHAN interrupted this to say, "Before I say anything, I
want to see the letter." A copy of the above mentioned letter
was given to him to read. He read it slowly, line by line, his
hands visibly shaking, although he showed no other signs of
emotion,

Mr, SIRHAN then said, "I did not write this. It is
not mine." He then indicated he was certainly in agreement with
some of the political statements contained in the letter and had
himself expressed some of these ideas, but he would not specify
which of these points he was referring to. He stated he also
disagreed with some of the points in the letter.

denied that the signature at the end of the letter was his and
added that the signature appearing on the letter was not a good

sometimes signs himself SHARIF B, SIRHAN, sometimes SHARIF
STRHAN,

He said he did not know what kind of a typewriter this was,

He indicated that he did not use it,

Mr, SIRHAN said he does not know about any such
organization in the United States as "the Palestine Commandos"

been written by another member of his family or anyone of his
acquaintance,

Myr, SIRHAN turned to the contents of the letter and
said the thoughts expressed in the letter could be the thoughts
of a majority of persons living in the United States. He then
with some emotion bitterly described the manner in which he had
been treated since the assassination of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY,
He spoke of people "staring at him everywhere he went", of

people coming to his home and asking him questions. He said
"They say my brother killed him, Why do they have to come to
me with all their questions. I didn't kill him." At this
point Mr, SIRHAN was reminded of the purpose of the interview
and the reasons therefor, but he appeared upset and said he had
nothing to add on this matter and the interview was terminated,

very insistent and became rather "nasty" in his speech when

oN 56-94.

The Jackson, Mississippi Office of the FBI advised
as follows on October 21, 1968:

On October 10, 1968, a young female telephonically
contacted the Jackson Office of the FBI and identified her-
self as Miss SUBRINA DUBLE, white female, age 17. She re~-
fused to give her home address or telephone number but stated
the nature of her call was to furnish the FBI with important
information concerning the assassination of ROBERT F, KENNEDY.
Miss DUBLE related a very rambling episode of how she met an
individual in California whom she had cause to believe was
involved in the assassination of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.
She stated she has had knowledge of this since May 1968, but
declined to report this information due to threatening phone
calls and letters warning her to keep anything she might know
to herself.

She stated she is a resident of Alabama but did not
wish to be contacted at home due to her father's condition,
as she is afraid that any upsetting incident might cause him
to have another stroke. She did state, however, that she
could be reached at telephone number 762-9920, a pay phone
in Pascagoula, Mississippi, any time between 9:00 and 11:00
pem. any night.

During this call she stated that she was upset
over something that had happened just prior to the call and
she seemed out of breath.

Attempts were made to recontact her on the night
of October 11 and 13, 1968, with negative results.

On October 14, 1968, investigation revealed that
telephone number 762-9920 is located in an outdoor telephone
booth on the premises of Larry's Standard Service Station
located at Market Street and Highway U. S. 90 in Pascagoula.
The proprietor of this station advised that the name SUBRINA
DUBLE is unknown to him and that he closes at 8:00 p.m.

TN 56-94.

Inquiry among people who live in the immediate vicinity of
this telephone revealed that this is a Negro community and
the name SUBRINA DUBLE is not known there. A review of
Pascagoula City Directory and telephone directory revealed
no listing for anyone named DUBLE.

G. R. THOMPSON, Identification Officer, Pascagoula,
Mississippi Police Department, advised on October 14, 1968,
that he has no record of anyone named DUBLE.

On October 16, 1968, this individual again called the
Jackson Office and was connected with an agent in Biloxi,
Mississippi. She stated she had called to say that she wanted
to drop the matter and did not want to meet with an agent.
She persistently declined to further identify herself or to
agree to meet the agent. She finally did agree to call him
again after she had spoken to her father. Throughout the
conversation with her, her conversation appeared to be ramb-
ling and disconnected.

On October 19, 1968, she telephonically contacted an
agent of the FBI at Biloxi, Mississippi, and at that time
agreed to meet him in the lobby of the LaFont Inn, a motel
on Highway U. S. 90 in Pascagoula at 9:00 on the evening of
October 20, 1968. She again refused to further identify
herself except to say that she is tall, has white blonde
hair and a mole on her face.

On the evening of October 20, 1968, an agent of the
FBI remained in the vicinity of the lobby of the LaFont
Inn from 9:00 p.m., until after 10:00 p.m., but Miss DUBLE
did not appear.

Qc33_ Photocopy of two-page handwritten letter dated 6/11/68,
bearing message in Serbo-Croation language (copy of
original letter previously submitted)

-Ke23 Photocopy of two-page letter dated at Paris, 5/24/66,

Ke24 Photocopy of two-page letter in Serbo-Croation language,
dated 1/22/68, purportedly written by DJURO STOKIC, and
attached copy of photograph, alleged to be that of the
writer

Result of examination:

It was found that the purported writing of DJURO STOKIC

appearing on the submitted photocopies designated.Kc23 and Kce24

is entirely too indistinct to permit a suitable comparison with

the questioned writing on the two-page letter designated as Q33.
Specimen Q33 is the original letter for the photocopy Qc33. Q33
and the envelope in which it was mailed, designated Q.32, are |
described in FBI Laboratory report dated 8/23/68, a copy of which
was furnished to the Director, U.S. Secret Service, Washington, D.C.
Photocopies of Q32 and Q33.were furnished with FBI Laboratory ae
report of 8/23/68. _

; Due to the indistinctness of the writing on Kc23 and
Kce24, a definite conclusion was not reached whether DJURO STOKIC
wrote the questioned writing on Q32 and Q33. Certain handwriting
‘characteristics were noted in the purported known writing of .
DJURO STOKIC on kc23 and Ke24 which are consistent with handwriting
characteristics in the letter designated as Q33. These consistences
in handwriting characteristics indicate that Q33 may have been
written by DIURO STOKIC. :

The submitted material is being reta “eined in’ the FBI files.

; : On October 28, 1968, the United States Secret Service
Headquarters, Washington, D.C., furnished the FBI Headquarters,
Washington, D.C., a copy of a communication addressed. to
RICHARD NIXON and HUBERT HUMPHREY, National Headquarters,
. Willard Hotel, Washington, D.C. This communication was
allegedly signed by SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN and postmarked Pasadena,
California, October 22, 1968.
The return address was indicated as SHARIF Be
STRHAN, 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, California, and the
envelope was addressed to Mr. NIXON. The two page letter
begins with "How do you justify taking one land from one
people, etc." and ends with _eeefor the sake of justice and
' the world peace, thank you."

This letter was forwarded to the FBI Laboratory
for appropriate comparison.

THE RESULTS OF THE FBI LABORATORY EXAMINATION.

The FBI Laboratory on November 12, 1968, advised
that the above described document is identified by the
Laboratory as Qe35.

The "SHARIF B, SIRHAN" signature on Qc35 is entirely
too indistinct to permit a suitable comparison with the known
handwriting of SHARIF SIRHAN identified as K1l2. The limited
comparison that could be made indicates that SHARIF SIRHAN may
not have written the signature on Qc35 and a more detailed
examination will be made upon receipt of the original Qc35
or a more detailed copy thereof.
