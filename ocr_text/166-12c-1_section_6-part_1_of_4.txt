Dear Mr. President:

I know that the Sirhan Sirhan murder trial ts over, but
I would like to know more about trials of this kind. It
seems to me that the trial took too long. Ina murder
such as this, there were many witnesses who saw Sirhan
Sirhan murder Mr. Robert Kennedy. My opinion is that
Sirhan Sirhan was without a doubt, guilty.

Why do we have to spend the taxpayer's money on such a_
long trial. The man is guilty as everyone saw. Someone
in the United States Government should have the power to
send him to jail or to his death without the need of a
long court trial.

I would appreciate hearing from you and what your opinion +
is in this matter.

Your fellow American,

Ruth Villarreal

Honorable John Mitchell

Attorney General of the United States

c/o Postmaster, Washin . Main Post Office
North Capitol & Ma

= ” \7
Washington, D.C./ RECEIVED

Dear Sir:

A young Jordanian natio as recently been placed as
on the Altar of false pride of many public officials

set a good example in administering justice. This however, has R.A.0.
become the rule in California courts not the exceptio
decisions based on presumption and assumption of guil
because circumstantial evidence has been deliberately placed in
erder to have a victim to appease a public that demands a life for
a life.

I_ personally challenge the mental competence of those who have so
betrayed the American ideals to become such _a travesty of justice
Mental competence in this case I wish to define as the use of the
facts (concrete) objectively employed purposively as a means toward
an end. It_is in my own personal opinion based on the facts as they
came over the newscasts, the newspaper, and personal acquired know-
jedge that it would have been a SP eeicat impossibility for Sirhan
Sirhan to have been e one to re the fatal bullets. ere were
three bullets that penetrated Senator Kennedys brain from the rear,
Senator Kennedy was facing Sirhan the only way that it would have
been possible would have been for the bullets to have hit a very hard
object and ricocheted back, thus losing much of the force where they
might have only grazed his skull. There were however six other
people injured that were taken to different hospitals, but the names
and hospitals would still be in the newspaper files, This would have
| meant that two guns were used instead of one. Who was it that took
I
1
vo

the gun from Sirhan and turned it over to the authorities? Were
there any tests made to see if all three bullets came from the same
() gun? A freak of nature may have actually caused the lodging of the
\ third bullet to prolong the Senators life, thru reducing the loss of
blood from the brain.

A stethascope is very often unreliable, and one inexperienced in the
use of it might not be able to distinguish the punding of their own
heart from, the heart beat of another person. (Thru personal exper~
dence I am aware that the absence of a pulse need not indicate the
absence of life, and this is true of a cerebral vascualr injury or
stroke. I sometimes suffer from postural hypotension in which there
is no pulse on my left side when in a horizontal position)

If it is true that only half of the Senators head was shaved then
there was no surgery possible, only an autopsy. Surgeons would not
accept the responsibility of a marls life without the right to do it
right.

i


--- Page 10 ---
Honorab le @. Mitchell Page 2 @ OR Se PRT,

Why have the doctors that performed the autopsy had a court order
or restraint placed upon them to prevent them from divulging facts?
Were these men called and given the opportunity to testify to all

the facts or was there an evasion of the truth (deliberate)

Why was there so much emphasis on the search foo the polka dot girl
suddenly called off? There are very few psychiatrists that are
qualified to make an objective examination with the ability to be im.
personal in their analysis. Very few of them are interested in learn--
ing how in Calif. They have no need to be, their opinions are

being accepted as facts. This is being permitted by the judiciary
branch in spite of an extensive three years of study into the Dilemma
of Mental Health Commitments in California (at a great expense to the
tax payers). This confirmed that 91% of the patients in California
Mental Hospitals do not belong there. The Subcommittee s survey of
Californi a commitment hearings in this found the average length of

the time alloted to a hearing was 4.7 minutes. One third of them

took less than two minutes. Two minutes to impose a life time

sentence for the majority. Any one may file a petition of mental
illnessmerely by going to the office of the District Attorney ov° —

the Mental Health Counselor. Evidence also revealed that the commitment
becomes automatic that the hearing is ceremonial rather than functional.
In Los Angeles County the person alleged to be insane is not even inter--
viewed by either the D.A. or Mental Health Counselor, In San Francisco
County geriatric screening reveals that most petitions that are filed
are nothing more than Family feuds.

Nowhere in the United States is there a greater display of mental
incompetence of public officials, judges, attorneys and medics than
there is in the State of California. This began with the Brown
administration (to my personal knowledge) and the corruption has in-
creased with each election.) It actually started to my knowledge in
Whittier, the former home town of the President of the U.S.A. It
has been a bitter reality for many years that the parents, the police
department were helpless against the failure to act judicially in

the involvement of the narcotics traffic. This has increased the
narcotics traffic and includes doctors, pharmacies and dentists who

actually are promoting narcotics. They are subject to no authority
outside of themselves, and in this there is no self discipline. Nor

do they attempt to recommend legislation that would make some form of
restrictions on the unethical doctors among them, The San Gabriel
Valley doctors, dentists and druggist Assoc. was formed because the
doctors resented the idea of having to fill out a triplicate for perco-
dan when it was proved to be a dangerous narcotic. One patient became
addicted thru its use for a broken arm. (As a former medical secretary
I was aware of how some doctors were promoting narcotics, and how narcotics
addiction was being promoted by Mil-Mor Foundation.) This in itself
would have made me a threat to the medical professional pride.

I was also one of those that had what was tantamount to a death sentence
to hide a failure to utilize diagnostic equipment, and to gain control
of an estate. This was another reality that the officials would not
wish to be exposed. I was also a great admirer of Mr. Nixon, and con=
sidered him to be more of a statesman than a mere politician, one that
was symbolic of the true Christian ideals for which this country was
founded, and representative of an era that we needed to be returned to,
when the average small town boy could grow up and become the President
a position he might earn himself without the backing of great wealth.

I also wrote a manuscript entitled Human Dignity a copy of which was
sent to the American Medical Association in which I used Dr. Douglas D,

Me Kinnon as an example of an ideal doctor of medicine, one that practiced

preventive medicine and made use of the diagnostic equipment that is
essential today, for even a simple appendctomy has need of specific
scientific tests. This apparently created envy among those who have not
achieved this stature through dedication to humanity, and the relief of
human suffering. Those would be the ones that are dedicated to the
profession of medicine itself and thus to their own positions as doctors
of medicine. The former are never worried or concerned by mal-practice
suits, to the latter it is a major concern.

One of the most eminent brain specialists is now in England conducting
his research althougjhe is an American, Dr. Grey Walter, but apparently
the doctors here do not use his findings. It is possible to use an EEG
and discern whether one has a dominant audio or visual learning ability.
If one is of the latter to depress the cerebral cortex is to depress the
learning ability, but so too has it proved that barbituates and sedatives
diminish the visual reflexes. To diminish the ability to learn. The

eyes of Sirhan in the pictures especially those taken afterwards have

revealed an absence of reaction to light. This is the first test a
doctor makes when an unconscious patient is brought in or a coma, to see
if there has been brain damage. There was even admission that Sirhan
had suffered a brain injury, were there any EEGs made? Were there x-rays
taken, Were there any indications of his having been given electro-

shock therapy? Were any tests made to see if he were under the influence
of a hypnotic drug? H e was said to be requesting sleeping pills, but
these are mostly hypnotic drugs even aspirin is known to have a mild

hypnotic effect. These hypnotic drugs produce a state of automatism

in_ which the behaviour is automatic Stthout conscious purpose or knowledge.
The subject appears normalto an observer but the xeal personality is
latent, such a person is not responsible for his acts and must be

watched very carefully. He may carry our complicated acts without any
idea of them or any aftermemory. (Taber s Cyclopedic Dictionary.) Post
hypnotic suggestions are transmitted during the hypnotic state to be

carried out later. Sirhan testified that he had no memory of having

killed the Senator.

I wrote an article entitled Paths Of Glory meant to depcit the common
problems that war, assasinations bring to all women especially, no matter
what there party, race, creed, or color. To portray its futility and
absence ofbeing united with a common bond of love and understanding that
none_ever occupy a position so high that they are above being vulnerable

to such incidents , but in it I also revealed the probability that Sirhan
Sirhan was not the one that fired the fatal bullet, but this I did not
realize until it was too late one of the copies had been stolen from my
room. I sent a registered letter to the District Attorney on June 17, 1968
and told him of this and ask him to try to secure it back, that it would have
been Millie Morrison of Mil-Mor Foundation or her directions. I also

went to the office of Joseph Carr the Chief Investigator, but was refused
the opportunity to even talk to him by his secretary Miss Day. June 17,

I recongized the inadvisability of returning to my former room and checked
in the Hollywood Plaza Hotel, although I had no luggage and a broken toe.
It while I was there that I had an attack of tachycardia, these I have
learned to live with, but I also recognized the danger of being found un-
conscious so I explained that I had a heart condition and requested that
Dr. Ralph Coldman of the Good Samaritan Hospital be notified in any

emergency arose and also gave them the name of my brother Col. E.E.
Curran as being with the North American Air Defense. I rented an
apartment at the Wilshire Towers or was going to, but would not have
signed the lease because it was drawn up in the name of Patricia Ann
Tierney and not as the receipt or my legal name as requested, but by
then I also recognized the type of security that was given there would not
be beneficial to me, but quite the contrary, a camera on each of three

, levels for the subteranian garage made it obvious one could ihe made to

‘’door was locked and it was not even dark, nor would my key unlock it.

I received a refund, checked my luggage, and tried to find an apartment
on Wilshire near a bus, and near the stenotype school I hoped to enroll in.
I rented one at the Talmadge an exclusing hotel type apartment, but mine
was one on the roof usually reserved for employees on 24 hour call. It
had just been newly carpeted and the footsteps showed whenever any one
entered during my absence, which was every time I left. I changed the
locks on the brief case I had in order that one that might work the day
before would not or used a chain to fasten it in among my clothes, I
made it as difficult as possible for any one to enter and remove any papers
I had that I might need. I also sent a registered letter to Mr. Joseph
Carr to inform him where I was. I had previously placed in a safe deposit
vault at the Union Bank duplications that included evidence of the failure
of many public officials to render me assistance in protecting my life
my property rights and my right and ability to receive mail (The latter
Ie-still being interfered with); T had written to the Regional Vice
President or Director, Edwin Zeigler, on June 14, 1968 and again on June
17, 1968 to request assistance in protecting my bank account and to show
there had been no true balance of the account because of the absence of
checks. I have made many attempts to secure an accounting, but they
have denied me this right. I still have money in the Union Bank a total
of $675.00 if every check I wrote want thru, but I doubt if they did.
This figure of $675.00 was by coincidence the amount that was said to
have been ail the money or support I had a right to, but I specified on
the back of the check and had photocopies made with and without the
endorsement, this enabled me to have a witness to the signature a Mise

py Rose Mary Davidson of the Americah Heritage Bank in Colorado Springs.
This is the only money 1 have received other than the money I earned in

t yl A New York, the failure of the New York Labor board to collect the shortages

each week from my check forced me to seek assistance from Waverly Center
in New York for one week prior to receiving the $82.40 that was supposed
to have paid my train fare to Los Angeles, although I intended stopping

here, They had previously informed me that I would be allowed $130.00.
My disability check was held at the Law firm of Murge, Rose,Guthrie,

I had previously inquired at Marble Collegiate Church where my mail was
being forwarded when I firat went to New York, (with their permission) and
had received the previous check there forwarded from Colorado Springs,

Box 2249), I was told by a gentlman there that a check had come to me
but he did not know where it was. This information disturbed the janitor
especially when he also infommed me that a large amount of mail had been
received for me there (This I did not receive)

General Manager of the UPI in South America and during that time he had *
his headquarters in Argentina. He was also at one time offered the Post
of Ambassador to Argentina during the Perrone Regime, but declined. He
later was transferred to London, England and was General Manager of the
UPI European Division, and later their Consultant.- Alexander Wolinaw
was of Russian-French parentage, a member of the A,gentine Syndicate,

a former importer according to him, but he also resembled some one that
often took the part of a sadistic european, prussian military role in
movies where Americans were being prtrayed as being tortured, He was

lashes etcetera] could have been very easily disguised as a girl in
polka dots especially in the evening in dim lights. (He also answered

told I had to stay another month, I refused and packed up instead. I went
to the Family Service Association and Captain Latros assisted me in
securing a taxicab, the cab driver was a negro, but he rendered me a
service many white men would not have, and somehad even refused. It

was with his assistance that of two of the hotel employees that I wes
moved out everyting in the cab. We made two trips, and one of the
employees warned me not to return alone by the way he turned the lock.
The cab driver returned with me and waited until If finished picking up
the odds and ends. He even moved my stereo which was apartment size

and these were at first put in the hotel room of the YWCA, and later
entrusted to the keeping of Mr. Scotty, the Bell Captain at the Hayward
Hotel, this included the stereo that I believed may have ben tampered
with. I later moved into the Evangeline Residence but was told the

day I moved in after i paid two weeks rent that two weeks would be all

I would be permitted if I were not working, This enabled them to use

my name & my cousins or his daughters who was married and residing in

Argantina to transport dope etcetera thru unsealed air freight.

I planned on leaving Calif. prior to Mr. Nixon's arrival to begin his
if campaign tour, however I left even earlier when I learned of the death
! and circumstances of it of Dr. Louis R. Nash. I went down and purchased

J a ticket for the first train out of town. I recognized the importance

of having Mr. Nixon becoming elected. I also recognized that it would be
Zi too easy for his political enemies to shoot him and place a gun in my hand
‘ if I were any where in the area in which he was and the possibility of
many being willing to tt perjury to accomplish this.

I stopped in Ogden, because I would have preferred to remain in a small
town where it was easier for me to get around, but when I went to see

Jim Whetton, he informed me that he did not need any more girls, although

I had not asked him for any position. I said I wished to take acourse in
stenotype and try to do some creative writing that apparently my previous
efforts were considered to be quite valuable. I also warned him about

the Argentine Syndicate taking over control in So. Calif. and pointed out
the clean cut young men and women here and hoped they would keep it that
way but he informed me that they too had changed the streets as they had in
Whittier by changing street signs. He was fully aware that I had a letter
from Mr. Nixon with me, and that Clinton Harris had refised te render me any
assistance either in contacting legal assistance, Mr. Nixon or securing my
Workman s Compensation, Jim acknowledged that I should be receiving it,
but made no offer to assist, nor did I ask him te although he witnessed
the concussion, he had left Whittier prior to the time the blood tumor
formed and ruptured./iiA I signed a form to protect any future claims but
did not press it at that time.) I had mailed him copies of the

letter and explanatione of it from Colorado Springs as well as the warning
of the dangers of sabotage against many companies here in Ogden, including

expansion of Holifield s congressional territory, fortunately there were
others that were informed that wereintelligent enough to act constructively.

He saw me but refused to recognize me, the second time I went to his Agency,
I had called the day after my arrival to tell him I had taken the liberty
of giving his agency as an address but these were replies for three tele-
grams sent from Chicago. Senator Dirksen, Harry Fleming and the N.Y. Labor
Board. I did not receive my disability check until the llth making it
necessary to go to the Weber County Welfare for Temporary assistance.

Ihave since requested an inquiry be made into the possibility of there

being duplications in Soc. Security checks in variations of my name being

sent out, I have received no reply , nor to any of the mail sent out,

I was notified that the letter sent to me by the Dept. of Rehab. was

ygturned although the street of Orchard is only two blocks long a 2500 and
2600 block, the local carrier would have had to be informed that a

correction had been made on the box application prior to being approved.

In Washington last Septmeber, I came out of my room to see three policemen
standing by either room 611 or 610 and when the elevator arrived there was
a basket in it to take a body to the morgue. As I looked at it I realized

my

gaerr

it was just my size. I sent many telegrams, and did receive a very important

reply from Camarillo confirming that none had guardianship rights or that
there had never been a declaration of mental incompetence.

I had not written any checks because of the lack of cooperation from the
Union Bank, instead I requested a transfer of funds thru two Washington
Banks, these claimed I had no funds. The checks that I had written for
my hotel bill at the Bellevue, were where I was actually staying. These
were the canceled checks that were returned stamped insufficient funds
using the bank # 16/77 one The Talmadge had used for a check number, I
Was threatened with arrest unless these were made good. My brother Col,
Curran was permitted to send me $250.00 to go to Colorado Springs. I
recognized what I was up against the first time I walked into the Main

Post Office and saw the name of Congressman Evans onthe Directory and
f wondered if he were related to the Thomas Evans that had previously inter~
| ferred with my mail. He was also director of the United Citizens for

Nixon at the Willard Hotel, but what became of the campaign funds???

none were spent in Colorado Springs. I had the only bumper stickers

in town, these I placed on my motel windows, and I also had the only
Nixon lapel pin although there were many for Evans & Humphreys. Reagan
made a pitch for a local Senator & Congressman both of whom were defeated
at a so called campaign fund dinner, but none for Mr. Nixon.

After the massacre on the Campus in Texas, I sent in evidence of the

lack of competent medical attention to the young man that went beserk,

I recognized the dangers of the power of suggestion being misused and
even prior to the manuscript The Secret Weapon of the Communist did
send to Gow, Reagan thru Max Rafferty this evidence in order that no
such incidence might occur in a Calif. Campus due to the use of hypnotic
drugs that coud be used without the victim being aware of it. This too
was included in the material sent to Johnson, the A.M.A Senator Dirksen,
Columbia University (Dr. Margaret Mead) Bishp Sheen and a redemptorist
priest Philip Aggeler. in which I reported Joseph Veich of Whittier,

as one that both the archdiocese of L.A. and the ELA Medical Assoc. did
not believe had the true credentials of a psychiatrist. I stated that

in a safe deposit box at the United California Bank in Whittier, there
were duplications that I decline to state where they went or how. There
were also duplications that were placed in the Union Bank at 8th & Hill

in Los Angeles, that I opened up on June 4th election day the Calif,
primary. I had an affidavit drawn up at the Wilshire Western Brandh

of the Union Bank, giving Mr. Nixon personally the right to acess to
either box and that he was the only attorney that did have, and that

my cousin Thomas R, Curran had rights of coownership, but TI had not

been able to sign a card for him and did not trust the mails. I also

had an affidavit that stated that I had one charge account at J.W. Robinsons
that I was not using that I had no hidden assest in any bank vault,

these originals were left in the deposit box at Wilshire & Western. I
recognized the technicalities that might cause some to declare them invalid
or misinterpret them, so, I had another one notarized on July 19 to replace
the one on July 12, 1968 that gave the same authority but specified

the relative attorneys Curran & Lawton were nof legally empowered to enter.
Mr. Nixon & Mr. T.R. Curran were the only ones to ever be given any legal
authorization to make decisions in regard to the sale or publication of
any of the manuscripts including the comparative analysis of the brain,
the mind and a tlevision. The first one was written in 1964, in non-
technical lagnuage and intended $t demonstrate the indiscriminate viewing
of television, but also a demonstration of the thinking that Dr. Dapiel¢
Block had described as paranoid. and unrealistic. A copy of Human ignity
was sent to Holifield four days after the others, my intution had téld me
to have the others arrive first, but I could give no logical reason for
the delay at that time. In a letter to him (copies had previously gone

the administration of electro shock therapy to reduce a woman to the level

even their natural intelligence now, and in the desparation they hoped to
drive me to, they see but a reflection of their own. These men that sought

to control the thinking of others in order to rule the world have learned
that another human being may thru hypnosis or shock therapy control only
an empty shell, an empty body devoid of a personality, a human soul. Those
who failed their responsibilities, no matter how high or low as employers
as elected or apponted govt. officials, failed themselves and their own
personal families most of all. They have dishnonered their community,
their country, the dignity of man. The evidence in the safe deposit

beneath a cross.

Do you know that love makes no sacrifice, love never counts the cost,
love never dies, love regrets that it can not fill all the human needs
of any child, love desires happiness and beauty, but love also recognizes
that love has to be freely given and have no ties to bind, for only then
can the love be completed and fulfilled, love that is said to be an
obligation is noting more than a debt to a lower self an empty ebo, that
takes wht it does not or can not give.

Who was it that failed the young Jordanian national, the Govt. that failed
to adhere to the immigration restrictions_not in denying him access but

by denying that a sponsor can only sign a paper without recognizing the
privilege of helping another partake of a better world. A Govt. that
forgot the dignity of mankind can never be bought for in the Garden of Eden,
there was everything Adam & Eve desired, there every want had been filled
by an Indulgent Loving Father, but the one thing that was missing was the
grace to appreciate the multitiude of blessings, these were taken for
granted, This is the secret of happiness, not in having everything one
could desire but in appreciation of what one has been given. The Father of
Humanity too had an error to correct, the right of sharing in the creating
of a more beautiful Garden of Eden.

A Govt. that forgot to temember the heritage, the ideals for which this
country was founded, the four freedoms, one that forgot that there are

none endowed with high positions that do not bear a corresponding ob-
ligation to act for the good of all, but the one that grew so accustomed

to an economy geared to war & profits forgot the inestimable worth of

every child. These are the human temples, the human hearts. the minds,
that have a need to be filled with creative ideas to construct a brighter
world, it is not in the number one has, but in the quality of the contents
poured into these temples, that draw out the inherent goodness that an
infinite creator has endowed a human heart with the capacity for. Children
are not born with pride and prejudices these are aquired only when one loses
the gift of gratitude, one need not ever possess a world of material things
if one can but possess the ability to see the beauty in all things.

How is it possible for a young Jordanian National to see beauty thru prison
bars, to look out at a country that once held promise and hope ? He stated
that Jesus Christ Himself could not have saved him, but would not this be

a strange remark for one of his nationality or creed/ or is he a Christian.
If Christ could not save him it was because there are no redeemers to be
the instruments of that saving of a human life. This miracle he needs is

a simple but forgotten one of simple justice, investigation, and a fai

trial based on reality, medical evidence and then objective analysis.

There are too many interested in saving their own faces to permit. the

truth to be told, they would rather go on heaping injury to the insults

of the despotic aristocrats that can afford to be wrong because they have
the political power, the wealth to control the destiny of a nation, a
nation that vould rather be able to remain poor in orde& tha they might never
be bought or sold out.

No two humans ever react to the external circumstances of life in an
identical manner. None have yet given an objective analysis of the

young Jordanian without revealing what they expect to find there,

One claimed that he was substituting his own father, but there was never

any personal relationships, therefore this would require a generalization

to be objective, What is every father ideallically the symbol of?? An

invisible, ideal Father that is perfect, but also something enough of

of America, much less the nationals?

The Doctrine of the Indulgences split the Christian world asunder and
this division has increased until nowhere is it more apparent than in
the Church of Rome, for it can no longer claim to be Catholic since it
is no longer universal in its teachings, nor can any other denomination
claim to be without its dissenters. The shepherds of mankind still
quarrel among themselves as to who is right, forgetting that it is what
that matters. The wolves come in and steal the sheep and the young
lambs are still being led to slaughter. This is the curse of the
Church of Rome that has been passed thru too many generations the
demand for being infallible, when the Creator Himself is still seeking
to_perfect His own Creations thru the hands the hearts e human _w:
that are united with His, In a common bond, a common purpose of a world

in which there is peace on Earth for all, One can never give up a human
will, without surrendering it to another human that is also prone to err.

One can never give up the right to make a decision without trying to take
this from another. One can never give to the rich the right to do wrong
or be wrong, one can never make a reparation to the young people of
America for having failed to passé on to them at Teast as much as we were
given, a world in which there was hope for peace and harmony and a hope
or the foretaste of the happiness of heaven while still here on earth.
Who paid the farmers not te work, who dumped the vitamins of health and
strength in the ocean by the carload, while there was still so much

rotating of the crops? Who forgot that to be independent and free and
lead the way, we must also be self sustaining in our farms, our dairye,
our ranches, Who caused the cities to become ghettos, if not those who
advertised the large welfare payments, but failed to inform them of the
rest of the truth, that a Dollar in New York, or any big city does not
go as far or buy as much as in a small community. Do we not have many
ghost towns thatonce had utilities in many with durable constructions of
an era that built a home to endure that could be reclaimed. Do we not
endanger our industires by having them so close to a shore, it may
save on transportation, but does it not double the risks of defeat and

invasion by failing to support the railroad in times of peace so they
will be there in times of need? (Did the railroads or unions either one

secure unemployment benefits for railroad employes under the Soc. Sec. Act)

There will always be times of indpities that will require changes and
rearrangements, but there will never come a time when any nation, will
ever be without the need to participate and be a vital part of the world

If the young Jordanian National did not kill Senator Kennedy, who

did? Who actually did the killing and who planned it and why?277?

Who would have gained ? It happened in California where A governor

and an attorney General of the State knowingly tolerated the imprison-
ment of many to bury the diagnostic failures of medics (failure to

try to make a diagnosis) but this too was the real crime on the Campus
in Texas failure to make use of the diagnositic equipment that research
has brought about,and a Govt. that failed to take proper disciplinary
measures then, One medic that is undisciplined creates an epidemic of
them, but so too was there another pseudo-psychiatrist that was seek-
ing to destroy the minds and hearts of the people in the Whittier

area. ose who were aware of this failed in their responsibility

to themselves, their professions, their own families, the community,
and the nation. Caution among the undisciplined was not even nec-~
essary for they had learned that the Govt. officials at that time would help
them and tolerate their owm incompetence. Failure to use their talents
for the benefit of their fellowman, This is how they repaid their debt
to the country that had made their educations possible, and provided
the funds for the research. The scientific tools they did not need

to use, they forgot that only Ged has the power to see into another
human soul, a human mind, but California was the State that haf denied
the values of human lives, human souls and tolerated the mental competence
of others and blame it or attribute it to those who have no power
politically to help themselves.

Thomas Lynch, the Attny. General, and Reagan were the ones that might
have gained politically by the elimination of one they might have

seen as a threat to the achievement of their political aims, and they
both would have gained had it been possible to implicate Mr. Nixon even

indirectly. Who could have investigated it, who failed to fill the office

of District Attorney, the same one that has been tolerating the lack
of investigation prior to condmni atients to mental instititions in
order that the politically powerful might steal their estates, but then
he too had failed to make restitution in correcting this or preventing
its reoccurrence when he had the opportunity to do so.e He failed to

face up to his responsibility to the people themselves when he received
a copy of Paths of Glory that inadvertently told him the truth. Instead
time and energy was expended to remder me helpless, in order to be able
to secure the evidence of bis own failure to do so. A false felony
charge might have enabled him to have a warrant to secure the evidence

of the office of the District Attorney tofail to have the mental competence
to distinguish between a civil suit and a criminal offense, but there
was a chance that it might be attributed to Mr. Nixon instead of to

him, but in this too he failed so while they were keeping me from

having any assistance the mushroom of evil grew, They hoped I might
despair of finding assistance, but then they forgot that I was aware

that my sons world his future, his happiness could never be purchased

at the price of ariother and while they sought to discourage me, the

evil still grew and reached epidemic proportions.

I was the mother that tried to instill in my son a respect for authority,
but discovered one day, there was no authority left to respect because
none had the courage to administer it with justice. I once tried to in-
still in my son a reverence for human lives, but one day discovered that
the State of California tolerates the willful destruction of a mothers

a chattel to be destroyed if one could profit. My personal hope became
the el€tion of Mr. Nixon, not that he might render me personal assistance

If one were to analyze the analysts opinions LS ore hight come .
to the conclusion that men who fail to use the power of their position
for the benefit of the majority are the same ones that fear losing those
positions, and this is the fear of failure when in reality the failure
was that of the willingness to try, to seek to inflate their own eZOS,
by deflating those who oppose them, but an ego can be deflated but a
pergon can not, and the envious greedy men who sought to destroy Mre
Nixon politically failed because Mr. Nixon was on Gods side, they
were not. Mr. Nixon represented freedom and justice for all, they
epresented the freedom to do as they leased. When one seeks to
take away an intangible, they mistakenly seek to take away the out-
ward manifestations of the hidden value. Character, backbone, moral
courage that has been earned by effort and thru the right use o
_ personal talents can not be destroyed. I saw its beginning in Whittier,
in which men resented the lack of political coat tails for them to ride
on, so they went over to his opposition. Holifield.eee...They did not
expect Mr. Nixon to win but then neither did they care if he did, for
another Republican came along that was more to their personal taste of
rendering them assistance in cheating their employees, in placing the
burdens of taxation on the populace. (Gov. Regan?’s property holding
are so extensive, he resents the taxes he personally must pay, he
has managed to have them reduced each year thru political connections
but the Domocratic Central Committee chairman was a woman by the
name of Watson. Was she the wife of the tax assessor?) Is Regan a
Republican or Democrat, it is difficult to tell for both parties have
the subversive element in them and he has only been carrying on the

How many young men would have the capacity for intuitively recognizing
that seven people can not be injured with only one gun. Who were the
real perpetrators, who actually did the killing? Who had the opportunit
to take the gun from Sirhan and in the heat or wave of confusion exchange
it? Who was it there to motivate the young Jordanian that probably ha
his omm personality rendered dormant and helpless, was this Alexander
Wolinaw, he told me in a phone conversation that he had killed Robert
Kennedy, but he may have done so expecting me to tell this to the Dua,
fle Had“the opportunity to stéal a copy of BENS 6 Ory an may have
expected me to become involved, giving them the opportunity to silence me.
I had learned there was no authority that functioned for the benefit

of the tax payers, it was being used to hide the scandals of the higher
echelons of our society. This too gave many the opportunity to steal

the manuscripts they wished credit for without earning it.As long as

they could keep me helpless, they had a chance to steal these.

The Redmptorists that might have were subject to the will of a Cardinal
who could not afford a scandal. One of the non-profit charitable organ-—
izations (so-called) was Mil-Mor Foundation, it was a state supported
alchoholic Rehabilitation center that in reality was nothing more than

a front for atcha narcotics addiction, Millie Morrison was the director
and female Christian anarchist that ruled by threat of expulsion, I only
talked to her once and she stated that she would throw any one out that
voted for Richard Nixon. (Chances are those who did vote, did so but
quietly to be able to defy her inwardly if not openly)

The men in the armed forces too would have the intuitive ability to

recognize that more than one gun would have had to be used, the doctors
with knowledge of the function of the brain, the notable absence oh
information that was silenced by a court order. We have lost our respec
as a nation because we lost respect for those who occupied positions oO

trust, and if we have no self respect as a nation, then neither can we
a

expect other nations to respect us.

Is there not the possibility of a previous injury from the rock the
Senator was struck with? a factor that might have healed itself in
time or formed a tumor? I never heard Senator Kennedy speak prior

to his death, only the commercials, and in these I noticed that he
sounded very much like his brother, but there was something missing
in these because there was a flatness about the voice, this is one of
the effects of injury to the frottal lobe, it is called emotionally
flat, but its effect is the loss of the tmability, to transmit ideas
or meanings that correspond to the words. Is there not scientificr
equipment that can test the pitches of the voice to identify them

A man that was informed that he had terminal cancer such as Jack Ruby

was the same one that became vicitmized by a repetiton of the lack
of justice, the lack of respect for the rights of the people to

determine their own choice at the Ballot box.

The enactment of gun control laws will not eliminate assasinations,
nor will it appease the people. One must first find the cause to

be able to effect the cure. Could it be a failure to give a healthy

respect to the young for the right use of these. But then we have
become a nation that has not the ability to use the other material
things for their specific purposes such as ecientific equipment to
make a diagnosis. The legal minds no longer need use their acquired
knowledge in a court of law, they do as they please by pleasing the
party in power. As a nation we do not make use of these material
blessings for the purposes for which the Divine Creator intended them
to be used, Instead there is a loss of the sense of values in the
things themselves so it is now quanityk instead of quality.

A long time ago, at the first outbreak of violence that I remember,
at a Southern California School, it was one that was pro-Cuban, there
was also the wife of a doctor from the Good Samaritan Hospital that
spoke to the Mothers of St. Marys Parish School. She warned us of
these things that have come to pass. The main point I received was
that it would take a strong faith, to counteract these dangers.

Tr T recognized she was telling the truth and this I wanted for inted for my some _

Faith in an | invisible God yisible God, to S “sustain him in times of danger or times’
of need. Some seem to take it for granted that membership to a church

or specific religion is the same as having faith.

A religion that exists only in words is an untried, impractical theory
and therefore to have a proven value the words must have a practical
application thru the every day living of them. These acquire a value

but only to those that choose to live them and then only in the measure
they have been lived. This is what transforms a religion into a living
faith, but its value is only to the person that lived them and Catholic,
Protestant or Jew need only live according to their own. The Church of
Rome can never prove its infallibility by proving every other one is wrong
for science has too often proved the fallibility of their decisions. One
can never find security in membership in any organization, specific creed
or association because this too can be lost or proved to be of no value.

I placed a petition on the Altar of Perpetual Help, for I recognized if
my own son needed a Guiding Star then too so teo did the other children.
I had always requested the Source of Perpetual Help to Mothers to render
me assistance in guiding him, and if it was not possible for me to be
the one to recognize his needs and fill them to please let there be some
one else to do it for me. I can not give my son respect for authority

» for this is something I once had but lost, but we now have a President
that can with God/s help and enough of thase who care to follow him to
restore the administration of authority to function for the benefit of

all.

fe can not do it alone, for society is much to compez. When menx

fight just battles, they find Cod on their side, when men protect the

rights of the weak, the helpless, they do not fear their own human

frailties, When men give themselves the right to examine the con-

eciences of others, they reveal their own, When men expect to find

evil in another, that is what they too will find, but how can they know

or be sure that it is not just the evil of their own thinking them to be.

The ability to utilize the intelligence is something that is very

personal, it is not dependent on how much one knows, or how many

degrees one has, nor is it a possession. It is an ability and must

be used, One need not possess great talents, but in Biblical times

talents were a medium of exchange, coins. Talents ta?can be personal

abilities including? HE uired knowledge. In the parable of the talents,

There were two servants that were rewarded for the manner in which they

used their talents, One invested his wisely and earned an increase for

the Master, one tried but failed, he too was rewarded for his efforts

if not his successes. It was the one that buried his for fear of losing

them that was rebuked by the master.

I was the Catholic that voted for Mre Nixon in 1960 because I sincerely
helieved that he more truly personified the true ideals of Christianity.
i did not hesitate to say so. This wor an unpopularity contest among

the elite.

In 1968, I was the Protestant that voted for Mr. Nixon, I became a pro-

testant for the same reason millions of others have since Martin Luther.

T do not believe one can ever repair a wrong by a contribution of alms

to an institution. In civic circles this is called bribery, by buying
political favors. it just so happens that I did not ever see it the way
others have been taught, but then I learned my catechism lessons from

a mother who saw to it that I returned the pennies that I stole, before

I said the words . It was in this way I learned not to steal pennies

from another. A reparation must, match the act, the sin of detraction

calls for a retraction. Gossipris never considered a serious offense

but in reality £t is gossip that is damaging to the reputation of others,
and how many of the psychiatrists comprehend the psychiatric truth, The
hidden guilt we see in another is but a reflection of our own. If it is
hidden then would not the speaker have to be aware of it, and who is it
that sees the anxiety neurosis of the American people as a sense of hidden
guilt. The medical profession that looked away from its onm sins (ignonance)
have placed themselves in the position of being guilty of being the mill
stones around the necks of their filow members, The attorneys that use
their talents to gossip about the ones that use the gift of tongues to
defend freedom, The judges that make decisions on precedents, or an
opinion another judge once rendered or the social position of the defendant.

What was it that my mother saw when you took
witness an A-Bomb test outside
death and did you real.

My brother was an air force attache in Damascus at that time, there was
nothing phenomenal about my believing that he should be notified prior to
any deeisions setfing a time for the funeral, I simply believed he would
return 1£ possible and this he did. This is what ono might have referred

to as a family association since my brother loved my mother and did not haye
the opportunity to see her prior to his departure for Damascus, Syria, and x
Jordan,

Ay ently there must have been a skeleton in the closet at ‘ation
t wished to hide. All I did was the accounts receivable was required to keep
aa coe edn. this I did by a trial run on the ledger every 10 days.

However, there were other restrictions that were part of thie job too, such as
seeing that there was a purchase order for every invoice for the precision
instruments that went to Caracas & Arabia. Thie was essential to protect both
Magna Corporation and the customers such as Easo International. With the
proper invoices and purchase orders the overseas shipments were the respon-
sibility of the purchaser when they arrived at their destination. American
goods being used by American Companies. (This would prevent them from being
used by the wrong people)

We were shown what was supposed to be classified information about the saline
water project. I saw nothing of interest or value in the film and wondered why
they were showing thie to the office help, It was a film but left no impression
on me because it wae of not interest to me. Was this an attempt to use film and
and subliminal perception??2772772iMy brother was in Caracas during the time I
worked at Magna (He had Been given training for a position here in Ogden...Were
you instrumental in having this altered to an assignment at Heracas?) I doubt
1£ he aven knew I worked there until recently. (Ne precision instruments were
shipped there without purchase orders either when I did the accounts) I wae not
even corresponding with my brother then, possibly the results of the electro
shock therapy I had in 1956 that did not destroy my ability to think, to make
decisions, but broke the bond of familial relationships. I did not sec my
brother again until May of 1966.

Are you aware by now that electro shock therapy effects can not be predetermined,
ner can one be hypnotized that would not be willing to, nor would one act according
to a previous concept of morality Gwillingly accepted) One may be conecientédua
without being inhibited. My brother entered the Air Force in 1940, he wae a good
soldier and was promoted rapidly after he received his wings. Hie character and
personality were carefully molded by ny mother, in spite of hardships, you soe we
wore not unwanted, unloved children, and we never had to bear a sense of guilt at
being a burden to her for she did not see us that way herself. To my mother we
wore a eacrdd trust, it was her role to give us guidance and direction, but never @
domination. We were permitted to make our own decisions, to have a free will of

_ too exhausting and repeated my request for. stenotype training thru La Salle

I applied for stenatype in Washington D.C. but wae n0€ there pig enough to be
refused. In Colorado: Springs, I was told that in 1967 their allotment had been
: used up by March, and no funds would be available until January, but I left .
4 Colorado Springs on January 8, 1969. The Rehab. here in Ogden could not secure 4
_ my records until the end of the period indicating a check is being paid to some ,
one in my name, There was a stenotype studio there that was supposed to be a4
school, but aleo a correspondence course, I tried repeatedly to find some one
there to enroll and pay my own way whiFin Colorado Springs, but none were ever
there. n HOw many times have funds been granted and approved but never given to
me and who would be cashing the checks?

been? How can you protect them from the crimes of the enemies of humanity that

nor would you permit me to reach any that would render me assistance in providing
the evidence of how it was being done. These are crimes that are on your soul not on

Who placed Clinton Harris in a position in which he needed to sell his ranch,

appear that it was a political token, but it just so that I did the
DMV according to my own judgement, and not as some one expected me to do» His
ranch was in Colorado, is it in the area of the Air Force or part of it? Which
committee would that come under Military operations? Last summer Jim Whetton
had a ranch, Did he sell his thru you, is that why he chose not to recognize me
when I came to Ogden. Apparently some people do not wieh to have honest accountants

Although any General Motors ayatumxsf Dealer that adheres to the General Motors

Without these,firme are very apt to have to dig deep to pay back taxes.

because of the likes of you, but somehow that is when an invisible God sustains us
‘to somehow keet trying, to keep searching for a better way.

Following the year I worked at Magna there was an extensive investigation of
our income tax, Months were spent.in looking for an error and finally the
investigator had to be transferred from the downtown office to Hollywood to
claim we had to pay on the $800.00 we paid a relief driver to take over Stans
route when he was in the Hospital, but we were also told it could be taken to
court to establish a-precedents This became obvious that it.was the Bakery
{that was reaping the benefits of a dual deduction, and the men were paying for
“it. but the bakery: too:auffered a lost cause. In letting the men down, they
let themselves and their own. families down most of all.

Breitman too gave me a fringe benefit of a major but
becatise it would reveal his own incompetence ility as san
‘ employer or doctor, I never received the benefits from $3,000.00)

Clinton Harris too, did not have to assume the responsibility of an employer,

I signed the wortens compensation claims in 1961 to protect any future claims,
this wae paid into a private carrier and I was told the state had no record of
it being turned in, Or did an office manager collect it in my name, as secretary
of hie incorporation, he might not have had much to say about it, if she did.
Hie lip service ae Preaident of the Nixon Committee would not be associated with
you but imputed to Mr. Nixon, ;

The knowledge that we preferred to pay ovx own taxes once, to asking for political
favors apparently gave many former employers or prospective ones the jitters,
Would the FBL be the ones to turn to if one were inclined to be a tax informer.

I recently did seek to: protect. myself from any false charges by informing the
Internal Revenue Service in Washngton that there undobtedly were some claiming
the rights to handle estates for me with the use of an illegal Ictter stating
that I had been declared incompetent, when in reality three attempts to render

me so have failed, and ‘not even a declaration of mental illness was secured.

I am therefore establishing my residence here in Ogden, Utah to protect my life,
my proerty rights, my rights to have medical assistance, legal assistance and
tehabilitation even if I have to. pay fdr.it myself. I had to leave the State

: "and provide me with the neteasary, documénts, The only alt ve woulli be Canadian
citizenship and I doubt if Canada will be any safer from the effects of your
incompetence, avarice, and greed than is the UsS.A.

" % It te mo coincidence is it that the doctors of the Good Samaritan Hospital in
; _ gs Angels, were the same ones that you Lied about and had the medical reporte

DUPLICATE

Dear erat ;
I. sitios edicts 4 me a Lettan from your office dated March 3, 1969

in which I was' advised that the Division of Labor Stahdarde at

80 Centre Street, New York, New York 10013 would be the proper
agency and authority to collect the additional wages due from,
Upiforce Temporary. Employment Agency in New Yori City fof" wages

ed at. Eastern Life Insurance Company, 355 Léxirgton abenae
New York, New York.

A entl “the seued I was referred to is unaware of their fun-

etion, or else the individual that replied was unable to interpret

the written word, since there was not only ample evidence that there
was a rather large sum still due to me for services rendered from
January 17, thru February 14, 1969, but there was also evidence that
the Federal taxes would never be turned in to be credited to

Federal Income Tax Account. withholding for this year, i found it a
atrange coincidence t the Contract Employers using this little illegal
device had the. name.of Uniforce,, since there is also an outfit in.
Whittier, California by. the name of Unitax that pulled the same illegal
device last years {They also advertised their tax returns were figured
by computere but failed to mention that the women auditors were the
computers) They failed to report either my number of exemptions
claimed, or my social Security Account number sfxexeuptions

The absence of the use of a check protector made it obvious that the
figure on the company records might not correspond with the figure on
the check, They used 3 zeros in front of the figure. Aposting machine
may have been used to post their Lake pe making it necessary for the
figure in the hundreds: to. tt inserted correctly in their ‘records, but
the first two zeros were Hfeces }to. line up the third#0. The rate of
pay I received was the lowebt one possible for a file clerk, but I

was working in an Insurance Company where my experience and background
qualified me for every department they had including that of medical
underwriting. I also had a te score on their cash accounting

test.

The uniforce Agency also had two types of paychecks. (regular) and
those they gave out to employees at the office on Friday of the week
they worked. According to this there were dates on the time slips that
were not included on the checks, making it possible to have charged the
clijoany far more than they ever paid me. Each week I informed them
that my check was short, and each week they said turn it in and it will
be included in your next weeks check, but it never was.

The individual that replied to my many inquiries including a telegram
from Chicago, and certified letters apparently is one of those victims

of progressive education where they do not learn to interpret the written
a i ild make it necessary for someone to instruct him very.

agency you recommendéd ‘me to call on Eastern Life Insurance and inquire
how much they paid to Uniforce for my services (Telephone calls and

mail are rather unreliable in New York especially in the business area

see how much théy did deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank for taxes with-

They also refused to make out.my name in the same manner as my Social
Security Account (They eliminated. the middle initial) they also refused
to put either. my permanent home address at that time or my New York
address as you can see by the photocopies of the checks and stubs. There ,
was no means of identification on the stubs, making it necessary for me! oto
to have photecopies of tha chécke and stubs pribr rider si ins.
therefore made it impossible for them'to alter the checks ‘and claim 1

had altered the figure on the check. Chase Manhattan Banks were the only

banks that would cash these checks.

It. is unfortunately true that many companies are using temporary help
to avoid having to-pay the 4% of the Soc. Security, since they do not . |
have to pay this if one is employed for less than 3 months, I also re- ‘
quested that the Agency fee be specified since it would be deductible for |
me if included in my earningss

This may be why the American People have no respect for authority. The

failure of a Labor Board to render assistance in collecting wages enables

employers to take advantage of all loyees, meani there is no author-

ity if it is not exercised for the benefit of the ayerss The amount |
of State and City withholding would indicate the State and City are re- |
ceiving their share of taxes withheld from such paychecks but not the
Federal Governments Especially in a case where the taxes would be turned

into a different internal Revenue Service Center than that of the perm- by

We the American People have had enough of the lack of law, order and
authority'¥unctioning for the benefit of the taxpayers. There will be
a restoration of respect for law’and order when there is a return of it
being administered to benefit the American people as a whole and not

Springsifer example. ‘4

You have inherited the Cabinet Post in which there is more corruption

and graft than in any other department in our Government today. If you are
politically ambitious it would be advisable to start earning your votes

for any future positions you might wish to have. Any failures to correct
that corruption in the Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare will be proved
to be existent with your knowledge and approval and therefore you will not

be in a position to blame either Mr. Nixon, the Postmaster General, or the
Attorney General.

Your failure to take steps to correct this makes it apparent that you too
along with Regan would seek to blame your own incompetence on Mr. Nixon
For, the Social Security Hoax and the Saline Water Frauds, going on thru out
the U. S. A. today.

The enemies of our country have a habit of liquidating those they use to
gain power, when they are thru using theme One man or even two or three
can not accomplish a miracle because miracles have to have some believe
enough in them to strive to make them possible. It has been the denial
of responsibility for many high officials in California that has not only
turned it into a Welfare State but one that is pretty well dominated by
the Communists, who are turning the people and officials into Zombies thru
the use of colored film on black and white programs from Mt. Wilson thru
the pay T.V. set up in the Whittier. area, with the knowledge and approval
of Gov. Regan, and Rasputin Mc Intyre. The vilest suggestions that are
beyond description have been implanted in the minds of the young people
and which of the same officials has the power to protect his own children
or grandchildren from being victimized by this.

Unless the Communists and those who support them without being a party
member by their own evasion of responsibility (on every level of society)
ambitious to take over. ;

¥y

Mr. Nixon was elected as the last hope of the American People for restor-

ation of freedom, justice for all but he can not accomplish it alone. Nor

could General Eisenhower.
