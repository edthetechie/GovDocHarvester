ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Intensive investigation is continuing in order to determine the
complete circumstances surrounding the shooting of Senator Robert F,
Kennedy by an individual who has been charged by Los Angeles,
California, authorities as his assailant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

School records in Pasadena, California, described Sirhan prior
to 1963 when he graduated from John Muir High School as "friendly, co-
operative, well mannered, has adjusted very nicely to his new environ-
ment and making many new friends. "' Continuing investigation into Sirhan's
background indicates, according to his brother Sharif Bishara Sirhan, the
assailant had little association or communication with the rest of the
family. He had few male associates and since his fall from a horse in
September, 1966, had been more withdrawn.
~ The FBI Laboratory has conducted an examination of the hand- ~ - !
writing appearing on papers found after a search of Sirhan's room in the
Pasadena family home which bore notations advocating the overthrow of . |
the President of the United States and other statements alluding to the —
necessity of assassinating Robert F Kennedy. The handwriting could not
be identified as Sirhan's because of the lack of adequate known handwriting
samples. Additional samples of Sirhan's known handwriting are being
obtained for comparison purposes.

A copy of this material is attached.

Investigation is continuing in an effort to account for Sirhan's
activities directly prior to the shooting of Senator Kennedy. Individuals
who were inattecdance at the ballroom in the Ambassador Hotel at the

time of the shooting Two

ing located and interviewed in detail.


--- Page 9 ---
ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY

witnesses, Humphrey Cordero and Enrique Rabago, identified Sirhan as
being at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 9:30 p. m., Pacific
Daylight Time, on June 4, 1968, at which time Sirhan is alleged to have
made derogatory comments regarding "rich people"! in general and
Senator Kennedy in particular. It was alleged Sirhan stated that

Senator Kennedy was going to "buy the presidency" for personal purposes,
and that he (Sirhan) was looked down upon because of his clothing. Both
Cordero and Rabago were of the opinion based on their conversation with
Sirhan that he had come to the Ambassador Hotel alone since no one
appeared to be accompanying him during their approximate ten-minute
conversation with him.

Three of the five individuals who were wounded during the
shooting were interviewed, but none observed the assailant. The remain-
ing two who were more seriously wounded will be interviewed as soon as
their condition permits.

Mayor Samuel W, Yorty, Los Angeles, California, was reported
by the news media on June 6, 1968, as stating Sirhan was associated with
the W, E. B, DuBois Clubs of America. The Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment advised that on January 16, 1966, a vehicle registered to Sirhan's
brother Adel was observed in the vicinity of Baces Hall, Sunset and
Vermont, Los Angeles, California, where a meeting sponsored by the

W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America Was being held. ~

FBI files based on available data failed to establish Sirhan was
a member of such an organization,

A reliable source has indicated that Dorothy Healy, Los Angeles
Communist Party leader, has stated the assassin is unknown as a member
of the W. E, B, DuBois Clubs of America in the Los Angeles area. The
W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America is a Marxist-orientated youth organi-
zation whose leaders in 1967 were Communist Party, United States of
America, members. It was indicated that the Communist Party, United
States of America, intends to issue a press release denying Sirhan has
had any connection with the Communist Party and, in fact, is considering
a legal suit against Mayor Yorty with respect to his allegations.

FROM:Bob Owen

Al Rosen called me and raised certain problems that
he saw, and wanted opinions before they moved. The principal
issue is what the Bureau should do about interviewing the
subject Sirhan Sirhan. The FBI is very clear that they do
not want to be in a position where they have not at least
attempted to interview the subject and, of course, would
like substantively to interview him.

Rosen advised that the police mve advised the Bureau
they have not picked up any information from the subject
and that the prosecuting attorney has directed the police
to attempt no further interviews.

Rosen believes that the Bureau has no problem, both
with respect to the police and to the county attorney of
reaching the subject for interview. He indicates that they

can arrange it without difficulty. ae

& bead = Po oe
The questions he raises and would like jso BERARE WEY Or JUSECS

to are as follows:

1. If he has a lawyer, ACLU lawyer Wir aN 8 1969
issue is ambiguous, then they have no problem- the plan
would simply be they contact the attorney toa permission 2
to interview the subject and the details woulld be guided a
by the attorney's decision, namely whether the Interview
would be recorded and other details of how they set up
the interview; whether the interview would be with or
without the attorney.

2. It is also quite possible that the subject has
no attorney. They are really asking advice on what to do
in this event. Their concern is the Massiah case. While
they do not plan any tricks, their concern is really one of
the stage of the proceeding. They are inclined to believe
that at this juncture they should not interview the man at
all unless he is represented Myf (whether or not the attorney
wants to be present). If he is not represented, Nat's
view of Massiah and the succeeding cases are that basically
at any stage of the proceeding, that if the man is advised
of his right to have a lawyer and an assigned lawyer and ‘
still maintains that he does not want a lawyer then they ar
can proceed to ask him if he would talk to them without, a Ah
lawyer and if he signs the waiver consenting to do so they


--- Page 44 ---
can proceed to interview hin.

Al Rosen had some concern that if the guy does give
the statement because he believes that the statement may
be self-serving. This does not trouble me one way or
another. Rosen's concern I think is that the subject
might be building his case to the law enforcement people
of his incapacity to stand trial.

I think the ticklish provlem presented for the
Bureau is how they satisfy themselves as to whether or not
he is represented now. In the usual case they simply
ask the subject and I am inclined to believe that that
is what they should do here. The other alternative would
be to call the ACLU and determine whether or not they
have gotten a lawyer as yet, thought I think that is
inviting press coverage of the attempted contact of the
FBI of the subject.

I am going to the Hogate Restaurant (638-8066) for
dinner and I will call you from there. Rosen said we
could get back to him tomorrow on this, but if needed
we can deal with him tonight.

NEW YORK (UPI) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy’s name
was injected yesterday in the
Queens conspiracy-to-murder
trial as being on a list of
“people who should be
assassinated.” .

The quote was attributed
to Herman Ferguson, a de-
fendant in the trial, by

| Detective Edward Howlette,

a police undercover agent.

Howelette testified Tuesday

| that ‘President Johnson also

was being considered as a

possible assassination target
by the alleged conspirators.

e Negro detective testi-

) fied that on May 18,1967, he,

Ferguson and Arthur Harris,
the other - defendant, dis-
‘eussed a “list of selective
terrorism.”

Despite defense objections,
Howlette was allowed to enter
names on_ that. list:

Wilkins, Whitney Young, Rdb-
Ell

ert -Kennedy, -Larry
_and Larry Neal."

fication of the last two per
