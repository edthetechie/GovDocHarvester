She took SIRHAN into the lodge room and they sat down
near the front of the lodge on the left side. As the meeting
started he asked who the officers were and whet their positions
were and when the ritual team entered the lodge he asked who
and what the "Colombe" standing by the Schakina (altar) was.
She explained the above to SIRHAN and he seemed very intent
on the ceremonies althougn he did not know how to respond
to various phases of the ceremonies and she had to instruct
him as to the proper signs and responses to make. She recalled
that when a particular prayer was being said,SIRHAN did not
have his hands in the proper position end a woman sitting on
his other side told him the correct way to hold his-hands and
he immediately corrected his hands.

During the meeting, another officer, the Inner Guard,
took up en offering from the members and she recalled that
SIRHAN pl..ced one dollar in the offering.

As the meeting progressed the master, TED STEVENS,
asked for members to volunteer to take part in an experiment
he was going to conduct regarding touch sensations. SIRHAN
asked her why she did not volunteer and she asked him why he
did not volunteer. SIRHAN then stood up and volunteered to
take part and proceeded to the center of the lodge and in
so doing started to cross in front of the Schakina in an
improper manner .- ‘ The master corrected him and
nad SIRHAN approach the center of the lodge from the other
side. SIRHAN was then seated in a chair in the center of the
lodge and was blindfolded. The master then touched his skin
with different number of objects and SIRHAN attempted to
identify the number of objects whicn were placed against
him. Following the experiment SIRHAN took a seat opposite
LUANA on the right side of the lodge where he remained until
the ceremonies were concluded,

After the meeting they adjourned to the refreshment
room where she asked SIRHAN if he would like to have a cup
of coffee with her and the other members to which he responded
"Okay." She excused herself for a moment as she had to take
her mother's purse to her and when she returned SIRHAN was
looking at some of the Rosicrucian books and appeared very
interested in the books. LUANA excused herself again and

went to the restroom and to fix her mother a cup of coffee,
When she returned SIRHAN was standing by the exit of the lodge
and she walked over to him. SIRHAN said he must leave and told
her goodby and that it had been nice meeting her. She told him
goodby and SIRHAN left the lodge. SIRHAN appeared to be in

a hurry to leave and she did not attempt to detain him. She
believed this was about 9:15 p.m.

She recalled that during her conversations with
SIRHAN, he said he lived on East Howard Street in Pasadena
and that he came to the United States from Jerusalem. He
told her he had attended John Muir High School in Pasadena.
SIRHAN asked her how old she was and she told him sha was 14
years old. She recailed that he had difficulty in pronouncing
her name correctly and could hardly say LUANA,.

She described SIRHAN as being 18 years old and being
very neat and clean and stated he was wearing a long sleeved
blue shirt, light blue levi pants and grey "Hush-Puppy" shoes.

She recalled that following SIRHAN's departure from
the May 28, 1968, meeting that one of the lodge officers asked
where SIRHAN had gone as the officer wanted to talk to him,
LUANA told the officer that SIRHAN had left. She is not cer-
tain which officer made the inquiry about SIRHAN.

She stated that tne day after Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY was killed she was watching television at school and
saw SIRHAN's photograph as the alleged killer of Senator
KENNEDY and immediately recognized the photograph as being
identical with the young man she had escorted at the May 28,
1968, meeting. She then telephoned her mother and told her
that SIRHAN had shot Senator KENNEDY.

LUANA was shown a group of photographs consisting
of the following:

EMMA JEAN ACOB, 2090 North Raymond Avenue, Altadena,
California, was contacted at her residence and voluntarily
advised as follows:

She is a member of the Ancient Mystical Order of Rosae
Crucis (AMORC), known as the Rosicrucian Order, and attends meeting
every Tuesday night at the Akhnaton Chapter, 2031 East Villa,
Pasadena, California. She is presently a member of the ritual
team of the chapter which takes part in the ceremonies conducted
during the lodge sessions.

She attended the May 28, 1962 meeting and upon
arriving at the lodge she donned ner robe for the ceremonies .
She was standing outside the lodge room when she observed an
unknown white male start to enter the ritual team's door into
the lodge. She told this man that he should enter the other
door which the members use to enter the lodge. The man then
walked away from tnat door and sne did not see him again until
she entered the lodge as a member of the ritual team. When
she came into the lodge room, she observed that her daughter,
LUANA ACOB, was sitting beside this man. She advised that her
daughter is a "Colombe" (a young female virgin) of the Chapter,
and had been designated to guide and assist this man at the
ceremonies as he was new at the lodge and unaccustomed to the
rituals and procedures of the lodge.

‘She particularly recalls this man because he was much
younger than most of the members present as most of the members
of the lodge are older adults. She thought the man was of
Mexican descent because he had an olive complexion and had
long, black, curly nair and was a clean cut and neatly dressed
individual. She recalled he was wearing a dark sports shirt
and @ pair of slacks. She believed he was about 18 years old
and at the time she thought this might be a good friend for
her daughter as both were members of the Rosicrucians and
both appeared to be close in age.

school stating that the man who had been at the May 28, 1968,
meeting was the man who shot Senator KENNEDY, Mrs. ACOB saw a
picture of the alleged assassin on television and immediately
recognized SIRHAN SIRHAN as being the man her daughter had
escorted at the May 28, 1968 meeting.

VERNA C. MILLER, 4636 Earle, Rosemead, California,
telephone 286-5645, was contacted at her residence and vol-
untarily furnished the following information:

She stated she ig a member of the Ancient Mystical
Order of Rogae Crucis (AMORC) known as the Rosicrucian Order
anc attends meetings every Tuesday night at the Akhnaton Chapter,
2031 East Villa, Pasadena, California. She is a hostess for
the lodge and every Tuesday she stands in che hallway and greets
members as they come in.

She was in attendance during the regular meeting held
on May 28, 1968 and recalls on that particular night she greeted
a young man, who was a stranger, and who had not attended their
meetings previously. After greeting this person she asked his
name and this person gave her an unusual name and because of
the difficulty in pronouncing this name she had him write his
name on his name tag. She recalls that it was SIRHAN. She
also requested this person to sign the guest book. He was
somewhat reluctant to sign it at first but she took him to the
book and told him he nad to sign same and she observed hin
sign this book. Miss MILLER stated this was the first occasion
she had to see this individual and had not seen him come to the
lodge with any other member. Her conversation with SIRHAN was
very limited and consisted of greeting him and then she turned
him over to the “colombe", who guided him and ushered him to
his seat.

Miss MILIER stated that sne recalls,during this meet-
ing san experiment was performed by the Grand Master, Mr. TED
STEVENS, and SIRHAN volunteered to acsist in this experiment.

Miss MILLER stated she did not observe SIRHAN after
tne meeting was concluded and did not see him leave. She
did wonder why this person was there because he was much younger
than most of the members present. She described him as neat
and of foreign descent wearing tight trousers, possibly light
blue with a light shirt and a dark jacket. She stated his hair
was neatly combed and he was extremely well mannered.

Introduction

ririz hieroglyphic inscriptions on the temples of
Fegypt, though in existence for centuries, re-
mained a mystery to modern man until the discovery
and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone, which became
a key to their meaning. The Rosicrucian Order,

-though in active existence for centuries, is also not

known to some persons, institutions, or organiza-
tions as it should be, because of the lack, heretofore,
of a concise work referring to its objects, practices,
and history. A number of recognized literary refer-
ence sources as the encyclopedias refer to the organi-
zation, but they are not always available. Therefore,
this brochure is prepared. It is hoped that it will
also be a key to the solution of any mysteries which
may seem to surround the world-wide activities of
the Rosicrucian Order.

This brochure has been assembled for editors, pub-
lishers, authors, and research workers that they may
have brief, relevant facts pertaining to The Rosi-
crucians. Therefore, all unessential information has
been deleted, leaving elaboration for larger, bound
works.

PART ONE

What Are the Rosicrucians?
Vv

Nature of the Organization

The Rosicrucian Order is, broadly, a world-wide
fraternal organization, established and operating on
a lodge system. It expounds a system of meta-
physical and physical philosophy intended to awaken
the dormant, latent faculties of the individual where-
by he may utilize to a better advantage his natural
talents and lead a happier and raore useful life. It
accomplishes this end by a method of personal in-
struction and guidance. The member is taught the
significance and application of the cosmic and nat-
ural Jaws which are found manifest in the universe
around him and in himself. It unites, into one
livable philosophy, metaphysical idealism and such
practical sciences as physics, chemistry, biology,
physiology, and psychology. It also seeks, by its
educational campaign, to rid society of the enslaving
influence of superstition.

The Order, throughout the world, is divided into
jurisdictions, in each of which there are established
Grand Lodges with temples of instruction, The
Supreme Temple for the international jurisdiction
of The Americas, British Commonwealth, France,
Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Africa is located
_in San Jose, California. (For history, see page 8.)

What Does the Name Mean?

The word “Rosicrucian” is the Anglicized form
of the original Latin name of the Order~Rosac
Crucis, which means of the rosy cross. The name
is derived from the Order’s centuries-old symbol—
the cross and a single red rose. Although the sym-
bol consists of a cross, it has no sectarian or strictly
religious significance, but an allegorical meaning of
its own.

“Rosicrucian” is pronounced: Ro'’zi-kru’shan.

4
\

What Does A.M.O.R.C. Mean?

The initials, A. M. O. R. C., are an abbreviation
of the words, “Ancient Mystical Order Rosae
Crucis,” which is the complete name of the Order
throughout the world. In Latin, the full title of the
Order was originally: Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae
Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. In various lands at vari-
ous times the Order has been known by slightly
different abbreviations of the original Latin title.
In modern times the initials, A.M.O.R.C, usually
follow the popular phrase, “the Rosicrucian Order,”
to designate authenticity.

Is It a Religion?

The Rosicrucian Order is absolutely NOT a
religion. It is nonsectarian in every respect. As its
membership is world-wide, it of course includes
persons of every creed and denomination, as does
any other world-wide fraternity of a cultural nature.
Many leading clergymen of Protestant denomina-
tion, rabbis, and priests are members; but the Order
itself, in the past and at present, is free of religious
alliances. Although its ethics adhere to the principles
of Christianity, it must not be considered a religious
movement or a Christian sect. The teachings do not
interfere with the religious freedom of its members.

Is It a Commercial Enterprise?

The Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC (The
Rosicrucian Order) is incorporated in the State of
California, and its subordinate bodies are incor-
porated elsewhere, as nonprofit corporations. No
funds of the Order inure to the personal benefit of
any officer or member. There are no stockholders
or shareholders, and all funds are held in trust for

purposes as defined by the Constitution and Statutes.

The nonprofit status of the Rosicrucian Order is
recognized by the United States Department of
Internal Revenue, and in similar departments in
other nations. i

What Does It Teach?

An individual listing of the subjects included in
the membership curriculum would be too lengthy
for the space provided here. In main, it includes
such topics as the mysteries of time and space; the
human consciousness; the nature of matter; perfect-
ing the physical body; the effect of light, color, and
sound upon mind and body; the ancient philoso-
phics; development of will; human emotions and in-
stincts, and their relation to personality; important
discoveries in Rosicrucian chemistry and physics;
explanation of the phenomenon of intuition, etc.

The arganization maintains its own editorial and
research departments, composed of men and women
of its membership who have skill and training in
specialized fields of science and literature, as well
as being well versed in Rosicrucian principles. The

instructions are either delivered orally in temples of «

the Order to the members, or sent privately to them
in manuscript form. The subjects are accompanied
by experiments which the member must conduct in
order to remove the material from the realm_ of
theory and make it entirely practical and applicable,
by demonstration, to his personal life. Highly specu-
lative, fantastic, or improbable subject matter is not
included in the teachings of the Rosicrucians.

Who May Become Members?
Any law-abiding citizen of either sex and over

twenty-one years of age, of good repute and having
a firm conviction in a Supreme Being, is eligible

. for membership in the Grand Lodge of the Rosi-

crucian Order regardless of creed or financial status.
Thus, the organization includes in its membership
a cross section of all classes of people. Its mem-
bership includes manual laborers sceking to better
themselves, and also prominent businessmen, direc-
tors of industries, physicians, attorneys, scientists,
artists, editors, educators, and authors, who find the
teachings stimulating and livable.

What Rosicrucians are NOT
. Vv

The Rosicrucian Order (AMORC) IS independ-

ent. It never was aud is not a part of or spensored
- by any other movement or organization, It has

at times during the centuries of its existence entered
into a federation of orders or fraternities of like
nature, but it has never submerged its individuality
or forfeited its independent functioning. Regardless
of the similarity that some persons believe exists
between the honorable Freemasonic Order and the
Rosicrucian Order (AMORC), there is, in fact, no
relationship between the two orders.

The Rosicrucian Order does not teach, endorse,
or practice astrology, fortunetelling, crystal gazing,
or any past or present superstitions, or similar popu-
lar pseudo-scientific practices.

The Order makes no demands upon its members
to conduct themselves in any manner that would
cause public ridicule or condemnation. The members
are not required to dress, eat, or act differently from
any intelligent and morally responsible man or
woman in conducting his or her ordinary affairs. They
resort to no practices or rites which in any sense are
injurious to health, family relationships, or morals.
. No Political Affiliations. The Rosicrucian Order
(AMORC) is nonpolitical, and not aligned or asso-
ciated with any movement, society, or group having
political activities. Political affiliations are consid-
ered to be the prerogative of the individual member
and not a matter for intervention or counsel by
the Order. :

The following, however, is ascertained from each
member who desires affiliation with the Rosicrucian
Order: “Are you doing your best to be a good and
useful citizen and to obey the laws of the country
in which you live?” Also, the Rosicrucian Oath of
Membership has for many years exacted the prom-
ise—“that I will honor and respect the flag of my
country and the country in which I live; that I will
never be guilty of treason; that I will be a good
and useful citizen contributing to the advancement
and welfare of the country in which I enjoy the
privilege of being a resident.”

History of the Rosicrucians
Vv

Traditional History

Traditionally, the Rosicrucian Order traces its
origin to the mystery schools or secret schools of
learning established during the reign of Thutmose
TH, about 1500 B. C., in Egypt. Though he de-
voted himself seriously to an investigation of “the
mysteries’—in other words, natural phenomena—
Thutmose III still clung to the ancient religions of
the period. His descendent, Akhnaton, 1355 B. C.,
known as the heretic king, also became leader of the
mystery schools; but, being extremely progressive,
he abolished the polytheistic religions of the time to
advance in their stead the world’s first doctrine of
monotheism. The Rosicrucians look upon Akhnaton
as their traditional first Grand Master.

From Egypt, the secret teachings of the brother-
hood spread into Greece,-and thence into Romp.
During -the Middle Ages they were concealed under .
various names due to circumstances of the times.

Chronological Records

Chronologically, the Order is mentioned as far
back as A. D. 1115, in a book of the collection of
Brother Omnis Mariar in Germany. It rose to con-
siderable prominence during the Sixteenth Century
when, following the invention of the printing press,
a‘small pamphlet entitled The Fama Fraternitatis
was issued and given wide circulation. The author-
ship of the Fama has often been erroneously at-
tributed to Johann Valentin Andrea (1586-1654).
The pamphlets were part of a campaign for the
revival of the Order. The Order first came to
America in 1694, locating in what is now Fairmount
Park, Philadelphia. :

For a detailed history of the Order, refer to the
fourteenth edition of the Encyclopacdia Britannica;
New Standard Encyclopedia; and Rosicrucian Ques-
tions and Answers with Complete History of the
Order, by Ir. H. Spencer Lewis, available in public
libraries. .

Activities

Rose-Croix University

The Rosicrucian Order maintains, as part of its
cultural program, what is known as the Rose-Croix
University. The University is located in Rosicrucian
Park, San Jose, California. The University is divided
into three distinct colleges: The College of Fine and
Mystic Arts, The College of Mundane and Arcane
Science, and the College of Humanities.

The Rose-Croix University building contains well-

-equipped modern laboratories. The faculty members

have academic degrees from world-recognized uni-
versities in their chosen fields of teaching. Students
from all over the world attend the University’s
special semester. The University is strictly a non-
commercial venture. .

(For picture of the Rose-Croix University build-
ing, see page 22.)

International Board of Leciureship

A trained lecturer, with sound motion-picture
equipment and films and scientific devices to demon-
strate the Order’s teachings, personally visits coun-
tries in which the organization is active. In each
city, lectures and demonstrations are given not only
to the membership of the Order but to the general
public as well, without charge. The lecturer is a
part of the International Board of Lectureship of
the Rosicrucian Order. :

Support of Public Libraries

“ Public libraries in the Americas and many li- :

braries in Europe receive one or more of the large,
bound, Rosicrucian philosophical works gratis. As
readers’ demands increase, additional copies are
sent. without cost to the library. A number of the

books have been translated into several languages,

and Braille. .

Rosicrucian Science Museum
and Planetarium

The Rosicrucian Science Museum, located in the
Planetarium building in Rosicrucian Park, San Jose,
California, and built at considerable cost, includes
a series of exhibits to demonstrate fundamental laws
of the physical sciences. It was one of the first science
museuins of its kind in the western United States.
Here, instruments are arranged’ in order according
“to the spectrim of energy, progressing from the
lower rates of vibration upward in the scale of
manifestation. The visitor presses a button, auto-
matically operating equipment for illustrating the
principle explained on a placard within the case.
A model of sound waves in slow motion, an elec-
tronic picture. of sound vibrations, electric genera-
tion, object suspended in space, mechanical rotation
produced by heat, and the mystery of black light
are only a few of the exhibits in this growing
institution.

The Planetarium building also houses a modern
air-conditioned amphitheater called the “Theater
of the Sky,” portraying the greatest drama of all
the ages. Astronomical mysteries present in the sky
are simply revealed for both young and old. The
building includes a seismograph for recording earth-
quakes, a cosmic ray coincidence counter, a urani-
sphere, and many other scientific instruments.

(For picture of the Rosicrucian Science Museum
and Planetarium, see page 20.)

Egyptian Museum and Art Gallery

The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum is the largest
museum devoted to Egyptian antiquities in western
United -States and is a member of the American
Association of Museums..It contains a collection
of several thousand exhibits from all parts of the
Orient and from interesting centers of ancient
civilizations. The exhibits consist of Egyptian mum-
mies of human beings, animals, and birds; statuary,
jewelry, utensils, clothing, and works of art of van-
ished races. The Museum also contains the only
full-sized exact reproduction of an ancient Egyptian
rock tomb to be seen’ in America—such a tomb as
one sees in the sandstone cliffs on the west bank of

10

the Upper Nile. Its collection has been secured
from leading museums of the world. Models of the
Great Pyramid, King Tutankhamen’s mummy case,
and other objects of historical importance enchant
the visitor. A prominent art gallery in San Jose is
maintained here. Outstanding exhibits are made
available to the public.

Admission to the Museum is FREE to the public
as well as to members of the Rosicrucian Order.
It is visited annually by more than 150,000 persons,
including school and college groups.

(For picture of the Museum, see page 18.)

Statistics

The following statistics are offered to give the
reader some conception of the extent of activity of
the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC):
©G The AMORC mail is one of the largest on the

Pacific Coast—its postage expenditure amounting

to more than $250,000.00 annually.
© More foreign money orders are received by

AMORC monthly than by any other institution

between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
© Over 6,000,000 pieces of literature are mailed to

‘all parts of the world annually by AMORC.
© AMORC maintains the only public, free museums

in San Jose—the Science museum, and the only

strictly Egyptian and Oriental museum on the
- Pacific Coast. A modern art gallery is included.
© At every Rosicrucian Convention nearly all states
in the Union, the provinces of Canada, and
several foreign countries are, represented.

© If all the 7,120,000 sheets of letter-size stationery _

used by AMORC in one year were laid end to
end, they would form a path of paper from
New York City to Kansas City, or 1,236 miles.

© The number of readers of magazines and news-

. papers in which AMORC advertisements appear
monthly is in the tens of millions or exceeds the
entire population of many countries.

© The Reading Mail Department of AMORC reads
7,000,000 words monthly, or the equivalent of
160 standard-sized volumes of 300 pages each,
of approximately 145 words to the page.

PART TWO

The Institution Behind
the Organization

Vv

Integrity

The Rosicrucian Order (AMORC) is proud to
refer inquiries as to its administrative practices to
the San Jose, California, Chamber of Commerce and
The Better Business Bureau of Santa Clara Valley.

The organization in its present form has been
established in the United States and various other
nations for several decades and enjoys an enviable
reputation in whatever community its lodges and
chapters are located. It zealously guards its ancient

landtharks and customs which keep its administra- .

tive conduct above reproach.

Foundation and Stability

The ability of the Rosicrucian Order to make good
on its promises to provide members with certain
study material, and to perform the various services
and provide the facilities held out to them, is pos-
sible because of the institution behind the organi-
zation. It owns the real property upon which its
buildings stand, and there are no outstanding obli-
gations against either its real or its chattel property.
Financially, the Rosicrucian Order is quite capable
of meeting any obligation it assumes.

The following pictures will give the reader a
pictorial representation of the ‘stability of the Rosi-
crucian Order. .

it made him appear to be “like a baby" i* his mother kept such
close contact with him.

She said he once wrote her and gave her his eddress
and asked her to "look after his mail". He enclosed ten
dollars with the letter, but he did not ask her to forward

she received his letter and picked up only one piece of mail
which had come for him,which she believed was a pHampiet Prom

SAIDALLAH BISHARA SIRHAN, 1559 North Lake Avenue,
Apartment 7, adviced that the English translations of the
foreign writing contained in the notebooks of his brother,
SIRHAN B. SIRHAN, appear to him to be just "seribbling". He
said the most he can make out of the writings is that SIRHAN
was just practicing writing words and phrases in Arabic, as
most of the writing does not contain a complete thougnt or
sentence. Many places he just stopped in the middle of a
sentence and repeated a word over and over without ever
finishing the thought. At best, he said he would consider
the Arabic writing as words written at random or just "doodling".

He said, for instance, the word “BASEM" written in
English on item @1-38 means “smiling'’in Arabic. On the same
page are Arabic words "Waheeduddeen" and "Wajieduddien", the
same word spelled two different ways, which means an artist,
such as a musician or singer or great star - a very talented
and prominent performer.

On Q1-33 appears the word "Shener“ in English which
is meaningless to him in the context it appears, unless SIRHAN
yas attempting to write the Arabic work “shenar" (phonetic),
which means “a wild chicken".

He said the Arabic writing on 92-28 are the beginning
words of an Arabic love song and is nothing more than aimless
"doodling".

He said the names “LLeN GRUDER and Kallelien on item
Ql-32, written in Engligh, are meaningless to him, and he has
never heard SIRHAN mention those people. He said also that he
has no idea as to whom the name ROGER or ROGERS refers to.

MUNIR BISHARA SIRHAN was interviewed at his residence,
696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, California.

He entered tne residence toward the end of the inter-
views with his brothers, ADEL and SAIDALLAH, and the material
covered with the latter two was not reviewed with him completely.

MUNIR did, however, review the photographic copies
of Item Q2, a small notebook and stated that page one contains
the names of two attorneys, HOLLOPETER and MARCOS. He advised
that Q2-p3 contains five items which appear to relate to the
time he was arrested for narcotics, for which he is currently
on probation. He stated that Item 1, which says "see Mrs.
Thurber", is probably a notation made by his brother, SIRHAN B.
STRHAN to contact Mrs. LILLY THURBER, who was, during that time,
MUNIR's superior at Nash's Department Store. He stated that
Mrs. THURBER left that store in June, 1967 for a visit to
Holland, but has since returned, and he has no idea as to her
current whereabouts in Pasadena.

He stated that the other four items on that page were
apparently things his brother, SIRHAN, did or intended to do in
the way of helping MUNIR while he was being held in jail.

Q2-p5 contains the notation, "Gilbert VS Hollopeter"
and "Van Downie's testimony". He stated that GILBERT is the
name of a Pasadena Police Officer, HOLLOPETER is a Pasadena
attorney, and VAN DOWNIE is also a Pasadena Police Officer,
but he had no idea as to the significance of these notations
made in the notebook owned by SIRHAN.

Item Q2-p7 contains the name JAMES and the number 64.
He stated that there is a police officer named JAMES, first
name unknown, in the Detective Bureau of the Pasadena Police
Department and this could be a reference to him.

Mr. CLETE ROBERTS, Newscaster and ~- co-owner of
USTV News, Suite 217, 6922 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California, telephone number 469-7789, advised the following:

With respect to the matter of the name CLETE ROBERTS
apvearing in a notebook found among the possessions cf
SIRHAN SIRHAN py the Los Angeles Police Department (APD),
Mr. ROBERTS said that he was aware of this fact.

Mayor SAMUEL YORTY had, in a telecast, mentioned
that CLETE ROBERTS! name had been in a notebook which
. resulted in YORTY being further interviewed at Sacramento,
California, by newsman ROBERT SIMMONS; YORTY being asked
_to further comment on exactly what had appeared in the
notebook with respect to tne name CLETE ROBERTS.

All that Mr. ROBERTS had been able to ascertain
was that his name and some mention of the City of Eilot
had appeared in the book. He mentioned that Eilot, in
Israel, was the sister city of Los Angeles, California.

Mr. ROBERTS said that he had visited the Middle
East on several occasions. In 1/5] and 1456, he had done
television and radio shows in Israel. Previously as a war
correspondent for the American Broadcasting Company in
1945 he had been in this area. ,

Mr. ROBERTS was of the opinion that, the basis for
his name appearing in the notebook in question was a tele-
vision special aired over Columbia Broadcasing System in
this country, which he did on the Middle East war in June,
1967, from Israel. This broadcast had portrayed the position
of Israel in the war with the Arab nations. Mr. ROBERTS
said that he had not been able to get any information from
the Arabian countries which would have stated their paition
in the war. This was in spite of his attempts to interview
certain officials of the Arabian countries involved in the
war at that time.
