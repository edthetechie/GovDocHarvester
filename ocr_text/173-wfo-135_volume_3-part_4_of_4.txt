FRANCES CALLAHAN, secretary, Bakery and
Confectionery Workers International Union of America,
1000 16th Street, N.W., furnished the following
information: ,

Miss CALLAHAN had checked into the Ambassador
Hotel, Los Angeles, California, about noon, June 4,
1968, and stayed at the Hotel two days. She and THELMA
SCHAEFFER were taking an organized tour of the West
Goast. She was in no way connected with the KENNEDY
ca@paign and neither saw KENNEDY nor had any contact
with KENNEDY workers at the Hotel.

Miss CALLAHAN thinks she stayed on the fourth
floor of the Hotel. She spent little time at the
Hotel the afternoon and evening of June 4, 1968. She
returned to her room about 11 p.m., June 4, 1968, and
went to sleep. She did not learn of the assassination
until the following morning.

Miss CALLAHAN recalls seeing no one resembling
the photograph of .SIRHAN SIRHAN at the Hotel.

Mr. DONOVAN said that he did not ever recall hearing
the name SIRHAN and never heard anyone speak of a possible
conspiracy in connection with the shooting of Senator KENNEDY.

and could furnish no information whatsoever regarding the

advised that he was formerly the Postmaster General and
that he was registered at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles,
California, on May 29, 1968, and departed from the hotel and
the city of Los Angeles on May 30, 1968, at which time he
returned to his home in Springfield, Illinois.

Mr. DAY said that he was at the Ambassador Hotel
at the expense of the Kennedy Campaign and was primarily there
for a press conference with Senator TYDINGS of Maryland and
Mrs. MARIETTA TREE, a former member of the Delegation to the
United Nations and a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party.

Mr. DAY stated that the hotel records may have still
had him listed as being registered there on June 4, 1968,
because the room was probably listed in his name, but he,
as he stated above, had left the State of California on May 30,
1968. He said that while in Los Angeles, he heard or knew
nothing of anyone by the name of SIRHAN and could furnish no

JANE KEARNS, residing at 1337 22nd. Street, North West, Wash-
ington, D.C., and employed as a Secretary to the Director, American
Film Institute, 1815 H Street, North West, Washington, D.C., advised
as follows:

She said she was formerly employed as an Assistant to DONALD
WILSON who was in charge of publicity on a nation wide basis in the
campaign of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

She said that she was in the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambass-
ador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, listening to the talk given by
Senator KENNEDY just before he was shot.

She said that she and a number of other campaign workers had
spontaneously formed an aisle or passageway through which they pre-
sumed the Senator would walk through on his way out of the Embassy
Ballroom. This aisle or passageway ran to the right from the pod-
ium in the direction of an exit door, which was the shortest route
from the room.

She said, however, that Senator KENNEDY did not walk toward
the group formed aisle, but instead walked in the opposite direction
toward the kitchen area. She said that she then heard a commotion,
something like a metal table striking a wall. She said that she
heard no shots or what sounded like gun shots,

KEARNS stated that she had never seen SIRHAN SIRHAN at any

time.

Date.
Congressman PHILLIP BURTON was contacted at the New
House Office Building at which time he stated that he was in
San Francisco, California on the evening of June 4, 1968, and
was at the California Hall located at 625 Polk Street where he
introduced TED KENNEDY as a speaker before a large gathering
in this hall.

Mr. BURTON said that there were two television sets
in front of the stage and these sets were tuned in to the events
which were taking place in Los Angeles, California, in connection
with Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY's political campaign. He said
that TED KENNEDY finished his talk shortly before midnight and
left the hall.

Mr. BURTON said that at about 12:15 a.m. on June 5,
1968, while still on the stage of the California Hall he heard
what sounded to him like four or five small firecrackers or
some kind of shots going off and thought possible that the
noise was coming from inside the California Hall. He said that
he realized shortly afterwards that the noises were coming from
the television sets which he previously mentioned. He said that
four or five minutes later he was approached by a radio announcer
whose name he could not recall at present and this individual
told him that Senator ROBERT KENNEDY had been shot. Mr. BURTON
said that he remembers remarking to this person, "My God, that's
not a very good rumor to spread", He said that he did not believe
this information at the time arid furthermore did not want to bring
himself to the realization that Senator KENNEDY had actually been
shot.

Mr. BURTON said that seven or eight minutes after the
shooting, he was confronted by several reporters asking him about
the shooting but he told them that he had no comments for them.
He said that he shortly thereafter drove to the Fairmont Hotel
where he saw DAVID BURKE, TED KENNEDY's right-hand man and asked
BURKE if he had heard the news about Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. LANSING LAMONT, 5163 Tilder Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. (WDC), advised he is the national political
correspondent for Time, Incorporated, Suite 1200, 1120
Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

During the week of June 3-6, 1968, he was assigned
to the Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY campaign and was registered
staying at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

Mr. LAMONT advised he was in the Embassy Room of
the Ambassador Hotel during the time Senator KENNEDY was
giving his victory speech subsequent to the California primary
election.

Mr, LAMONT was to the left front of the podium as
he faced Senator KENNEDY during the speech. After Senator
KENNEDY furnished speaking, he observed the Senator and his
party exit through a curtained doorway to the rear of the
podium. Mr. LAMONT then walked towards the television cameras
located at the rear of the Embassy Room and started towards
the corridor which would lead to the Colonial Room where the
Senator was to give a short press conference to members of
the writing press. As he neared the door leading to the
corridor, Mr. LAMONT heard loud shouting and screaming coming
from the area near the podium. As the shouting grew louder,
he walked over in an effort to determine cause. It was
perhaps two or three minutes after Senator KENNEDY left the
speakers platform that this shouting began, He then determined
persons including Senator KENNEDY had been shot in the serving
kitchen area.

Mr. LAMONT said he entered the serving kitchen
area and observed Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor and
another man who was wounded lying almost head to toe to the
Senator.

JOHN REGULY, correspondent, "Toronto Star", National
Press Building, furnished the following information:

REGULY advised that JOHN BREHL of the "Toronto Star"
is permanently assigned to the home office in Toronto. BREHL
was not in Los Angeles at the time of KENNEDY's assassination,
but flew to Los Angeles the next day to help REGULY cover the
story.

At the time of the assassination, REGULY was sitting
in the Temporary Press Room talking to HILLIARY LAMB. They
were awaiting for an appearance of KENNEDY when they heard
popping sourds and went to the kitchen area. REGULY saw
KENNEDY on the ground and also saw SIRHAN being held by ROSEY
GRIER, RAFER JOHNSON, and an unknown white man. GRIER had
hold of SIRHAN's hand and gun and was pointing the gun towards
the wall. GRIER then took the gun from SIRHAN and passed it to
JOHNSON. REGULY then saw GEORGE PLIMPTON grab SIRHAN.

REGULY had never seen SIRHAN before. He heard
SIRHAN say while he was being held by GRIER and JOHNSON, "I
can explain, I can explain”. At this time, GRIER was twisting
SIRHAN's leg.

Out in the hall a girl who was a KENNEDY aide to
FRANK MANKIEWICZ was saying that she had thrown him (meaning
SIRHAN) out twkee and that she did not see how he got back in.
REGULY did not know this girl's name, but said she was tall,
large boned, and brunette.
