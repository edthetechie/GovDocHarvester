Thank you for your recent correspondence to the
Attorney General regarding Stokely Carmichael and
H. "Rap" Brown.

We are looking into Carmichael's activities, including
his travel to Cuba, to ascertain whether he has acted in
violation of any Federal statute within our jurisdiction.

In the event sufficient evidence is developed to establish )
a violation of Federal law, appropriate action will be
undertaken. J

With respect to the shocking statements attributed to
Carmichael in Havana, as reported in the press, it should be
noted that it is necessary to have competent witnesses to
such statements and it is quite difficult to obtain such
witnesses, particularly in an unfriendly country. Nonetheless, |
in the event any of his activities in Cuba reflect a violation
of our laws and witnesses can be obtained to testify to his )
activities, you may be assured that prosecution will be
undertaken. J

In addition, the Department of State has advised that
a letter was sent to the United States address appearing in
Carmichael's passport application informing him that his
United States passport has been revoked. Since Carmichael
is an American citizen, having acquired derivative citizenshi
through his father, his return to this country could not be
prevented.

I strongly suggest thas you psblicize the fact that noither Rishard Speck

condition had to be bade Speck killed 8 people in about 1966 or 19673 he

I don't know if judges are working half the time or what is the matter,

but something is all wronge If Congress has to authorize more judges, then

you should at least ask for them with a large public flourishe If the fault

is not Congress’, then whose is it? And let's get them on the balle

This administration was elected with a charge to do something about crime,
ae

Speck & Sirhan ;
The two,mentioned were not in the federal category of crimes, but there ig

some kind of fantastic foot-drakking occurringse You should get the administrars

exonerated by fixing the blame elsewhere, or if the blame is federal, whey is |

going to be done about it?

fy dear Mr. President:
A“ tast night, on TV, I heard Milton Eisenhower give a brief report from
/the investigation on violence. He said TV programs excite violence
/ pecause on television children "see the good guys and the bad guys
/ get what they want by using violence."

"The good guys as well as the bad guys get what they want by using
violence." That is an accurate measurement of what is wrong with our
world. We are too violent! We kill for sport, we kill for food, we
kill for profit.

Last night, and Tuesday, we were shown, over TV, how meat companies kill —_
the animals we eat. It is brutal! not only for the animals, but also
for the men who do the killing, It makes meat a repulsive food.
Judged by the Commandment "Thou shalt not kill," all wars are immoral.
It is immoral to kill for sport, for food, for profit. As a nation we
justify all these forms of violence. And yet we are shocked and
horrified and full of wrath and revenge when an indivi np
the nation does. i Sa aoe

, SOT RMT ac USTICE R
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan's jury doomed him to San Quentin's ges chamber be-#
cause "they viewed the June 5, 1968 slaying of Sena $4 Fegeqt 3: Keapeqie
as a heinoug and coldblooded act." His execution in esSen oO

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy asked the court to spare thellife of Si DIV.
said, "my brother was a man of love and sentiment and compassion. HF d

not have wanted his death to be a cause for the taking of another life."

What has happened to our sense of justice? We taught Sirhan to kill, and
now we (society) want to kill him for doing what we taught him to do.

Sensitive children see killing: crimes, murders, warfare over TV. They
see it in newspapers and magazines. They hear older people talk about
it. Their daddy goes to war and maybe he never comes home again, or

he comes home without an arm or a leg.

But, Sirhan experienced the horror of killing. WAR for him was real
horror, not a black and white TV picture of horror. He experienced
what no child should experience. ’

We adults are the criminals! So let us not condemn Sirhan for his
twisted life, Let us condemn our way of life because it is twisting the j
lives of too many children. :

The magnitude of our violence is greater than that of any other nation,

because we are the only nation that has dropped atom bombs on other human
beings. Our guilt is so great, we should assume leadership in a world-

wide effort to build a world that is right for children! a world without:

war, hunger, poverty, illiteracy, pollution, etc, This degree of co-
operation would help to reduce the. population explosion. To accomplish

this you should create a- Department of Peace, and a Department of Pop-

ulation and Environment. conten

‘Dear Senator Murphy:

I am enclosing an article by Budd Schulberg
which apveared in the Los Angeles Times "West" .
marazgine, The thesis of the article is that there |
are some crimes which have. such ‘an overwhelming
effect on the entire country(political assination,
for example) that they cannet be tried and judged
by conventional trial procedures and thus, a
radically new means of handling such cases must

. be devised.

It would avpear that Mr. Schulberg's argument’
has merit, and I would appreciate you giving it
your consideration. TI would be very interested
in any comments that you might have.

“White Flame” murder trial for a
Los Angeles paper, a typical South-
em California crime of passion, a
sob sister’s delight. Compared to the
screaming headlines of that trial, or
of a “Black Dahlia” or a “Dr. Finch
Murder Case,” the trial of the
assassin of Bobby Kennedy was
reported with second-section modes-
ty. For us the trial of Sirhan Sirhan
was an eerie one to cover because it
was the first (and we pray the last)
time we were to attend a trial for
a murder we had witnessed with our
own eyes.

The security check of those
privileged few permitted to move
through the protective barrier and
enter the courtroom was the most
thorough body-search we have ever
experienced. . First you removed
everything from your pockets, every
pen, pencil, slip of paper, coin,
paper clip. Then you leaned
forward on a table while young
officers frisked you carefully from

neck to shoelace. (Lady reporters:

said they even had to remove their
shoes, nor were bras sacrosanct to
the distaff fuzz.) After the body-

search an electronic gadeset was run

‘slowly along every inch of you to
make ‘scientifically certain that you
were not carrying a concealed
weapon; no tiny revolver, no pocket
knife, not even a pin to endanger the
precious life of the young man who
robbed us of Robert F. Kennedy.

At one point in my search one day,
the electronic device began to
‘scream and two pennies were
detected, forgotten in a small inside
flap within a larger side pocket.
Neither were newspapers admissible.
The jury was not to be exposed to
the daily press, though how one
could break through the bartier of
bailiffs and plainclothesmen _ be-
tween the press section and the jury
box would have been a problem for
Houdini. Perhaps they feared we
would roll our newspapers into clubs
or spears and turn the decorous trial
into the chaos of Dallas.

After one had run the gamut of
state troopers and Hall of Justice
security officers. the courtroom itself
was rather an anticlimax. It was
smaller, for instance, than the
courtroom in Beverly Hills where
amy wife went on trial for driving 35
miles an hour in a 25-mile zone. It
was similar in size to the courtroom

vs.

(Last of two parts)

The trial of Sirhan 8. Sirhan
certainly was a cut above
Dallas, or Memphis. But the
magnitude of the crime and
its nature as a political
rather than personal act—
the modern American
assassination syndrome—
makes ordinary local

‘corridor outside

Bulg ck is a ruddy-faced rock’of .
ama th a Spencer Tracy stoop,
in fact with a Spencer Tracy no-
nonsense All-American directness;
he was flanked by David Fitts, a
sophisticated man who sometimes
used phrases and words his witnes-
ses did not understand, and by John
Howard, barrel-chested and, like
Compton, suggesting square and

- solid rather than cube and complex.

In the opposite corner we found
one of those superstars that criminal
law enjoys—Southern California’s
answer to Melvin Belli, Percy
Foreman and Lee Bailey—Grant
Cooper. While the prosecution went
about its business with a kind of
stolid semi-thoroughness, Grant
Cooper gives a prize-winning per-
formance, somehow managing to
superimpose Cary Grant on Gary
Cooper. Stylish, urbane, disingen-
uous, sometimes grinning at his own
cleverness, Grant Cooper created an
impression of being in complete
command of these proceedings, like
a circus master dancing with theatri-
cal elegance from ring to ring. A
dapper, scene-stealing leading man
was Grant Cooper, with a star
performer's love of limelight. During
court recesses, rather than take the |
15 or 20 minutes to catch his breath |
or confer quietly with colleagues as
did his less flamboyant opponents,
Grant Cooper enjoyed throwing
himself into the whirlpool question-
ing of the press milling in the
the courtroom.
Overshadowed but very much a
figure in his own was Emile Zola
Berman, who flew out from New
York to join forces with Cooper. A
potent team they made. .

Berman, with the beak and
complexion of an angry, featherless
bird of prey, is Jewish and was
understandably touchy about attach-
ing himself to a case so inextricably
bound to the Arab cause. There was
one entire morning devoted to
testimony from Palestinian Arabs
describing their forcible removal
from their homes in Jerusalem,
suggesting how the displacement and
maltreatment could poison and
cripple the personality of a sensitive
child like Sirhan Sirhan, And Sirhan
himself had taken the stand to
render what amounted to a detailed
lecture on the birth of Zionism and
the complex diplomacy of the
Middle East that led to the emer-
gence of Israel. “Boy, am I going to
catch hell in New York today!” said

Then why did Emile Zola Berman

Because unpopular cases and causes
must be defended as spiritedly as
popular ones. In this case, Berman
would explain, there was an added
incentive: California has a new de-

enter te Couriroom was the most
thorough bedy-search we have ever
experienced. First you removed

erything from your pockets, every

en, pencil, slip of paper, coin,
paper clip. Then you leaned
forward on a table while young
officers frisked you carefully from
neck to shoelace. (Lady reporters
said they even had to remove their
shoes, nor were bras sacrosanct to
the distaff fuzz.) After the body-
search an electronic gadget was run
slowly along every inch of you to
make scientifically certain that you
were mot carrying a concealed
weapon; no tiny revolver, no pocket
knife, not even a pin to endanger the

| precious life of the young man who

robbed us of Robert F. Kennedy.
At one point in my search one day,
the electronic device began to

‘scream and two pennies were

detected, forgotten in a small inside

flap: within a larger side pocket.

Neither were newspapers admissible.

The jury was not to be exposed to

the daily press, though how one
could break through the barrier of
bailiffs and plainclothesmen _be-
tween the press section and the jury
box would have been a problem for
Houdini. Perhaps they feared we
would rolt our newspapers into clubs

or spears and turn the decorous trial

into the chaos oi Duiias.

-After one had run the gamut of
state troopers and Hall of Justice

smaller, for instance, than the
courtroom in Beverly Hills where
amy wife went on trial for driving 35
miles an hour in a 25-mile zone. It
was similar in size to the courtroom
where we assisted one of our young
Watts writers charged with interfer-
ing with the arrest of an alleged
traffic offender. With its nine rows
of seats for 65 spectators, this
seemed an ordinary courtroom for a
routine trial; certainly not the scene
of judgment for a crime that had
shaken the world and deprived us of
our most promising presidential
candidate. .

The trial of Sirhan B. Sirhan

certainly was a cut above
Dallas, or Memphis. But the
magnitude of the crime and
its nature as a political
rather than personal act—
the modern American
assassination syndrome—
makes ordinary local
court proceedings inadequate
to cope with it, or define
it, delve into its causes
and resolve questions of
conspiracy. Perhaps a new
kind of special national
tribunal is needed for
political murder—to make
the trial fit the crime.

PROSECUTIVE ACTION CONCERNING
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN


--- Page 47 ---
LA 56-156

On February 4, 1969, trial of SIRHAN BISHARA _
SIRHAN was resumed at Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Court proceedings consisted of efforts on the part of
the defense to support the motion for dismissal of the
Grand Jury indictment concerning SIRHAN. SIRHAN and his_

mother MARY SIRHAN, both testified concerning their So

_economie status. Judge HERBERT B. WALKER denied the defense,
motion. rn
- On February 5;.1969, efforts were made by both
the. prosecution and the defense to select alternate jurors
to serve for this trial.

The twelve jurors previously selected were sworn

‘in but will not be sequestered until the. six alternate jurors”

are Selected.

On February 11, 1969, selection of all jurors
was completed and further proceedings were continued until
February 13, 1969. . :

Defense Attorney, GRANT B, COOPER, on February 13,
1969, made a motion for a mistrial in this matter based on ©
recent articles appearing in ‘the local press that SIRHAN
might be considering a change of plea to guilty. All members

of the jury including the six alternate. members were individually

examined in the Judge's chambers relative to the effect that.
this publicity might have had on them. Following the exami-
nation of the jurors, Judge WALKER denied the motion for a

- mistrial.

Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney, DAVID

FITTS then made the opening statements to the court on behalf |

of the prosecution attorneys.

_ Defense Attorney, EMILE ZOLA _BERIAN presented the

opening arguments for the defense on February 14, 1969,

and the first four witnesses to appear in this case testified.

These included employees of the Ambassador who were employed
on the night that Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was shot.

LA 56-156 ; ; . - : . : Long

The defense attorney at the beginning of the court
sesston on February 20, 1969, again moved for a mistrial
based on local press accounts that SIRHAN was willing to _
pleaé guilty to a first degree murder charge if he could
be assured of a sentence of life imprisonment rather than
death. These proceedings took place in the Judge's chambers
but apparently the story leaked to the local press and at ~-
the afternoon recess, Judge WALKER made available copies
of transcripts concerning proceedings in.chambers on that
morning so that all press: representatives would have the
same inforiation.

oe

During the court session on February: 25, 1969,

the prosecution moved to admit: as evidence in this trial
the diary and other papers of SIRHAN that were obtained in
a search of SIRHAN's residence on June 5, 1968. The defense
objected to the admission into evidence of these papers and |
Judge WALKER overruled their objection and permitted their entry.
Just prior to the noon recess, SIRHAN stood up in’ court and
stated "your Honor, it is not admitted into evidence yet".
SIRHAN's outburst was related to testimony then being given

' by LAURENCE SLOAN, Examiner of questioned documents for the.
Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. :

On February 26, 1969, the prosecution rested the
case and the. jury was given copies of STRHAN's notebooks
which had been admitted into evidence. Court proceedings
were continued until February 28, 1969.

The defense opened it's case at the court session
on February 28, 1969 and during the afternoon session while
a witness from the Pasadena School system was testifying
concerning the academic record of SIRHAN, SIRHAN stood up
in court and addressed the Judge. His attorney seated him,
requested permission to approach.the bench and the jury was
excused. SIRHAN requested permission to speak and indicated
a desire to change his plea to guilty to murder in the first
degree. SIRHAN. also requested to be executed and to dis-
associate himself from his present staff of defense attornéys.
In response to a question from the Judge, SIRHAN indicated that
he had willfully killed Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY after 20
years of premeditated malice +3 “@eorethought.


--- Page 49 ---
TA 56-156

SIRHAN insisted that he be allowed to represent .
himself and the Judge declared-him incompetent to defend
himself. The Judge ,ruled that the trial would continue and
he admonished STREAN that if there were further outbursts
of this nature, he would be physically restrained in the
court.

‘When court reconvened, defense Attorney GRANT
COOPER, speaking for himself and the other defense counsels,
. made a motion that all defense attorneys be disassociated —
from the case due to differences of opinion between them-"
selves, and SIRHAN as to the proper conduct of the trial.
This motion was denied by the Judge and trial was ordered
.to proceed.

During the court session on March 6, 1969, while
SIRHAN was testifying as a witness, the defense attorney,
after conference with the prosecution and the Judge, read
the entire transcript to the court, including the jury of
the events that occurred during SIRHAN's outbursts in the.
court session on February 28, 1969. SIRHAN was then
excused aS a witness. :

: Judge WALKER at the opening of the court session of
March 7, 1969, advised the jury that in determining the guilt
or innocence of SIRHAN to disregard the testimony given on
March 6, 1969 regarding the statements made by SIRHAN at

the court session on February 28, 1969, while the jury was
absent. Prosecution Attorney, DAVID FITTS made a statement

. to the court that he considered the Judge's instructions in
error and felt that the jury shouid be able to consider the
statements in anyway that they wished. The Judge concurred
with the prosecution, and defense continued with the presenta-
tion of defense witnesses.

During the court session of Mairch 28, 1969, it was
announced that one of the regular jurors had been taken ill
during the night and an alternate juror was selected to re-
place the regular juror

“LA 56-156"

On April 8, 1969, both the defense and prosecution
. attorneys rested their case. Closing arguments were made
at the court: session following April 8, 1969 and on April 14,

' . 19669, Judge WALKER read the instructions to the jury and the

case ° was sent to the jury for deliberation at 3:00 p.m. on
this date.

On April 17, 1969, the jury. returned a verdict
in this case finding SIRHAN guilty of murder in the first
degree on count one of the indictment. On the remainder of
the five counts, SIRHAN was found guilty assault with a _
dangerous weapon with intent to commit muyder. The penalty
trial to determine the possibility of the death sentence
was scheduled to begin on April 21, 1969.

On April 23, 1969, the jury in the trial of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN, returned a verdict of death for SIRHAN. Further
hearings in’ this. matter were continued until May’ 21, 1969.

a

On May 21; 1969, defense Attorney GRANT COOPER,
presented arguments for a motion for a new trial for SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN. The motion fora new trial was based cn
13 points of alleged court errors in the trial of SIRHAN.
The motion for the new trial was denied by Judge WALKER on
all 13 points which had been specified by the defense.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN WIRIN. and FRED OKRAND of the ;
- Amerigan Civil Liberties Union" joined defense attorney's argu-
ment for a hearing on the constitutionality of the death

- penalty. The request for this hearing was denied by the

Judge.

Prior to the arguments concerning a motion for a
new trial, Los Angeles District Attorney EVELLE J. YOUNGER,
presented a letter he had received from Senator EDWARD
KENNEDY requesting clemency,for SIRHAN.

After the motion for a new trial was denied, Judge
WALKER formally sentenced SIRHAN to death and ordered him:
remanded to San Quentin Prison within ten days. The Judge
pronounced that the findings of the jury were correct in this
