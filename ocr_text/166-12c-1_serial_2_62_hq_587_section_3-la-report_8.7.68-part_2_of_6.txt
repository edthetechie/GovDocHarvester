JUNE ISACKSON, Headquarters Office Manager,
Kennedy Campaign Headquarters, 5615 Wilshire Boulevard,
advised that due to the large number of individuals who
worked at the Kennedy Campaign Headquarters, she is unable
to specifically recall any of the individuals assigned to
conduct telephone soliciting. She stated that in this
regard, possibly MARY GILLESPIE, who resides at 1643 North
Dillon Street, Los Angeles, could furnish information
concerning the individuals who worked as telephone solicitors
as GILLESPIE supervised the telephone soliciting program.

ISACKSON advised that individuals who worked at
the Kennedy Campaign Headquarters came from two categories,
one category being volunteer workers and the other being
paid workers furnished by two Los Angeles employment firms.
She identified the employment firms as The Peakioad Company,
3057 Wilshire Boulevard, and Olsten of Los Angeles,
Incorporated, 3735 Wilshire Boulevard.

ISACKSON advised that she recalled a volunteer
worker by the name of KAIBAR KHAN, also known as "Goody",
and advised he was responsible for bringing in some 15 to
20 volunteer workers prior to election day. She stated that
all of these workers were individuals of Middle Eastern
@escent. ISACKSON described Goody as being a cordial,
mannerly person and a willing worker but who did things
which appeared to her to be strange. She explained that
Goody insisted that all of the volunteer workers he brought
in list their addresses as 1055/3 Wilshire Boulevard, which
was the address Goody listed as his. Goody also related
conflicting stories concerning his ancestry, first indicating
that he was of Turkish descent and then stating he was
Persian. He also claimed to be a good friend of the KENNEDY
family and a supporter of Senator KENNEDY and made several
statements indicating that he knew Senator KENNEDY was going
to win the election, but, for several unexplained reasons,
ISACKSON felt that Goody was not sincere and that he was a
phony.

On June 16, 1965, EVEREVYT BUCKNER, SR., 129 East

contacted the Los Angeles Office of the FBI. At that time,

information.

As a result of this information, BUCKNER was contacted
by SA KLING and SA CHARLES W. BADGLEY at his residence in

ROLAND GLEN WILLIAMS, who resides at 2428 Sierra
Leone, Rowland Heights, California, telephone number
965-1870, and is employed by the Jerseymaid Milk Products,
1040 West Slauson, telephone number PL 3-1231, supplied
the following information to SA GEORGE M, KLING and Detective
Sergeant MIKE MC GANN, Homicide Division, Los Angeles
Police Department (LAPD), after the identities of the
interviewing officers were made known.

WILLIAMS advised on June 4, 1968, he and his
wife, CLAUDIA, went to the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club,
4001 Fish Canyon Road, Duarte, California, in order to do
some target shooting. WILLIAMS stated that neither he nor
his wife knew the exact route to take in order to go to the
gun range; therefore, they stopped at the Briar Patch Bar
where his wife is employed and obtained directions. They
continued on towards the gun club and eventually stopped
and asked a Deputy Sheriff for further directions. WILLIAMS

‘stated that he did not know the identity of the Deputy
Sheriff from whom they had asked directions. .

WILLIAMS advised they arrived at the range at
approximately 3:50 PM and went to the Range Officer's
Building in order to make arrangements for target shooting.
He stated that the Range Officer informed them that the
range closed for firing at 5:00 PM and, as a result, they
would have only about one hour in which to shoot, WILLIAMS
stated that he and his wife discussed this at some length
and he said in all probability, this discussion could
probably be termed an argument by a bystander.

He stated he had recently purchased a 30-30
caliber rifle which he intended to shoot and his wife had
received a .22 caliber pistol for Christmas during the
year 1966, which she had never fired, and it was her intention
to use this gun on the range. WILLIAMS stated that he
recalls his wife saying something to the effect that she
had had the gun for a long time and she wanted to learn how

to shoot it today. WILLIAMS advised that the Range Officer
informed them that they could not fire the pistol and rifle
on the same range and that it would be necessary for his
wife to go to the pistol range and he to the rifle range.
WILLIAMS stated that he paid the admission fee of $2 per
person plus 50 cents target deposit for him and his wife
but stated he did not sign a shooter's roster. He advised
he did not sign a roster because it was his understanding
that the roster was to be signed by shooters who were
members of the gun club.

He stated that after paying the admission fee and
securing their targets, he went back to his automobile
and cleaned excess oil and grease from the weapons prior
to shooting. He then returned to the range taking his
wife's pistol to her on the pistol range and noticed the
Range Officer placing his wife's target into position.
WILLIAMS stated that he saw only one other individual on
the range at this time and this individual, whom he could
describe at that time as only a small and slender individual,
was firing around gum positions 11 or 12.

WILLIAMS advised that he then proceeded to the
rifle range where he fired for approximately 30 minutes
and then returned to the pistol range. Upon returning to
the pistol range, he noticed the individual whom he had
previously seen on the pistol range next to his wife.
WILLIAMS stated that to the best of his knowledge, his
wife was firing around gun positions 21 or 22. He stated
the individual remarked to him that his, WILLIAMS', wife's
gun was shooting to the left. He stated that he, his wife
and the individual engaged in a short conversation concerning
itself entirely with guns,

WILLIAMS stated that he would describe this
individual as being about 5'3" to 5'5" in height, in his
early 20's, Spanish looking, with dark skin and hair,
weighing about 130 pounds and dressed in casual clothes.

WILLIAMS stated that the individual gave him
his gun for the purpose of shooting and, just as he,
WILLIAMS, was ready to shoot the gun, the Range Officer
called time, indicating that there would be no more firing
on the range. WILLIAMS advised that he could not describe
the gun other than the fact that it was a small blue gun
and that the individual was firing Mini Magnum shells.

At this point, WILLIAMS was shown a photograph
of SIRHAN SIRHAN and he stated that the photograph looked
very much like the individual whom he had seen on the range
except that his hair was neater than it appeared in the
photograph.

WILLIAMS advised that he and his wife then left
the range at a time he estimated to be almost exactly
5:00 PM, and that, at the same time, the individual also
left the range. He stated that he recalled the individual
going to a pink and white Dodge or DeSoto, model unknown.

WILLIAMS stated that during the time that he was
on the pistol range, he saw no one else on the range other
than this individual and his wife and that he heard the
individual say nothing about any future plans that he
might have.

WILLIAMS supplied the following physical description
of himself:

Date of Birth

Height 23"

Weight 220 pounds

Hair Biond

Eyes Blue

He stated on June 4, 1968, to the best of his

Mrs. FRANCES HOLLAND, 552 Eldorado Drive,
Escondido, California, advised as follows:

She is the Southern California Grand Counsellor
of the Rosicrucian Order, also known as the Ancient Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC). She advised the state and
international headquarters of AMORC have designated her to
handle any inquiries concerning SIRHAN SIRHAN's membership
in AMORC. She stated SIRHAN is a member of the Supreme
Grand Lodge, San Jose, California, which is a corresponding
membership and to her knowledge he did not attend meetings
bus received correspondence and instructions by mail from
San Jose, California, and in-.turn submitted his lessons by
mail to San Jose, California.

Mrs, HOLLAND advised the San Jose Office maintains
a complete file of correspondence with all members, which
file contains the members original application form. She
understands that FBI Agents at San Jose, California, were
permitted to review SIRHAN's file and were given a duplicated
copy of his application blank.

AMORC has local lodges and chapters to which some
members belong, although membership in a local club is not
required. Mrs, HOLLAND stated she has checked and determined

nat SIRHAN was not a member of the Pasadena Chapter or any
other lodge or chapter. SIRHAN, however, did once, and only
once, visit one of these subordinate bodies. He attended the
weekly meeting of the Pasadena Chapter on the evening of —
June 4, 1963, Mrs. HOLLAND made available a page of the
guest register of the Pasadena Chapter, which bears the
signature SIRHAN SIRHAN, 696 East Howard, Pasadena, and
reflectg that he is a member of AMORC, with membership
number 8-413-477. On the date column of this form SIRHAN
entered the date April 16, 1968. Mrs. HOLLAND stated that
this is an error and SIRHAN probably used this date because
the last previous registration was on that date. Mrs. HOLLAND

gonfirmed by talking to the supervisor of the Pasadena
Chapter, that SIRHAN visited that chapter on the evening
of June 4, 1968. This supervisor is SHERMAN LIVINGSTON,
2555 Vista Laguna Terrace, Pasadena, California, telephone
number 794-6141.

LIVINGSTON told Mrs. HOLLAND he recalls SIRHAN
telling people at the meeting how to pronounce his name.
LIVINGSTON looked for SIRHAN after the meeting but he was
uneble to find him.

In signing in, SIRHAN showed he was a first degree
member. Mrs. HOLLAND stated that this is a beginner's
degree which would indicate membership of less than one
year,

AMORC has no full time hall in Pasadena. The
chapter meets every Tuesday night. Master of the chapter
is THEODORE R. STEVENS, 886 Pullman Street, Los Angeles,
California, telephone number 257-9368.

Mrs. HOLLAND stated she would call Mr. LIVINGSTON
and Mr, STEVENS on the evening of June 12, 1968, to instruct
them to cooperate in answering inquiries from the FBI. the
stated the wives of both of these individuals are upset
with the bad publicity given AMORC in the press and LIVINGSTON
and STEVENS should be contacted by telephone to arrange an
appointment.

Mrs. HOLLAND subsequently telephonically contacted
the FBI Office, San Diego, California, on June 12, 1968,
and advised as follows:

She was in telephonic contact with Mr, LIVINGSTON
and discussed the matter of being interviewed by the FBI at
Los Angeles. She stated that Mr. LIVINGSTON reviewed his
notes and indicated that he had attended the Pasadena meeting

on May 28, 1968, rather than June 4, 1968. Therefore, Mrs.
HOLLAND assumes the appearance of SIRHAN SIRHAN at the
Pasadena meeting was on May 28, 1968, rather than as
previously reported on June 4, 1968.

According to Mrs. HOLLAND, the date of appearance
of SIRHAN SIRHAN can be verified by contacting Mr. STEVENS,
the Master of the Pasadena Chapter.

Mrs. HOLLAND further advised that she has
instructed Mr. STEVENS to make available to the FBI
the complete membership list of persons present on the
night SIRHAN SIRHAN attendsd the Pasadena Chapter
meeting and aiso to furnish information regarding the
topics discussed on the night of that meeting.

Mrs. ELEANOR ANDREW, Treasurer of the Akhraton Chapter
of the Ancient Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis (AMORC), 2031
East Villa, Pasadena, California, was interviewed at her place
of employment, Royal Laundry and Dry Cleaning, 443 South Ray-
mond, Pasadena, California, residence address, 946 Jane Place,
Pasadena.

She advised that she was present at the May 28, 1968,
meeting of her Akhraton Chapter, when SIRHAN SIRHAN attended.
She stated that SIRHAN was a guest at her chapter's meeting
and that she had not seen him prior to the meeting of May 28,
1968, nor since that meeting. She only observed him at one
time during the meeting noting that he was a stranger. At the
time she observed him, he was talking to one of the two Coloinbes,
which is Egyptian for candle lighters. These Colombes have
to be girls between the ages of 12 and 18. She cannot recall
which of the girls SIRHAN was talking to but it had to be
(First Name Unknown) ABANG, or (First Name Unknown) ACOB.

ANDREW stated she cannot recall observing SIRHAN
again during the meeting. She stated that at that particular
meeting night, she was not in attendance the full time as she
left the meeting to pick up a ring which was to be presented
to the past Grand Master. She stated that SIRHAN left prior
to her leaving the meeting. The meeting was from approximately
8:00 to 9:00 p.m. with a 45 minute social gathering afterwards.

She advised that an AMORC member must show a member-
ship card to attend a meeting of any chapter. They were also
required, however, to sign the guest book. As best as she
can recall, SIRHAN was the only guest that evening. THEODORE
STEVENS, Secretary, maintains the membership book and guest

Mr. THEODORE STEVENS, 586 Pulman Street, Los Angeles,
advised that he is the Master of the Chapter, “Ancient
Mystical Order Rosae Crucis" (AMORC), having regular
Tuesday weekly meetings in the Pasadena area.

Mr. STEVENS advised that he is familiar with the
name SITRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN as being a member of his
organization who attended a meeting on May 28, 1968,
at the Pasadena Chapter. Mr. STEVENS stated that he
definitely remembers SIRHAN's arriving on the evening
of May 28, 1968, at approximately 7:30 p.m., his signing
the guest registration, and his attendance at the meeting
which broke up shortly after 9:00 p.m. STEVENS stated that
this was the only meeting ever attended at his Chapter by
SIRHAN. Mr. STEVENS stated that he himself did not
converse with SIRHAN, but he advised that SIRHAN may possibly
have spoken to one or two members of his organization.

Mr, STEVENS was exhibited . photographs. of
six male individuals by SA PAUL CHAMBERLAIN, JR., and from
these Dhétographs Mr. STEVENS picked the photographs of
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN as being identical with the indivadual
in question.

STEVENS stated that he could find nothing in the
concepts of his organization, which is a mystical, philosophical
and fraternal organization, that would have influenced SIRHAN
to take action against Senator KENNEDY.

STEVENS stated further that his order teaches
that drastic changes are not permanent changes and that,
therefore, changes must come through evolution. He advised
that AMORC is definitely not anti-Semetic and, in fact,
has many Jewish members.

vised that when she went to the meeting on the 28th of May, she
seaW a young man there and she went up and introduced herself
as they, the older‘members, are supposedto do to make the

apron as this is what they do before they go in for the lecture.
She advised she sat over to the other side of the room and she
did not see him again until about 9:00 p.m. when the meeting was
over and,as they were walking out, this’ individual, who
called himselt JOR handed in his apron. She advised she went
then to prepare refreshments but that JOE did not stay for any
refresments.

She recalled that during the meeting the lecturer
asked for a volunteer for a tactile experience, which she stated
is an experiment to determine . if an individualswhen touched;
can determine if he is being touched by one or two things. She
stated that SIRHAN, or JOF as he called himself that night, vol-
unteered for the experiment, but she stated she did not recall
too much about it as she has seen and heard the lecture many
times and that she fell asleep. She stated that her daughter,
IMOGENE, who was at the meeting,saw SIRHAN donate something to
the collection but she was not sure what.

She stated that she was certain he was not wearing a
weapon on this occasion because he was wearing tight blue jeans
and that she was sure she would have noticed a weapon if he had
one. She stated he spent most of his time at the book table
looking over the Literature before the meeting and that she did
not see him talking with anyone. She advised that her discussion

attendance at the convocation. She advised she did not meet
STRHAN, was not introduced to him, nor did she know him prior
to seeing him in attendance at this meeting. She stated at
this particular meeting of May 28, 1958, she was somewhat late
and immediately went to the choir area in order to get her
music out and ready for playing. She stated after watching
television when Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was shot and seeing
the pictures of STRHAN SIRHAN on television, she knows that
the person whose photograph she saw on television is identical
to the same person who was at their meeting on May 28, 1968.

Two photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN, one Los Angeles
Police Departinent photograph taken June 5, 1958 Number 495139.
and a photograph of SIRHAN being held by two unidentified men.
were exhibited to her. She advised that these photographs are
identical to the person she recalled seeing at the convocation.

Mrs. JACKA also stated in order for SIRHAN SLRHAN
to be in attendance at the meeting he would have to have a
membership card showing currently paid up dues. She stated
she has conversed with some of the other members and that she
has learned he was a member but that he has been stricken from
the rolls of the order.

She stated the Grand Chapter of the AMORC is at
San Jose Park, San Jose, California, and that this grand order
would in all probability be in a position to furnish some
background information regarding STRHAN SIRHAN. She also
advised that AMORC has chapters in Van Nuys Pomona, Whittier,
Long Beach, and Los Angeles, California.

Mrs. JACKA stated members can go from one chapter to
another to attend meetings: however, they would have to exhibit
their membership card to be allowed to attend.

and had a very brief conversation with SIRHAN B, SIRHAN at
approximately 8:00 p.m. at the above Chapter, He stated he has
no recollection of any matters discussed by SIRHAN nor did he

meeting was held, He stated he recalls no one escorting SIRHAN
and stated he was unaware as to how SIRHAN came to attend that
Chapter's meeting. He stated he does not recall SIRHAN in
attendance at the meeting and stated that he, therefore, was not
certain whether or not SITRHAN is a member of AMORC,

would be on record at the Grand Lodge, San Jose Rosai Crucian
Park, San Jose, California, where an application for metubership is
required, and often a picture is requested.

CLEMENS advised that it was extremely unlikely in his
opinion, that SIRHAN could have been a member of AMORC and have
committed the assassination of which he is accused as it is
entirely against all the teachings of the AMORC philosophy of
life.

CLEMENS advised that in order to attend a meeting of
AMORC, one must exhibit one's membership card issued by the
Grand Lodge and must be up to date in payment of one's membership
dues. He stated SIRHAN had never, to his knowledge, been in
attendance at an Akhnaton Chapter meeting prior to May 28, 1968
and he stated that he is certain he was not in attendance on
. Tuesday, June 4, 1968, He could furnish no further information

she is positive that this is the same individual that attended

had signed the same name as had appeared in the newspapers,

After SIRHAN had signed the register at the meeting,
SIRHAN was asked by SKIPWORTH if he had received literature

but on this evening after refreshments have been served, someone
else noticed that their "guest" was not there. Apparently
STRHAN had left the meeting right around 9:00 p.m.

SKIPWORTH added that new persons at their meetings
are usually introduced to attending members by a young girl
who is called a Colombe. The Colombe at this meeting would
have been either DELORES ABANG, or LUANA ACOB, as they were
present that night, to her knowledge, and they usually assist
each other in these duties. These two girls are both daughters

Mrs. GRACE BRYAN, 8450 East Mission Drive,

' Rosemead, California, telephone 285-1822, was contacted

at her residence, where she advised the following:

She is a member of the nonsectarian fraternal
organization known as the Ancient Mystical Order -
Rosae Crucis, which holds its meetings at 2031 East Villa,
Pasadena, California. She was in attendance at their
weekly meeting which was held on Tuesday, May 28, 1968.
She recalled there were approximately 190 persons present
at the meeting. Nearly all of the people in attendance
at the meeting were regular members with the exception in
this case of one or two individuals. She recalled one
thin young man, who was wearing a white shirt and wash
pants and who was in his 20s with bushy hair, as being
one of the "visitors" at the meeting.

Mrs. BRYAN was shown a photograph of STRHAN
SIRHAN and she advised the photograph closely resembled
the individual she saw there, but she could not say if the
two people are identical. She was introduced to this man
by someone at the meeting, but she could not recall who
that was. All members and visitors are given name tags
which they wear so that others can easily identify them.
She could not remember this individual's name but did
state she could not pronounce it after she had seen it and
that she thought the name was "similar" to SIRHAN.

Mrs. BRYAN, who is the Librarian for the organi-
zation, recalled this man looking at some of the books

with anyone at the meeting and more or less stayed by
himself. When a visitor attends a meeting, he is usually
introduced to the meeting room by a young girl who is
known as a "colombe", but Mrs. BRYAN could not remember
who the young girl was at this particular meeting as the

SKIPWORTH, 11114 Highland Oaks Drive, Arcadia, California,
telephone 446-9331, would know who this girl would have
been and also would have a list of all in attendance at
this particular meeting. According to Mrs. BRYAN, ILLEEN
SKIPWORTH is employed during the week and sometimes on
Saturdays by Clayton Manufacturing Company, El Monte,
Califoria.

Refreshments are always served at the meetings
just after the convocation and, as refreshments were being
served that night, Mrs. BRYAN approached this male indivi-
dual and asked him if he would like to have some refresh-
ments. She said. he did not reply but quickly turned and
left the meeting room. She said she had not seen him at
any previous meetings nor has she seen him since. She
advised the meetings start at 8:00 P.M. and convocation
closes at 9:00 P.M, or a few minutes after and therefore
this individual left around 9:00 P.M.

Mr. EDWARD L. RYMAN, 2316 Monte Vista, Pasadena,
California, telephone 792-6808, was contacted at his residence
and voluntarily advised as follows:

He is a member of the Ancient Mystical Order of
Rosae Crucis (AMORC) known as the Rosicrucian Order and he
attends meetings every Tuesday night at the Akhnaton
Chapter, 2031 East Villa, Pasadena, California. He is cur-
rently a member of the ritual team of this chapter and takes
part in the ceremonies conducted during the regular lodge
meeting. He has been a member of the Rosicrucian Order for
approximately two years and has attended the Akhnaton Chapter
since December, 1967. He has not missed a meeting since
March, 1965 and was in attendance during the May 28, 1963
meeting.

He arrived at the lodge on May 28, 1968 at appro-
ximately 7:45 p.m. anc immediately donned his robe for the
ceremonies. He commented that the regular meeting was from
5:00 p.m. until 9:00 p.m. and following the meeting there was
usually a coffee session, however, he very seldom stayed for
coffee. Mr. RYMAN stated he recalls on this particular date
there was a stranger in attendance at this meeting, however,
he could not recall anything out of the ordinary and it was
not uncommon for a new person to show up for a meeting. He
stated it was possible to be a correspondent member and not
attend a regular meeting at the local chapter. He recalls
the stranger, who was in attendance on this date, as being a
rather small person but he did take particular note of this
person's features or dress. Further he advised he nas some
distance from this person and the light was such that he was
not able to see this person's features. This person was seated
near the Grand Master, TED STEVENS, and RYMAN recalls that
there was an experiment conducted by Mr. STEVENS during this
meeting and SALLY HARDMAN and this stranger took part in the
experiment.

Mr. RYMAN stated he has observed the photograph of
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in newspaper publications and had not
associated him with the stranger, who was in attendance at this

lodge meeting. He stated it was very possible that SIRHAN was
this person, however, he was never close enough to recognize
him. He stated further that as soon as the meeting was over
and he had disrobed, he immediately departed.

Mr. RYMAN stated if. this person was in fact
SIRHAN he would have to be a member and have a membership
card which would have to have been checked by the outer
guardian. He stated he was not certain who the outer guardian
was on this specific date.

Mrs. DELORES MABEL ABANG, 405 East Howard Street, Pasadena
California, was contacted at her residence and voluntarily advised
as follows:

She is a member of the Rosicrucian Order, Ancient Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC). She attends meetings every Tuesday
night at the Akhnaton Chapter, 2031 East Villa Avenue, Pasadena,
and is a “Chantress" in the lodge ritual team.

She arrived at the May 28, 1958, meeting at approximately
8:00 p.m., and was parking her car opposite the temple when she
observed an unknown young white male approaching the temple on foot
and enter the temple. She believed he was a new member as she had
never seen him before and he stood out in her memory because most
of the members who attend are older adults and there are very few
young aduits who attend.

After parking her car, she entered the temple and went
to a dressing room to don her robe of the ritual team and did not
see this person again until she and the ritual team entered the
lodge room for the meeting. She then saw this man sitting on the
left side of the lodge beside a "Colombe", a young female member,
who apparently was acting as a guide and leader for this man.
During the meeting the lodge master, TED STEVENS, asked for
volunteers to take part in an experiment and this male volunteered
to take part in the experiment. ‘The experiment consisted of the
subject being blindfolded and being touched with various numbers
of objects and the subject endeavoring to identify the number of
objects which were placed against various parts of his body.
Following the experiment, the man took a seat on the right side
of the temple and did not return to his original seat. She did
not observe this man again as she was busy taking part in the
ritualistic part of the meeting. When the meeting was over, she
returned to the dressing room to remove her robe and when she
finished, she went to the area where the members have refreshments
following the meeting. She did not see this person with the members
having refreshments and recalls that SHERMAN LIVINGSTON, AMORC Grand
Inspector, inquired where the young man had gone, and an unrecalled
member said the young man had already left the temple. She recalled
this was shortly after 9:00 p.m.

She stated she saw a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN on
television after the assassination of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
and recognized SIRHAN as being the young man she had described
above as being the unknown young man in attendance at the May 28,
1968, ineeting. She described the man at the meeting as follows:

Race White

Age Early twenties
Conplexion Appeared to be Cuban
Hair “Thick, curly, black
Attire Sport shirt and slacks

Mrs, ABANG stated that in order for a person to get
in the lodge meetings, the person is required to present a current
membership card which is normally examined by the lodge's "Outer
Guardian", She recalled that SALLY HARDMAN was the “Outer
Guardian" at the May 28, 1968, meeting and assumes that HARIMAN
would have checked SIRHAN's membership card prior to admitting
him inside the temple, although Mrs. ABANG did not observe this.

Mrs. ABANG stated her daughter, DELORES MARIE (DEE) ABANG .
is also a "Colombe" and was taking part in the ritual at the
May 28, 1968, meeting but she had nothing to do with SIRHAN at the
meeting as the other "Colombe", LUANA ACOB, was assigned to guide
SIRHAN at the meeting.

Mrs. ABANG stated she and her daughter left the temple
together and they did not see SIRHAN again. She stated the May 20,
1968, meeting was the only time she had ever seen SIRHAN,

Mrs. ABANG was shown a group of photographs including:

Miss DELORES MARIE (DEE) ABANG, age 15, 405 East Howard
Street, Pasadena, California, was contacted at her residence and
voluntarily furnished the following information in the presence
of her mother, Mrs. DELORES MABEL ABANG.

She is a member of the Ancient Mystical Rosae Crucis
(AMORC), known as the Rosicrucian Order, as is her mother. She
attends the Akhnaton Chapter, 2031 East Villa Avenue, Pasadena,
and is a "Colombe" of the lodge. A "Colombe" is a young female
virgin member who has ritualistic duties during the convocation.

She went to the May 28, 1968, meeting with LUANA ACOB,
another Colombe and LUANA's mother, EMMA JEAN ACOB. Upon arriving
at the temple, she went to the dressing room where she donned her
robe for the ceremonies and did not go directly into the lodge
room. When she entered the lodge room with the other ritual
members, she observed an unknown young man sitting on the left side
of the lodge with LUANA. She presumed that LUANA was designated
to guide the unknown male through the ceremonies and assist him in
taking part in the program.

During the program, the lodge master, TED STEVENS, asked
for volunteers to take part in an experiment and this man was one
of the persons who volunteered to take part in the experiment.

The experiment consisted of placing different objects against the
subject's body and the subject trying to identify the number of
objects that were placed against him. Following the experiment,
the man took a seat on the right side of the lodge. She believes
that another member, SALLY HARDMAN, also was a subject of the
experiment.

She advised that following the meeting, she returned
to the dressing room to remove her robe and when she finished, she
went to the room where refreshments were served but she did not
see the man again.

She stated that following the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY, she saw a picture of SIRHAN SIRHAN on television
and recognized the photograph as being a photograph of the unknown

Miss LUANA ACOB, age 14, 2090 North Reymond Avenue,
Altadene, California, was contacted at her residence and vol-
untarily furnished the following information in the presence
of her mother, Mrs. EMMA JEAN ACOB:

She is ea member of the Ancient Mystical Order of
Rosae Crucis, (AMORC) known as the Rosicrucian Order, and attends
meetings at the Akhnaton Chapter, 2031 East Villa, Pasadena,
California. She is a “Colombe” of the lodge which is a young,
female, virgin member and as such participates in various
rituals of the lodge.

On May 28, 1968, she arrived at the lodge shortly
before 8:00 p.m. and went to the dressing area where she
donned her robe for the lodge ceremonies.She then went to a
lodge anteroom where refreshments are served and the lodge
keeps various books and documents relating to the Rosicrucian
Order. When she came to this room her grandmother, Mrs.
WILAMAY HARRISON, told her there was a new member and offer
to assist him at the meeting. LUANA then noticed the new
member who she described as a Latin appearing male about 20
years old wearing a sportshirt and slacks who she had never
geen before. She said the man was looking through the books
and documents of the Order and appeared to be very interested
in this materiel. She stated she felt too bashful to introduce
herself to the new member and shortly after her grandmother
was talking to the man and called to her to come and meet him.
She went over and her grandmother introduced her to the man
whose name wag SIRHAN SIRHAN. She began talking to the man
and asked him if he had a shorter néme or a nickname and he
said, "No, just call me SIRHAN." She introduced SIRHAN to
some of the other members and they all had trouble pronouncing
his name correctly and this was one of the reasons she asked
if he had another name. SIRHAN told her he had been a member
of the Rosicrucian Order for over one year but he did not know
there was a chapter in Pasadena. She believes that the lodge
master, TED STEVENS, or the lodge inspector, SHERMAN LIVINGSTON,
had previously checked SIRHAN's membership card prior to her
grandmother asking LUANA to assi a ti i
she did not question his membership.
