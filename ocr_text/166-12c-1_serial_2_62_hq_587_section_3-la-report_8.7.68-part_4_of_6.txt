Tne schedule appears to be a proposed schedule made
up prior to the registration of the stucent preparing it. The
room numbers 23C and 35C appear to correspond to room numbers
at Pasadena City College and it is usual for students to take
physical education classes in the gym twice a week. He does
not recognize the schedule as tne kind used at Pasadena
City College but schedules of this type are often available
for students at school book stores and supply centers. The
schedule would have to pertain to a junior ‘college rather’ ~-
than a high school since high school classes are generally

Angeles, California, This woman,’ who identified herself to him
as GLLDERDINE OPPENHEIMER (ph), reportedly told him that
KENNEDY was "no good" and further stated, "They are going to
get him", referring to Senator KENNEDY.

FAHEY further advised that he and OPPENHEIMER had
breakfast together on June 4, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel
Coffee Shop and, during breakfast, he noticed a man at the
entrance to the coffee shop staring at them, He identified
subsequently a photograph of MUNIR SIRHAN as looking like the
individual staring into the coffee Shop, but could not be
positive of his identification, — _

After breakfast, FAHEY told OPPENHEIMER he was
going to Oxnard and she asked if she could accompany him, to
which he agreed. En route to Oxnard, OPPENHEIMER told FAHEY
they were being followed by a dark blue Volkswagen. This
Volkswagen subsequently pulled into a parking area off the
highway and was not seen again, After spending the day in
Oxnard, FAHEY and OPPENHEIMER returned to Los Angeles and
he dropped her off at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately
7:30 P.M., June 4, 1968,

BRUCE A. KOCH, Hamilton Jewelers, 984 Market Street, advised
that he had formerly done business as Fields Jewelers, and recalls
JOHN FAHEY, a jewelry salesman, as being a good worker but at
times appeared to be mentally deranged. FAHEY imagined his co-
workers, as well as superiors, were conspiring against him and
this would build up inside him until he would become violent.
FAHEY would provoke his co-workers and then sometimes assault them.
Further, he had assaulted customers.

After being fired, FAHEY would walk by the store and sometimes
glare in at the employees and point his finger at them, then walk
around the block, return and do the same thing. Other times,
FAHEY would walk by and be friendly, talk to the employees, and
then go about his business.

KOCH stated he believed FAHEY had been confined because of
these mental aberrations but could not furnish the name or loca-
tion of any hospital or institution.

CAMERON JARRETT, Chief Inspector, Auditing and Inspection
Division, Bank of America NT&SA, No. 1 South Van Ness Avenue,
made available the personnel file pertaining to JOHN HENRY FAHEY,
Social Security > which showed that he was employed
by the Bank of America on March 22, 1965, as a Field Collector
for Time Payment Loans at the Auto Center Branch of the bank,
#281, 1640 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco. He voluntarily resigned
as of January 4, 1966. His performance was satisfactory and
honesty unquestioned.

The file showed FAHEY had threatened to quit several times
over something said or done by fellow employees and seemed to take
things personally. He had originally handed in his written resig-
nation on December 17, 1965, to be effective January 15, 1966;
however, due to an argument with his supervisor, he was permitted
to leave January 4, 1966, but was paid to January 15, 1966.

The file also showed the following:

1. FAEEY was beaten up by a delinquent loan customer on
August 13, 1965, and received treatment by ANGELO M. MAY, M.D.,
450 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Injuries were to his groin,
left side, and ribs. The California State Compensation Insurance
Fund, 525 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, handled the claim
under file #A-12143. Apparently FAHEY instituted a civil action
resulting from this injury and was represented by DONALD ANDERSON,
Attorney.

2. On his employment application FAHEY listed his education
as ‘High School ~ North High School, Worcester, Mass., 1939-1944,.!
A letter dated March 29, 1965, from W. K. FRENCH, Principal,
indicated .there was no record of FAHEY ever attending this school.

3. The District Attorney of Alameda County, Family Support
Division, 225 W. Winton Avenue, Room 206, Hayward, California,
wrote to the bank on November 2, 1966, indicating that FAHEY, DA
