"SIRUAN, MeAica of 696 E. Howard St, Pasadena
_ I was contacted by the Mother of McANAT ELY € at the front Lo advi soc
that he Son, along with SIRIAN, had been wissi since 10-29-65, © bey
left to deliver a papor route. She advised ‘ “she and some of the “bo y's frien«
had bsen looking for then since that time & that they had been observe ef in the

area of Los Robles Avenue & Villa Stre be on this date, 10-31-63, in %}
morning hours, by one of the boy's friends. Tne Mother was advised thet when
the Juveniles observed the Friends car, they rano .

The Mother stated that her.son had been going with a girl by the name o3
Karen who lives at 483 E. Villa Street. This relationship is approximately a
week old. Mrse McANALLY stated that she had been advised that the juveniles
stayed in this girls garage last night & that she went to the residence to see
-what she could find out. Phe girls Mother was quite uncooperative and refused
any information. Through some source, the Mother found out that the Juveniles
would be at the Villa Street address at 4:00PM, this detae

. _ Mes. SIRHAN can speak very little English and aske
make the report on her son at the same time. This was 4
under the same case number,

t Mrs. McANALLY
and both carried

fo so

It is possible thet the Mother of Karen was aware that’ the Juveniles
spent the night in the garage & also knew that the Juveniles were minavayse
If this is correct, she may poset bly be in violation of Contrinutings

The Juveniles both attend Elliott Je. High School & Karon attends

Upon my arrival at the above location I contacted GREEN, and she rolated WA
the following: At approx. 12:10 PM this date GREEN was s banding in front of her
hone, when she heard the sound of breaking glass. GRE SEN then obsarved SERUAN
standing on tho sidewalk in front of 1250 N. Sierra Bonita. Upon investigating
GREEN found ROACH in the house at that location.

-

Ne

I contactod SIRHAN who stated that ho, and {ROA CH were on their way to schoc
when ROACH wanted to go into tho "Haunted house". SIRHAN steted that he did not
want to go with ROACH go he waited for him on the sidewalk.

T- contacted ROACH who stated that "ALL tho Idds' at school told him tho hous
was: haunted and that noeone lived thore", ROACH stated that he found an open
wi nd ow 4 ene climbed in. As he entered the building his foot struck a panel or
glass in avcokcasé doooreaking ite

I again contacted GREEN, and she. stated that it is very common for childre:
to enter the bul lding «

At this time I had SIRHAN return. to school, and I acconpanied ROACH honoe
I contacted MC REYNOLDS. who is ROACH'S grandmothar, and Ia dvised her of the
incident. MC REYNOLDS stated that sho would soo that ROACH did nov antor the
houses egein, and that she would take tho necessary dl.sciplinary actions

It is my opinion that this dui. icing shoulda be inspocted by the Building
Dopartnont, and the Fire DDepartment, as there ere sefersil open windows that
juveniles could climb ine

Jes

. It is also my opinion that no follov~-up action nosed be taken towards R
and SIRHAN dao to their couoperative actitude, and the attitude of NC REYNO

On arrival, contacted the ab ove complainant. He advised that he had
purchased the above residence approximately two months ago. Since that time
he has had constant trouble with the ebove suspects, who rent the first floor.
He stated that he asked the suspects to move in one month as he planned on
moving into the ground floor for health purposes. Further, ‘that the suspects
park in an area on the grounds that he is trying to clean up and that he has
asked them not to park there any longer. The susoects continue to park in the
area.

After taliing to the informant, I contacted the suspects. They advised
that they rented the apartment approximately four years ago and at that time,
were advised by the previous owners to park in this area. They further stated
that they could not understand the feelings of the new owner as they had never
had trouble before.

After talking with both parties, I found thet the suspects are in the
process of buying a home, but that it is not out of escrow ané@ will not be for
two to three weeks. At this time, they stated that they would be more than
happy to leave. It was agreed by both parties, that the suspect would continue
to live in the residence for two or three more weeks and would continue to
park in the area.

It was found thet the suspects were most co-operative and by no means
appeared to be pcople who would cause any disturbance. It is felt that one ew
situationismtually acceptable to both parties for the time being & no furth
action was felt necessary o
