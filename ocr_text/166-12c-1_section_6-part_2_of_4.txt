April 22,1969.

Hon. John N.Mitchell,
United States Attorney Seneral,
Washington,D.c.

Dear Sir:

I am enclosing another news item that aroused our little neigh-
borhood group called "Common Sense Seekers” to gather at my hacienda to
discuss over a few beers,etc. this latest decision of the United “tates
Supreme Court,since we are vitally interested in law enforcement with
JUSTICE,but in our studied opinion, these Street and watts decisions has

about reached the bottom.

There have of course ween other decisions during the last several
years with respect to their philosophy and understanding of the Consti-
tution that always appear to favor those who commit the crimes and forget
the innocent victims or decisions that may discowrage or prevent crime?

We have also concluded that no matter what your department or
Congress adopt as laws to prevent crimes, the Supreme Court will, through
nit-picking opinions nullify on mere technicalities’ even though minute,
as contrary to certain amendments to the Constitution that was adopted
over a century ago without appreciation or understanding by those honorable
and respected forefathers of what is going on now.

How could those men understand or realize the great progress and
advancements in our social,electronic,science,space,medical,e i
field and are we to be denied the necessary tools wit
nation is confronted with?

This latest reversal is shocking to an average layman as it

to us when they chose "to not rule on the cons titutionality, * 3 the
make 8 crime to destroy the American Fleg,but ups PAR EZ aN aged of ja

defendant ,who denounced the Flag and publicly sqt fire to it in J
1966,convicted but now reversed as it was contrar tg, the Jaret, Amen

ment????
Even though they upheld the constitutionality of the 1917 federal

law against threatening the life of the President but threw out by a
narrow vote of 5 to 4,that she Waste “threat” was merely "political hyper-

pole”. (which means more or less than the truth)???

If such "threats" uttered publicly that he was going to refuse to
be drafted and added,"if they ever make me carry a rifle,the first man I
want to get in my sights is IBJ,etc." while LBJ wag then our president,
then yelling fire in a theatre is "childish hyperbole” even though very —
dangerous end final result not known.

If the above reasoning by our highest court through the useage

ied phraseology as "political erbole", probably coined by .
of, such Tope inking law clark, then Sirhan Sirhan usea political hyperbole"

er mahaged to complete his political hatred by murdering Senator
dy as he wrote his intentions.

Hon. John yewi @eo11,2: e

We have been very fortunate in LosAngeles “ounty to have a very
efficient District Attorney,Evelle Younger and his staff who have
prosecuted Sirhan Sirhan against great odds,against competent and
prominent defense counsel,a string of psychiatrists,some of whom be-
came & bit mixed up on the stand with a great display of sympathy
for the accused even mentjoning the effects the Jury's decision
would have in every precinct in the Arab countries and the world.

We thank God and the staff of the LosAngeles County District
Attorney for their determination to render Justice in this case as
we await the final penalty decision of the jury as to whether life
or death,and,it is my hope that while I favor the death penalty in
this case,I fear continuous appeals to the United States “upreme
or California Supreme Yourts,similear to the notorious Chessman
trials would finally result in a reversal on some nitpicking basis.

Yes,Mr.“itchell our little group 1s becoming disturbed about what
is going in our higher courts especially as they seem to find some
technical errogs or their conception of the Const&tution's meaning
without a proper evaluation of the effect their decisions are having
om society in general or protection of that society,particularly so
when they make their findings retrosctive.

Of course it is possible that we lay people are away out of line

and we discussed that possibility too,but when groups of criminals

ean devise ways and means to beat the laws with immunity,using
every conceivable tactic to carry on their crimes,we do not subscribe
to the theory to deny the kaw enforcement agenciesequal or superior
facilities of detection as we are certain that the framers of the
Constitution re in mind, Hoffa case is another question?

If it takes a jury composed of twelve men and women after personal
observation of counsel, defendant,witnesses and judge, to agree on a
verdict unanimously in criminal cases, then by a mere vote of ONE in
majority in higher courts can nullify such decisions does not seem
fair or proper,as in our opinion, those members are not super-dunera
although long occupancy and age may convince certain members of their
invincibility,or being untouchable.

I am sure your short occupancy in the department of justice has
opened an entirely new era to you and your staff,as I am personally
and my beliefs are shared by my neighbors that it is about time that
those in power in this country had better to begin to make more than
a study of what is going on within our courts ,legel fraternity and
especial reference to the U.S.Supreme ourt,as even tho we suspect
that a majority of the judiciary are opposed to the penalty of Capi-
tal punishment,but neverpthe-less permit more than men in the
“alifornia prison await their final decisions.

DEAR SIR:

IS IT TRUE THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS THINKING OF MAKING A DEAL WITH
THE COUNTRY OF JORDAN TO revease rr SIRHAN \CUPON CONVICTION) TO THEM FOR AN
EXCHANGE OF SOMEONE? IF SO, WHO IS THAT SOMEONE THAT HE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

THE MURDERER OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY?

THE SHOCKING FACT THAT SIRHAN SIRHAN HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED A "HERO" IN THE
ARAB STATES FOR KILLING A HUMAN BEING IN COLD BLOOD WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR ME
TO BEAR, BUT THEN UPON LEARNING THE NEWS THAT THE JUSTIC DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED |
STATES OF AMERICA WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERING A DEAL TO GIVE HIM BACK TO JORDAN FILLS
ME WITH SUCH DISGUST AND CONTEMPT FOR MY COUNTRY THAT I HAD TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER
AND ASK THIS QUESTION: WILL HE BE SENT TO A JORDANIAN PRISON OR BE ALLOWED TO

WALK THE STREETS AND ENJOY THE FRUITS OF HIS MOST HORRIBLE DEED?

NO MATTER WHAT, LETS FORGET THE OIL THAT IS IN JORDAN, LETS FORGET THE MIDDLE
a
EAST CRISIS CBECAUSE IT WILL ERUPT ANYWAY) AND LET US SAVE AMERICAS LITTLE PRECIOUS

DIGNITY THAT SHE HAS LEFT AND NOT PERFORM SUCH A DISGUSTING ACT.

AS AN AMERICAN, AS A TAXPAYER, AS A SIMPLE HUMAN BEING, I DEPLORE THE JUSTICE

DEPARTMENT FOR EVEN CONSIDERING SUCH AN INJUSTICE. MORE WORDS FAIL ME.

Nothing Short of Life in Prison
Sirhan Deserves It, D

LOS ANGELES (AP) — ‘Whether Mr,
Sirhan likes it or not,” thundered Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan’s own lawyer, “he
deserves to spend the rest of his life in a
penitentiary.”

Ignoring Sirhan’s hurt gaze, Grant B.
Cooper looked intently at the jury trying
his young client for murder and said:
“We are not here to free a guilty man.
We tell you, as we always have, that he
killed Robert Kennedy.”

Cooper thus began Thursday the last
part of a three-man defense’ summation
in Sirhan’s lengthy trial. He resumes the

-summation today.

“T for one am not going to ask you to
do more than bring in a verdict of
murder in the second degree,” said
Cooper.

‘The penalty for second-degree murder

"in Californis is a sentence of five years to

life, with the exact term and’ parole

eligibility determined later by the Adult’
Authority. The state is asking a verdict .

of first-degree murder but not neces-
sarily the death penalty,’ which is the
only alternative to life in perison,

“THE JURY MAKES the choice on a
conviction of first-degree murder and.a

-prisoner sentenced to life is not eligible .

for parole for seven years. jj .
~“¥ wouldn’t want Sirhan Sirhan turned

loose on society when the psychiatrists
tell us he is getting worse and he is going
to get worse,” Cooper said. ‘There is a

good Sirhan and a bad Sirhan and that”

bad Sirhan is a nasty Sirhan..

“Thave learned to love the little good

The dark, curly-haired ‘Jordanian
pallid from more than 10 months in a
sunless prison cell, smiled at that.

But his face became sullen again when
Cooper quoted now-familiar passages

written in Sirhan’s dairy before the .

slaying, asking each time: “Is that
mature ‘thinking? Is that meaningful
thinking?” :

- MOTIVE, said Cooper as he launched
into'a lengthy explanation of the law, ‘‘is
not an element of the crime charged and
need not bd ‘shown,’ but can be
considered as a cricumstance in the
case. oy

“Can there be any question in anyone’s
mind that. Sirhan’s motive was

political?” he asked. ““Thoiigh the motive
was, political, was it a healthy motive?
Obviously the motive in killing any.

“case”

mature motive?”

That, he said, is “‘the guts of the whole
— whether Sirhan’s mental
capacity was so reduced that it affected
his ability “to form, any of the following
specifics — intent to kill, premeditation
and deliberation and ... to reflect on
the gravity of his contemplated act.”

AND THEN Cooper made one of the
few personal references to the victim
heard in 14 weeks of trial.

“I have not overlooked that the man
who was killed was Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy who left a wife and 11 children,
one who was born after his death,”.
Cooper said. ;

And, in a voice tinged with astonish-
ment, the white-haired attorney gesturéd
toward Sirhan, sitting at thé far end of .
the counsel table:

“He believed he was right. How
stupid? He believed he shouldn’t be

Seferring to previous correspondence regarding Law Enforcement
with Justice,I am enclosing snother news item rather proves that too
many of our coirts are using and exercising their ow philosophy when
they overturn lower court decisions time after time,as in this partic.
ular case.

Year Sir:

It should be obvious to the courts that this pemon isa ~ ind |
dangerous person who has committed cruel and vicious crimes bat never-
the-less,instead of confining him, they nit-~pick the thinking and
decisions of other courts who heard evidence st first hand, studied
the defendant but seem to find something to reverse.

Moe?

No wonder law enforcement agencies are becoming frustrated
when they are confsonted with such repested reversals,especially when
the higher courts make their decision based on their own recent
thinking and not whet the law was at time of crimes.

So,I appeal to you “r.“dtchell when your commission is making
a study of lew enforcement with justice,and when future members of the
U.S. Supreme ‘ourt are appointed, they shouad leave their own prejudices
behind them since it is becoming a matter of liberalism and conservat-
ism,as especially one of the members seeme to be that no one can do
wrong,so let em go on their way.

Why ere we having so many early retirements from our law .. |
enforcement agencies? Because every block is placed against them
in investigations,depriving them of the necessary tools to gather
evidence while the criminals use anything at hand and get away with

Many of our citizens are becoming plain disgusted,sick anc
tired with what is going on as in this particular case,there is no
question of the defendant being guilty but what can the courts do to
continue trial after trial and ignoring the plain facts,especially
when such dangerous characters should be confined.

Now,we are going through a trial et is almost at an end in

Slayer of 3 Wins
Right to Retrial,
Penalty Hearing

BY GENE BLAKE
Times Staff Writer

A triple killer who made legal
history five years ago in a death
penalty reversal has been granted a
new trial for two 1962 murders and
a new penalty hearing in a 1964
slaying.

The California Supreme Court
reversed the conviction of Joseph
Bernard Morse, 25, for the fatal
bludgeoning of his mother and
invalid sister in their Chula Vista
home.

And the court invalidated a death
penalty decreed for Morse in the
strangling of a fellow prisoner in the |
San Diego County Jail.

In deciding the two cases, the six
justices were divided sharply with —
six separate written opinions total-
ing 91 pages.

Morse was 18 when he used a rock
and a baseball bat to beat to death
his. widowed mother, Mrs. Hope

Morse, 58, and his sister Jennifer, 12,
a vietity of cystic HBROSIEY* > b xecrs ~

He made two detailed confessions.
In the second, the Supreme Court

~ said, he "described with dispassion-

ate particularity the background
and execution of the crimes and
exposed them as a caldly calculated
expression of accumulated rage."
Morse was quickly convicted and
sentenced to death. But in 1964, in a
precedent-shattering decision, the
State Supreme Court reversed the

_ death penalty. ~

The court:said then the jury had
been improperly advised that it
could consider Morse would be eli- |
gible for parole in. seven years if
given a life sentence:

Jtrors should be instructed that

final without appeal.

may be a little, mad, his
cars are bargains at the
price, always lower than
what the buyer says he'll

ay.
P ie is this kind of sweet-
negs and light, the reverse
of man's native greed and

vulgarity --so_- prevalent °
now in the Sick Sixties, -

that generates'a smile and
a friendly reception for
"Of Angels and Eskimos,"
which is far from flawless,
even a mite amateurish in
a literary sense.

In other words, Mandel
is no Neil Simon when it
comes to ‘writing -witty,
indelible lines and con-
structing airtight plots.
What he has going for him
here, awkwardness not-
withstanding, is a raffish
comedy sense and an opti-

mistic. spirit, both as re- |

. freshing

for a change ‘as a
glass’o

spting water. |

The Honorable Richard M, Nixon
President of the United States
The White House

Washington, D. C.

Dear President Nixon:

We were deeply moved by the Bulogy you gave in behalf
of "Ike, We were proud you are our President, and
the words you spoke in his behalf were appreciated
by the world I am sure,

We recently read an article in the San Diego Union
stating that "a three-cell suite is being built for
Sirhan...at a state medical facility.,.",

We were shocked, disgusted, and angered by this news,
Since this particular crime was committed "beyond
the shadow of a doubt" before numerous witnesses,
punishment should have been swift and sure, and if
the laws were upheld (those of the Constitution as
our forefathers wrote them) it shouldn't have taken
longer than 24 hours for the sentence to be carried
out,

We love our country and are proud to be able to
contribute to its support through our taxes, As an
ex-service family of.23 years, we get "fighting mad"
at this judicial farce that is going on for Sirhan

at our expense, We strongly protest the molly-
coddling of criminals. Something is drastically wrong
with a judicial system where justice is not the prime
concern, but where the defense is allowed to "win at
any cost" and at the taxpayer's expense, and at the
decent people's terror when they are released on
technicalities,

We appreciate your efforts to bring this country back
to a set of moral values where we can be proud to

be Americans,
Respectfully yours,

MRS, V J, CRAVENS

MEMORANDUM TO ALL EMPLOYEES

SUBJECT: Tetanus or "Lockjaw" Inmunization Program

A tetanus immunization program is recommended by the Public
Health Service of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

Tetanus can result from any injury, including nail punctures,
insect bites, splinters, burns and lacerations. There is no known
cure for tetanus which has one of the highest fatality rates of all
infections.

Tetanus can be prevented by the tetanus toxoid immunization,
which is 99.9% effective if the immmization series is completed
and booster injections given as directed. The tetanus antitoxin
which must be given to persons who have been injured and who have
not had the immunization can result in a dangerous allergic reaction.

The complete series of the tetanus toxoid immunization program
consists of:

(1) First injection

(2) Second injection given 4 to 6 weeks after the first
injection

(3) Third injection - one year after the second injection.

(4) Booster injections should be given after an injury
regardless of the time lapse since the last injection.

(5) To maintain immnity a booster injection should be
given every 5 years.

The Department will administer a tetanus immunization program
at a charge of 25 cents per inoculation to cover the necessary costs.
If you are interested in participating in the program, complete the
form appearing below, detach and forward to the Health Unit, Room 2305,
Main Building. Detailed plans for the administration of the program

‘Being Prepared
|For Sirhan

By DONALD H. HARRISON

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A
suite of three cells—complete
with living and dining quarters
and a television set—is being
built for Sirhan Bishara Sirhan
in case the young Jordanian is
“leonvicted of assassinating Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy.

The California Department of
Corrections wants Sirhan to
stay in the special extra-secure
cell whether he gets life impris-
onment or the death penalty.

“Tf he’s convicted,” a Correc-
tions Department officer said,
j-| “There’s always the chance that
some inmate would try to kill
him. We've spent about $5,000 to
remodel his section so he'll
never come into contact ‘with
other prisoners.”

The walled-off suite of cells is
being prepared at the California|
Medical Facility at Vacaville,
near Sacramento. A bill pending
in the California Legislature
would permit Sirhan, if sen-
tenced to death, to stay there
rather than at San Quentin’s
death row as is now required.

_{ Sirhan’s trial, starting its 13th
"| week, was recessed Friday until

Tuesday with rebuttal witnesses
for the prosecution on the stand.
;|The defense has rested its case

with testimony that Sirhan did

not meaningfully premeditate
e-|the assassination in Los Angeles

last June 5.
is-| Phil Guthrie, the corrections’
dis|officer, said preparations for
ob-|Sirhan’s incarceration were
ing|being made in advance of a ver-
ith|dict because “we'd get him
within days after sentencing.”
If the jury convicts Sirhan of
first-degree murder, it will de-
cide the penalty—death or life/f

Sirhan would be confined to
three adjoining _cells—eagh|
reg| about 10 by 15 feet. In one would
lhe a kitchen with a stainless
steel stove where uniformed

would cook Sirhan’s
