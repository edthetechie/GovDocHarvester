Honorable John N, Mitchell
Attorney General of the United States
Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Dear General Mitchell: a8 ns op
In re: Sirhan B. Sirhan 8 Pg

Subsequent to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the staff
of this office, together with the Los Angeles Police Department and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, conducted an extensive investigation into
the possible existence of a criminal conspiracy in connection with the
Senator's death.

The conclusion from this investigation was and is that there was no con-
spiracy and that Sirhan B. Sirhan acted alone.

As might be expected in a case involving nationwide publicity, certain
authors are currently attempting to suggest that a conspiracy did in fact
exist. Mr. Robert Kaiser, ina book, "RFK Must Die," suggests that
Sirhan was a ''Manchurian Candidate ,'' computerized to assassinate

Senator Kennedy.

One free lance reporter has advanced a theory that Sirhan was assisted in
the assassination by a right wing security guard on duty at the Ambassador

Hotel on the night of the assassination.

This letter is to inform you that this office is aware of these persons and
their theories involving a purported conspiracy. The policy of this office
is to investigate and evaluate all information suggesting a conspiracy.

To date, the theories advanced by these individuals have neither suggested
new evidence nor altered the conclusion heretofore stated.

President Nixon

“ashington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

It is still quite a while before the presidentiad
‘campaign, but I think we should not saddle the people with

jthe cost of providing special guards for the presidential
jeanditates. Of course right after Robert Kennedy was assinated
there was quite an uproar. But you know Robert Kennedy did
have a life guard and it didn't do him any food.

t

And about these North Vietnamese why cant some one accidently

i get one of those bombs we used on Japan and use it on them?
| They arn't really people are the y? They are just war mongers.

Sincerely

eet

‘Dear Mrs. Hoffman:

- President Nixon has referred to this Department
your letter, dated May 23, 1970, regarding Sirhan
Sirhan and Jack Ruby. Please excuse the delay of
this response.

While the federal government is of course ee
concerned about the cases in which these nem were avs
tried, it has -no general jurisdiction regarding the: —

exime of murder, with which each was. charged; instead, |

trials for murder are generally held in state court

and prosecuted by state officials. The questions

raised in your letter are therefore matters vise

the primary jurisdiction of state authorities

California and Texas and inquiries regarding the

disposition of these cases should be sent to thes for

appropriate Fesponse.

Dear President Nixon;
I am an 8th grade student at Margaret Mace Junior High

School in North Wildwood, New Jersey. Today during our
History class the discussion came up about Sirhan Sirhan

and why he is given special privileges such as an over-sized
cell and a color television. I have read in the newspapers
that this man has been found guilty of killing Senator

Robert F, Kennedy. There is no reason why he should get these
privileges while no one else does. Everyone in my classroom
is concerned and I am sure that we are not the only ones

that wonder why he is given these special privileges. My
class and I would be very grateful if this letter would be

answered,
Thank You

Sincerely Yours,

Dear iir. Nixon,

Although I am only a girl of 15 years,
I think that a lot of people feel as

I do. Sirhan should be brought to jus-
tice.

I admired Bobby Kennedy very much, and

I feel that a great injustice has been

done to his family and to the American
people by letting him live even this

long.

I think that the law is at fault.

Can't somethin, be done about it? Through
it, many guilty men have been allowed to

go free , because of many of the appeals
they made, wnen they snould haye been .
dead long ago. 7 ‘ c oS
I have talked to tiy father about it, and
asked hin to write an editorial on it, but
what he says is true; it wouldn't accompli
sa anything. CAV,

I know that you couldn't directly intluence,
the courts, but you could help by avpoint-

ing better judges who would get @
