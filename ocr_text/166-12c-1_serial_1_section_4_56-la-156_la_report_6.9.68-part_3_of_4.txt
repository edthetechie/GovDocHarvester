CROWE states there is no way that SIRHAN could
know the other; seven members of his CP Club and noted that
he has not told SIRHAN. Further CROWE said he does not
walk the streets recruiting CP members and for that matter
based on STRHAN's prior lack of interest in the SDS would
not and could not have recruited him for the CP at this
time. CROWE says that recruitment would have to follow
overt activities on the part of SIRHAN over an extended
period of time; like membership in a club like the W.E.B.
Du Bois Club that CROWE was in. -Since this background was
lacking in STRHAN, CROWE could not recruit him and did
not try.

CROWE states that of the hour between 8 p.m.,
and 9 p.m., when they talked, the discussion of CP
activity, inéluding the W.E. B. Du Bois Club took about
twenty minutes, At about 9 p.m., two other former students
whom CROWE recognized but whose nanes he absolutely does
not know and never knew, came into Bob's Restaurant. He
stated Bob’s is the restaurant adjacent to Pasadena City
College and is|frequented regularly by students as a hang-
out. These two former students joined CROWE and SIRHAN
both of whom recognized both of them and vice versa. At
this point CROWE discontinued all efforts to discuss any-
thing personal with SIRHAN since he and SIRHAN were out "on
the town" for the evening. The other two students decided
to join in and'they left Bob's going to a topless bar
across the street from Dow Radio on East Colorado Boulevard
in Pasadena. They next went to a topless restaurant on
Foothill Boulevard in the eastern part of Pasadena, named
the Black Cat. | After a very few beers in both bars they all
went to Ernies |Taco Restaurant on Colorado near Fair Oaks in
Pasadena, had some Mexican food, split up, the two others
going off together and he and SIRHAN going their separate
ways. CROWE dia not see, talk to or communicate with SIRHAN
in any way, directly or indirectly since that time.

CROWE states he is "aware of the awful" implications
of his contact with SIRHAN, He has seen a Los Angeles news-
paper account of an interview of Mayor SAM YORTY since the
murder of Senator * KENNEDY wherein YORTY make reference to

- 1ole -

(rhm, Jr. /vaa)

notes that once belonged to SIRHAN which suggest that
SIRHAN believes in the objectives of the Communist Party.
CROWE "hopes to God" that dates on these notes are prior
to his talk with SIRHAN on May 2, 1968. CROWE states
this matter weighs heavily on his conscience. He hopes
he did not influence SIRHAN to shoot Senator KENNEDY. He
cannot believe that his brief remarks to SIRHAN could be
the motivation, but since he does not know of anyone
else who contacts STRHAN, knows only of his own contact,
he has an ache in the pit of his stomach when he thinks
of the consequences. He says he is examining his own
conscience searching for an answer; he says he has a
"dreadful" fear that he might be responsible for this
shooting which he states must be considered one of the
crimes of the century.

CROWE cannot think of any way in which to
further clarify his feelings or enlighten this investigation.
He says he is always available for recontact and interview
further at any time and he was told he would be recontacted
and reinterviewed.

CROWE states he never discussed the current
political scene in the United States with SIRHAN on their
May 2, 1968, meeting and never discussed Senator KENNEDY
or any candidates in the California primary with SIRHAN.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TO ABOLISH
THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
COMMITTEE, Also Known As
Abolition of the House Un-American
Activities Committee, Citizens Committee
____to Preserve American Freedoms

A source advised on January 25, 1966, that the
Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms, (CCPAF) _
555 North Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, had recently
changed its name to Southern Californians for Abolition of
the House Un-American Activities Committee.

The same source advised on May 11, 1967, that
subsequent to the adoption of the new name in January, 1966,
the officers began to refer to it by the name Southern
Californians to Abolish the House Un-American Activities
Committee. This is now the official name and the letterhead
of the organization carries the name as "Southern Californians
to Abolish HUAC".

The "Guide to Subversive Organizations", revised
December 1, 1961, pp. 43-44, describes the CCPAF as follows:

"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American
Freedoms * * * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing
the Committee on Un-American Activities and discrediting
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Created in Los Angeles
in 1952, the front organization is run by FRANK WILKINSON,
an identified Communist who recently resumed the full-time,
paid post of executive secretary after approximately a
year's leave of absence to assist in a similar campaign by
another front in New York City, the Emergency Civil Liberties
Committee.

"fren the Committee ou Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles, September 2-5, 1958, to inquire
into the nature of the Party's recent reorganization in
California, the Citizens Committee tc Preserve American
Freedoms sponsored a series of public meetings to protest
the hearings and the very existence of the Committee.
Communists subpoenaed as witnesses were guests of honor.

"At this time, leaders of the Party's Southern
California District were mobilizing Communists in the area .
for participation in an intensified campaign to abolish
this committee of Congress. How the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms served the Party in this effort
was revealed by (Communist Party) District Chairman DOROTHY
HEALEY in a report to the Party's Southern California
District Council on September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY declared
that the Party preferred public protest meetings to be held
by the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather
than under party auspices because Communists could attend
without danger of being exposed as members of the Party.

She also noted that Communists scheduled as congressional
‘committee witnesses could not appear beforshand at open
Communist rallies without creating the impression that the
Party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold information
from the committee."

ist Street, was contacted at his place of employment, the
Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard. After being
advised of the identity of the contacting agent, he was
interviewed regarding his observance of a 1959 white
Chevrolet on the night of June 4, 1968.

BEN-JABR advised he is employed part tiie as a
parking lot attendant at the Ambassador Hotel and, on the
night of June 4, 1958, was stationed at a point in the hotel
parking lot which ig located approximately 150 feet due west
of the main hotel entrance. At approximately 11:00 or .
11:30 P.M., a 1959 white Chevrolet occupied by four males
pulled to a stop where he was standing and the driver asked
him where he could park his car. BEN-+-JABR stated at that
time the front narking lot was full due to the activity
of the KENNEDY campaign people in the Embassy Room of the
hotel. He instructed the driver to continue through the
tunnel located on the west side of the hotel in the direction
of 8th Street and told thé. driver of ‘this automobile’ that -he
would probably have to find private parking in that area.
The driver did as he instructed.

Approximately 20 minues to a half hour later, he
observed the driver of this automobile in the company of a
woman entering the main entrance of the hotel. The woman
was not in the car when it had passed BEN-JABR earlier. The
couple entered the hotel through the main lobby. The three
other individuals who had been in the automobile with the
driver were not observed by BEN-JABR.

Regarding the driver of the white 1959 Chevrolet,
BEN-JABR advised that, as the car approached him initially,
he observed one other passenger in the front seat and two
passengers in the rear seat of this automobile. To the best
of hig recollection, he thought the car was a two-door sedan
but could not recall anything significant about it, such as
dents, paint scratches, or decals in the windows.

hands with him. As the driver spoke, BEN-JABR noticed that
he had an Arabic accent. He asked the driver where he was
from and was informed that the driver was from Lebanon.

was from.

BEN-JABR deseribed the driver as being in his
mid-20s, about 6' in height, straight light brown hair,

On June 6, 1968, information was received from the
Las Vegas Office that an individual had contacted that office
and advised that they knew an individual by the name of
SIRHAN SATLEN SIRHAN, who resided at 1211 Hubbard Street,
Detroit, Michigan, who closely resembled the picture of
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, who allegedly shot Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY, This party indicated that SIRHAN SATLEN SIRHAN
was older than the assailant but that because of the strong
physical resemblance, she thought that they might be related.

Also on June 5, 1968, information was received from
the Kansas City Office reflecting that EDDIE A, STRHAN
was arrested by the St. Louis Police Department in 1958 and
was subsequently turned over to the Detroit Police Department.

Investigation conducted at Detroit, reflects that
SALIEM and MARY SIRHAN resided at 1211 Hubbard Street,
Detroit, Michigan, They have four sons, SAMMIE, residence
Porter, Michigan; TEWFIC (TOM), residence Dearborn Heights,
Michigan; SAM, residence Hazel Park; and SIRHAN and wife,
NELLIE, residence Green Street, Detroit. Investigation
conducted at Detroit, fails to disclose that these persons
are related to SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

The records of the Detroit Police Department failed
to reflect an arrest of EDDIE A, SIRHAN by the St. Louis
Police with a subsequent turn over to Detroit Police Department
in May 1958. The records of the Detroit Police Department
do show an arrest of ADEL AID SIRHAN, also known as Eddie
Sirhan on November 9, 1950 for "Investigation of molesting
a woman,” This case was dismissed November 10, 1950.
Residence of ADEL AID SIRHAN is shown as 1211 Hubbard,
Detroit, The same individual was also arrested on January 1,
1968, in a gambling raid but was released and no prosecution
was executed, ADEL (EDDIE) A, SIRHAN is the nephew of SALIEM
and MARY SIRHAN. SIRHAN SIRHAN and his wife, NELLIE resided
at 2505 Green Street, Detroit, and is employed at the Excello
Corporation, Walled Lake, Michigan. NELLIE SIRHAN advised
that SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN is completely unfamiliar to her
and her husband.

solicitor at the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters, located at 5615
Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.

WOOD stated that at approximately 2:00 p.m., on
June 3, 1968, while seated at a table in the telephone
soliciting area, his attention was directed to a conversation
which was taking place between two individuals seated directly
behind him. The conversation was being spoken in a dialect
of the Arabic language which WOOD said he was able to interpret.
He explained that he is a geologist and has spent several
years in the mid-East in water exploration and has been employed
by several companies as a groundvater geologist.

WOOD stated that through the course of his employment
in the mid-East, he has obtained a practical working knowledge
of the Arabic language but admitted that he has never received
any formal training regarding the language and, therefore, is
not fully able to interpret the language with regard to proper
tenses and sentence structure. WOOD said that with regard to
the above conversation he interpreted its meaning in Arabic to
pe as follows:

“Well, we didn't catch up with him last
night, but we should tonight.

WOOD stated that as best he could explain, the
conversation was spoken in a dialect which he associated with
the area surrounding Beirut, Lebanon. He added that he is not
by any means an expert on the Arabic language or its
dialects and ig not at all positive regarding the origin of the

WOOD advised that upon hearing the conversation,
he turned in an attempt to see who was speaking but by the
time he did so, the conversation had ceased. He was, therefore,
unable to determine “hich of the two individuals seated behind
him made the statement, but recalls that the statement "ias made
from one person to another and vas not spoken over the telephone.
He also observed that neither individual made any expression
or indication which would indicate the speaker. He noted,
however, that due to the extensive noise in the telephone
soliciting area he vas unable to hear conversations fron
individuals sitting a short distance from him, and therefore is
quite sure that the conversation came from one of the two
individuals seated directly behind hin.

WOOD stated that in resard to the t:0 individuals
seated behind him he believes that they only worked at KENNEDY
Headquarters on June 2, 1968, and June 3, 1968. He said that
sometime during this two day period of time, one of the
individuals whomhe described as bearing a strong resemblance
to the movie actor OMAR SHARIF, asked hin for a cigarette in
a very distinct English voice. WOOD said in recalling the
Arabic conversation and the request regarding the cigarette,
he noticed that they were not anything in the same pitch
voice, adding that the cigarette request vas a very high pitch
voice whereas the Arabic conversation vas of a lover p&tch. .

WOOD recalled that he only overheard the previously
described conversation and did not hear any other conversations
in Arabic during the vime that he vas employed at KENNEDY
Headquarters, and, in fact, dic not hear any other conversations
betiveen the individuals seated behind him.

“OOD was displayed a group of photographs including
a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Departiment
Booking Number 495 139, hovever, WOOD vas unable to identity
any of the photographs as being identical to the individuals
who were seated behind him at KENNEDY Headquarters. WOOD was

WOOD advised that he is formerly from Seward,
Nebraska, and received a formal education in the field of geology
being involved in water exploration. He said he has been
employed by numerous companies in both the United States and the
Middle East, and has travelled extensively in pursuit of his
occupation. WOOD advised that he is presently divorced and
has resided in the Los Angeles area since April, 1968.

WOOD stated that he has never been treated for any
type of mental disorder and does not have a criminal record.
He stated he recently gained employment with Donald K. Warren
Company, Engineers, Los Angeles, Celifornia, and intends to
remain in the Los Angeles area developing water wells for his
employer.

With regard to the above conversation in Arabic,
WOOD attributed little significance to the statement until he
learned of the assassination of ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and did not
feel it was necessary to make this information known to the
public authorities. He added that he has no way of evaluating
this remark ag to its intended meaning or use. WOOD stated
that he is not attempting to seek publicity by making this
information known and has no intention of divulging this
information to the press media. WOOD stated that he did.
furnish the above information to the Los Angeles Police
Department earlier on this date.

At 7:00 p.m. on June 6, 1968, Mr, JOHN FAHEY

Cal Tek Industries as an outside salesman from 1833 North
Eastern Avenue, Los Angeles, California, (phone 268-5137).
He resides at 1030 North Harper Avenue, Apartment 4, Los
Angeles, California, (phone 654-2464). He requested that

status.

He stated he had a business appointment at 8:30 a.m.
on June 4, 1968, to meet a fellow salesman, REG WHITE, who
works for the same company at the Ambassador Hotel. He arrived
about 9:00 a.m., and walked through the arcade area of the
hotel, looking for WHITE, but did not locate him. At this
point, he stated he recalled passing two men on the way into
the hotel from the rear, from Eighth Street, who were also
walking toward the hotel. The men were dressed in casual
clothes, and he assumed they worked there, and only glanced
at them. As he was looking into a shop window in the arcade,
he observed a blonde woman looking into the window, and spoke
to her about the dresses in the window. A casual conversation
ensued, and she then asked if he knew where the Post Office
was. He did not, so she asked another man, who directed her
to the Post Office in the hotel. He did not see the woman
again until he was seated at the counter in the hotel coffee
shop, when she came in, sat down beside him, and started to
talk to him. He offered to buy her breakfast, she agreed,
and they moved to a booth. She ordered a full breakfast; he.

her she could, and she finally told him her name was GILDERDINE

and spoke to her in a few German words. She said she did not
understand German, but spoke English and Arabic. She stated

she changed her story,.saying she was from New York.

She also indicated she had traveled extensively, saying she

had just come from Eilat, Beirut, 4nd. Cairo, She kept .changing
her stories in the course of the day. She stated she had a
problem and needed to talk to someone, She said she had to

get out of the country, wanting to go to Australia. She said
she wanted to leave right away. She asked if he could get her
a passport, and he stated he knew nothing about passports.

She indicated experience with.passports, stating she knew how
to change pictures and names, to obtain the Social Security
Number of a deceased person, get a birth certificate, and then
obtain a passport, She asked if he had connections in
Australia, and he said he did not. She indicated she wanted

to go to Australia alone. When he asked what trouble she was
in, she kept repeating that she did not want to get him
involved. He asked if she lived in the hotel, and she stated
she did not. She asked his preference in a presidential
candidate, and he refused to tell her. She stated KENNEDY

was "no good", and he replied, hoping to draw her out, that

it did not matter to him, as he was for MC CARTHY. She then
stated, "They are going to get him", referring to Senator
KENNEDY. At this time, the woman stated they were being watched.
FAHEY Looked toward the entrance of the coffee shop, and saw
one of the two men he had passed coming into the hotel, staring
intently at them. The man did not stop staring when he looked,
FAHEY stated when he first saw the picture of SIRHAN SIRHAN on
television, he believed it was the man staring at them. Upon
being shown photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN and his brother, MUNIR
SIRHAN, he stated the photograph of MUNIR looked more like the
man staring at them because of the youthful, thin face, but he
could not identify the photograph of MUNIR to be the man who
was staring at them. During the time they were in the restaurant,
the man remained in the doorway, staring at them. When FAHEY
told the woman he was a salesman and was going to Oxnard, the
woman stated she wanted to go with him for the day, and FAHEY,
believing he might find out the woman's problem, agreed. The
woman asked if he was going to attend the “victory reception"
in the hotel that night, and he said no. She stated, "If you

come, you will be really surprised. They are going to take
care of KENNEDY", FAHEY asked her how she knew, and she
stated she did not want him to be involved.

FAHEY and the woman left the hotel, and he took Coast
Highway 101, through Malibu, toward Oxnard. The woman kept
looking behind and acting nervous, and He then noticed that
her hands were wet with perspiration. She stated someone was
following them, and FAHEY then noticed a dark blue Volkswagen
sedan following them. The car had California license plates,
the number of which he did not obtain. FAHEY then began
varying his speed, and concluded they were being followed.

He came to an area in the highway with a curve, and a parking
area on the left hand side with two large boulders on it.

He turned into this area and waited, and when the Volkswagen
appeared, it pulled into the parking area about fifty feet

to his left. He looked out his window at the male driver,
and the man stared back at him. The. driver then backed the
Volkswagen behind the boulder on the left, out of sight.
FAHEY decided he should leave, and departed going north
toward Oxnard. They did not see the Volkswagen again. While
driving, in the conversation, attempting to establish "their"
numbers (the size of the group), she mentioned that "they"
used radios to communicate between themselves. Nothing
further was said about this, but FAHEY became worried,
fearing foul play of some sort. He asked her if she belonged
to a group, and she replied "once you get involved, you
belong or they take care of you". FAHEY began thinking of
returning her to Los Angeles, and asked her where she lived.
She stated she lived on Kenmore, but had only lived there

two or three days. He got the feeling she was not from the
area, and was passing through Los Angeles. FAHEY drove to
Oxnard and Ventura with the woman. On their return to

Los Angeles, they stopped at a restaurant on the east side

- of the highway, between Oxnard and Malibu. He did not recall
the name of the restaurant, but it began with the letters
"Tran---" (Trancas). They ate at approximately 5:15 p.m.

The woman stated she had a long night ahead of her. She wanted
a drink, but he refused to buy her a drink, as he did not want
to drink with her. When they returned to Los Angeles, he
tried to drive her to her residence on Kenmore Avenue. She

that he had not told the FBI on his prior interview. FAHEY
advised that at the time he was traveling through Santa Monica,
California, on June 4, 1968, on Pacific Coast Highway, he
was first followed by a 1966 Ford, dark blue in color, driven
by a single male, with California license plates numbers
unknown, FAHEY advised that this automobile followed them up
Pacific Coast Highway to approximately Malibu, at which time
it apparently disappeaszed behind him. He stated that the
1966 Ford episode occurred prior to his noticing the dark
blue Volkswagen which followed him from Malibu north. FAHEY
advised that the Ford, like the Volkswagen, would speed up
aad slow down, according to the driving habits of FAHEY.

The woman with FAHEY, described by him as GILDERDINE
OPPENHEIMER (phonetic), stated to FAHEY at the time the Ford
was following them, "They are following us". FAHEY asked,
"Who?" The woman replied, “They are going to get me if I
get you involved",

FAHEY advised that this woman stayed with him all
day, and after losing the Volkswagen on the Pacific Coast
Highway on the way to Oxnard, continued to advise him of the |
necessity of her obtaining a passport and passage to Australia.
FAHEY advised that nothing new was added to the conversation,
but rather she repeated many times what he has previously
reported she stated. ‘

FAHEY advised that he originally wanted to contact
two of his chemical ascounts in the tawn of Oxnard, California.
The accounts being Cal-Rob Rambler, Oxnard Boulevard, Oxnard,
California, and Don Monday Buick, Oxnard Boulevard, Oxnard,
California. No contact was made with these accounts since
FAHEY advised that he was afraid of what he had possibly
become involved in with the woman. FAHEY advised that he
continued through Oxnard without stopping and drove slowly
to Ventura, where he turned around, again without stopping,
and slowly retraced his steps south through Oxnard, stopping

He began work at approximately 8:00 a.m. on June 4,:
1968 and remained at the hotel through approximately 6:00 p.m.,

Shortly after midnight, on June 5, 1968, he was
located in the foyer on the Ambassador Room level just at the
bottom of the inside staircase which leads down from the level
where the Embassy Room is located.

He had two security guards with him at that location,
‘one of whom was WILLIE S. BELL, a guard from Ace Guard Service,
and the other one was LLOYD CURTIS, a guard employed by the
hotel.

They were at this location at the request of one of
Senator KENNEDY's aides, who had instructed them that the
Senator and his party were due to come down the enclosed
stairway and go to the Ambassador Room to talk to the people
located there. It was his understanding that the Senator was
to leave the Ambassador Room after a short speech and go out
the fire escape to his car and leave the hotel. At approximately
12:20 a.m., a female aide of Senator KENNEDY came to where he
was located and advised him that there had been a terrible
accident. She did not tell him anything about a shooting at
that time. .

He advised that he had not heard any gun shots at
the time. It was sometime later that he heard that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot. He estimated the time was probably
15 minutes after the actual shooting.
