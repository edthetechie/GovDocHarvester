CARLTON LAVERNE HAYES at 1406 South Cliveden Street,
Compton, California, was interviewed regarding his presence
at the Ambassador Hotel, 3300 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California, between the days of May 12-18 and on June 4-5, 1968.

HAYES advised on May 10, 1968, he was approached by
a classmate at Compton Junior College, JOHN AHRNDT, and requested
by AHRNDT to assist in distributing campaign literature for
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. AHRNDT asked that HAYES, and
anyone else HAYES could recruit, to meet him at the Ambassador
Hotel on Sunday, May 12, 1968, in order to receive consideration
concerning the distribution of this literature. HAYES stated
he and several friends went to the hotel on May 12, 1968, and were
supposed to hand out the KENNEDY literature on that same
afternoon. However, HAYES and his friends attended an impromptu
meeting of the Circle K, a service club at the junior college,
which prevented them from assisting AHRNDT, HAYES could only
recall that HAROLD NEWLIN (phonetic) accompanied him to the hotel
on May 12.

HAYES stated he did not return to the Ambassador
Hotel until June 4, 1958. At that time, he intended to apply
for a job at the Ambassador Hotel, however, after riding a
bus to the hotel from his home, he decided it would be too far
to travel to work. HAYES recalled he was at the hotel for
about an hour on June 4, and could only remember that it was
during the morning hours before lunch. Immediately after
leaving the hotel, he returned home by bus. HAYES advised
he first learned that Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY had been shot
when awakened by his mother during the early morning hours
of June 5, 1968.

HAYES viewed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
and stated he never saw anyone that resembled SIRHAN's photograph
in the Los Angeles newspapers on July 5, 1968. Further, that
nothing came to his attention while he was at the hotel that
Senator KENNEDY would be shot.’

HAYES stated that subsequent to the shooting of

He was in the Cordova Bar in Los Angeles the afternoon
of June 9, 1968, and he ran into JOHN WRIGHT at the bar. WRIGHT

June 9, 1968:

He had been working at the Ambassador Hotel in the
kitchen,as a kitchen reporter for two or three months up to the
time of’ the shooting of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. He saw SIRHAN
SIRHAN several times during the evening of June 4, 1968. SIRHAN
was in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel drinking coffee. A
pretty girl was waiting with SIRHAN that night, and SIRHAN kept
asking kitchen employees when Senator KENNEDY would be coming
through the kitchen.

As Senator KENNEDY came through the kitchen, he saw
one man try to hold Senator KENNEDY's arm to keep him still.
This was the man with dark glasses whose picture was in the paper.
He saw SIRHAN with a pistol but he did not see him pull the
trigger and he thinks somebody else did the actual shooting of
Senator KENNEDY.

following things during their discussion on June 9, 1968:

People in the Ambassador Hotel's kitchen had been
talking for two weeks about how they planned the

information:

She was a volunteer campaign worker for Senator

rode a bicycle from San Antonio, Texas, to Los Angeles,
arriving in Los Angeles on May 26, 1968. She was present
at Senator KENNEDY's victory celebration on the night of
June 4, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel. She heard about
four pops in quick succession shortly after Senator KENNEDY
left the Embassy Room; but she did not realize at the time
that they were shots. She, was at the Ambassador Hotel from
around 8:00 PM on June 4, 1968, until the time of the shooting,
but at no time did she see the man who has been identified
as SIRHAN SIRHAN.

On June 9, 1968, Mr. HOLDER, the Desk Clerk at

WRIGHT had said that he was a witness to the shooting and that
he knew something about it. She told HOLDER that she would
like to talk to WRIGHT; and HOLDER e¢alled WRIGHT at the Milner
Hotel and had him come to the Hope Hotel. Throughout the

He was employed as a “kitchen reporter" at the
Ambassador Hotel; and he was on duty from- 10:00 PM on
June 4, 1968, to 8:00 AM on June 5, 1968. He first noticed
the man identified in the newspaper as SIRHAN SIRHAN at about
11:00 PM on June 4, 1968, SIRHAN came into the kitchen at
that time, and he hung around in there drinking coffee. He
noticed SIRHAN because he was dressed differently from the
kitchen employees. He saw somebody shake KENNEDY's hand in
the kitchen. He saw SIRHAN facing KENNEDY and pointing the
gun at him; and he saw KENNEDY fall, but he was watching
STRHAN and he never saw SIRHAN pull the trigger of the gun.
WRIGHT observed this from the main kitchen by the refrigerator,
and he saw SIRHAN standing directly behind the steam table.

RONALD R. HUNTLEY was interviewed at 374 N.E.
Edison, Hilisboro, Oregon, where he was visiting. He
resides at 2902 East Burnside, Portland, Oregon, and is
employed as an interviewer at the Employment Center, Mead
Building, Portland, Oregon. He stated that during the
Primary campaign in Oregon, he was working as a volunteer
worker for Senator ROBERT KENNEDY and on the evening of
May 28, 1968, he was with Senator ROBERT KENNEDY at about
11:40 p.m. when Senator KENNEDY appeared at the ballroom
of the Benson Hotel, Portland, Oregon, and made a state-
ment to his supporters assembled there conceding the Primary .
election in the State of Oregon to Senator MC CARTHY.
HUNTLEY preceded Senator KENNEDY from the platform which
they stepped off from the left side and to the rear, going
a short distance to a kitchen door with the intention that
Senator KENNEDY go through the kitchen and come up to the
elevator on the back side and avoid the crowd. As he
stepped off the platform which was about two feet high,
he saw two men standing in front of the kitchen door and
as the party proceeded towards the door, the two men
stepped back into the kitchen. He had the impression that
one of them spoke to the other and assumed they were together.
One man was heavy ‘set and the other had a medium-slender
build. As HUNTLEY came into the kitchen, he put his hands
against the back of the heavy set man and pushed him against
the wall so that Senator KENNEDY and the party could go ;
on through. He assumes that the slender man stepped out of
the way as he did not see him again. As he pushed the
heavy set man against the wall, he felt something under his
coat which could be a weapon or a thick, wide belt. He
told the man to stand still while the party passed through.
He then turned away from the heavy set man to offer aid to
Representative EDITH GREENE who was also in the party, and
to keep her from being pushed by the crowd.

Mr. HUNTLEY stated that he thought he should
inform the FBI of thig incident inasmuch as the news broad-
east in the early morning of June 5, 1968, described the

LCRENA KURTZ, 4110 Monroe Street, was interviewed
at her resicence.

KURTZ stated she called FBI Headquarters, Washington,
D. C., on June 7, 1968. At the time of her call to Washington
she added she was very distressed over the death of Senator
KENNEDY. She continued she is presently under a doctor's care
for treatment of nervous spasms. She added she has no infor-
mation to furnish that her next door neighbor is a friend of
an individual who conspired with SIRHAN SIRHAN. KURTZ said this
is a false statement. KURTZ agreed that she made such a
statement, however, she repeated she was very upset when she
made this statement.

KURTZ continued that until June 9, 1968, she had
neighbors residing at 4108 Monroe Street, who were of Arabic
nationality. This family consisted of a man and wife and two
children; a girl age 10 and a boy age eight years. She does not
know the name of this family. She was exhibited a photograph
of SIRHAN and advised she has never observed SIRHAN at the
residence at 4108 Monroe Street and she has no reason to
believe that this family is acquainted with SIRHAN or is

. Mr. GEORGE B. MARWICK, Vagabond Trailer Village, 2400 El.
Camino Real, Space 10, Mountain View, California, advised as
follows:

He is acquainted with LEONARD L. EDWARDS, who lives in
Space 40 at the above address. EDWARDS resides there with
his wife, VIOLA FAY, and they have been there about a year and
a half. EDWARDS is semi-retired and a painter by trade. His
wife sells real estate.

On Saturday, June 8, 1968, the day of ROBERT KENNEDY's
funeral, he (MARWICK) watched the funeral on television and was
‘particularly moved by the eulogy given by Senator KENNEDY at
the funeral service. Some time during the morning he saw
EDWARDS in the street outside the trailers and they began talk-
ing about politics. The shooting of ROBERT KENNEDY came up.

At that time EDWARDS made some strange remarks which he (MARWICK)
thought should be reported. MARWICK mentioned that it was too
bad that BOBBY KENNEDY had been.shot, and that he had just seen
EDWARD KENNEDY on television, and that EDWARD KENNEDY probably
now would run for the Presidency. EDWARDS then said, “When we
don't like them in California, we kill thei," and then mention-
ing Senator EDWARD KENNEDY, said, “We'll kill that son of a
bitch, too, if he runs.”

EDWARDS also mentioned that he had been in the Watts Area
at the time of the riots, and that they all had guns ready to go
in case the Negroes came into their area, but the police told
then to hold off.

At various times during the past several months he has seen
EDWARDS walking around: the streets:of the trailer court with
handguns in his hip pockets. One of the guns is a German luger
while the other is a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson. EDWARDS did
not have any guns with him on the morning of June 8 when they
were talking about the KENNEDYs. He has not seen the guns
recently.

He knows of no criminal activities of EDWARDS or that he

FRANK C, ATLES, who is the Chief of Police of
the Delano, California, Police Department, furnished the

following information and requested that the’ source of

information Chimself) be kept confidential:

About five we eks ago, early May, a short time
after the shooting of MARTIN LUTHER KING, he and several
friends were drinking in “the Blk's Club in Delanc. He

recalls that one of the individuals with him was Lieutenant

COMBS of his own Department. The other individuals he does

mot recall other than a ROY MURRAY who Lives in Harlimart,
California.

On this occasion, MURRAY advised the group that he
had received a long distance telephone call from friends in

_the Las Vegas area requesting a contribution from him to help

pay a one half to ones quarter million dellar contract to
assassinate ROBERT | DY, HURRAY stated that the assassir
was to take place if Pit appeared RENNEOY was to gain the Denc-
cratic Presidential nomination, and that California was con-
sidered as the couslusive pro oof point of that probable nomination.

MURRAY bragged that he had offered "$200 towards this
contract, He intimated that these fri lends” were members of the
"Mafia, He further stated that he told the people from Las
Vegas that he could probably drum up at least $50,000 to

$100,000 in Delano, California, area elone.

fs

ATLES further advised that KENNEDY has been to Delano
three times in the past year, Prior to KENNE

iADY's visits the

area was quiet and untroubled, howevez, since his visits there

have been riots, strikes, and picketing.

The wealthy farmers in the area all hate KENNEDY,
When KENNEDY came to visit CHAVEZ on his hunger strike he
refused to allow any local police to furnish him any pro-
tection. When he arrived on these visits he came by _
private plane which would land at the airport at Memorial
Park in Delano. On his last visit very few people met or
saw KENNEDY off.

AILES stated he felt that MURRAY was probably
just blowing his own horn because of the high feeling. |
against KENNEDY in the area. MURRAY is a reasonably
wealthy farmer in the areaand does make frequent trips
to Las Vegas. At the time the above comments were made
the general tenor of conversation had been for the KING
assassination and against the JOHN F. KENNEDY assassination.
Someone in the group had mentioned that they had shot the
wrong KENNEDY and it was too bad it had net been ROBERT in-
stead of JOHN that had been killed, ATLES feels that this
probably triggered MURRAY's comments.

MURRAY is a “known gambler in the area but has no
police record for such activities. He frequently loses
several thousands of dollars at a time when he visits

Las Vegas, but this does not appear to bother him, AILES
feels that if MURRAY is confronted with this situation
he probably will either admit making the comments or
elaim that he does not remember making the comments. He
feels MURRAY is not the type of individual to. back down
and that if he did make this statement in jest he probably
would admit it if questioned by authorities.

AILES had forgotten the incident and it was only
brought to his mind by Lieutenant COMBS after KENNEDY was |
assassinated immediately after winning the California .
election.

Miss PAM MIKI, Secretary, "The Joe Pyne Show,”
Television Station KTTV - Channel 11, Los Angeles, California,
advised as follows:

For several days following the assassination of
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, "The Joe Pyne Show” was deluged
with calls in which the callers indicated they recognized
news media photographs of SIRHAN B. SIRHAN as being identical
with an individual who had appeared on a Joe Pyne Show when it
featured a guest, who recently returned from the Middle East
and who discussed the Arab-Israeli war. It was indicated that
STRHAN had been in the studio audience and had come up to the
"beef box" to express a viewpoint supporting the Arab position in
the war.

Miss MIKI pointed out that normally individuals who
appear in the "beef box" are requested to sign waivers. A
search had been conducted, and no waiver under the name of
STRHAN had been located.

Miss MIKI advised that a canvass of employees of the
JOR PYNE staff indicated SIRHAN might have appeared on a show
which was taped on June 19, 1967, and which was aired in the
Los Angeles area on June 24, 1967. Or he possibly could have
appeared on a show taped June 12, 1967, which was aired on
June 17, 1967. Both shows dealt with the Arab-Israeli situation.

. Miss MIKI said it had been ascertained that the video
and audio tapes of both of the above shows had been erased. She
indicated that the staff's recollection was that an individual
probably identical with SIRHAN had appeared in the "beef box"
in one of the above-described shows and had strongly supported
the Arab point of view in the Arab-Israeli war.

Mr. RON REYNOLDS, Program Director, KNEW Radio Broadcasting
Station, 66 Jack London Square, Oakland, California, on June 18,
1968, advised as follows: :

All individuals who call in on the talk programs are anonymous.
The callers are screened by the program producer before they are
referred to the announcer.

Concerning the appearance on the Hilly Rose Show at 10:30 A.M..
Memorial Day, May 30, 1968, of GEORGE PLIMPTON of New York, REY-
NOLDS reviewed a tape of the program and talked to the producer.

He was told by the producer that the voice of an individual who
called in concerning Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was not that of a
regular or repeater. REYNOLDS estimated the voice to be that of
a male in his 50s or 60s.

In listening to a tape of the show, REYNOLDS said that the
caller appeared to him to be a supporter of ROBERT F. KENNEDY.
The caller asked if consideration had been given by ROBERT KENNEDY
to the possibility that he could be killed as had happened to his
brother, JOHN F. KENNEDY. The reply to the caller was that anyone
in the public light must expect that such things are a possibility.

Mr. REYNOLDS advised that he would make a copy of the pertin-
ent part of the above program and make it available on the morning
of June 19, 1968.

On June 19, 1968, Mr. REYNOLDS made available a tape of the
described program.
