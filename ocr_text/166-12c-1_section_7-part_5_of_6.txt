_ Information was received from the Oklahoma City
Office that on April 4, 1969, DON WISE was re-interviewed,
at Bristow, Oklahoma:

WISE stated that he was positive that he picked up
the individual he believed to be SIRHAN SIRHAN at about 1:00
p.m. on’Saturday, June 1, 1968. Mr. WISE was shown the chart
setting forth the activities of SIRHAN B, SIRHAN which indi-
cates that he was in Los Angeles, California, at 1:00 p.m.
on June 1, 1968. Mr. WISE stated that he iS positive of the
date and noted that it would be impossible for the person
to be both places. . Mr. WISE commented at this point that he
had never seen a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN.

. WISE was re-interviewed on April 8, “1969, at which |
time he was shown.a photograph of SIRHAN B..SIRHAN. Mr. WISE
stated that while the photograph looked somewhat. like the
individual he picked up could not have been SIRHAN SIRHAN.

Mr. WISE pointed out that the person he picked up was definitely
over 5'63" in height, and noted that SIRHAN SIRHAN is only

513", Mr. WISE further noted that in view of the difference

in height and the fact that SIRHAN was definitely placed in

Los Angeles on the day he picked up the individual, he felt

he must have been mistaken as-to the identity of the hitchhiker.

On April 8, 1969, the photograph of SIRHAN B,. STRHAN
was shown to Mrs. DON WISE at which time she advised this
" individual looked somewhat like the person she and her husband
had picked up but noted that she could not say whether or not
they were identical. Mrs. WISE noted that the person that
they picked up definitely was taller than 5'6". Mrs. WISE.
statedshe feels that she and her husband were mistaken as
to the identity of the individual that they picked up and noted
they were both extremely shocked at the death of ROBERT KENNEDY
and may have let their imaginations get the better of their.
judg\ment.

“ee REF

Transmitted herewith is the text of a leaflet, which 1
the Embassy received through the mail, concerning

the trial of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. It was signed

by the "Palestine Women's Association".

The thesis of the tract is that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan's
action should be looked upon as a political action
directly linked to the struggle of the displaced
Palestinian people to regain their homeland. The
writer hopes Sirhan's action will not prejudice the
reaching of an understanding between the American

and Palestinian peoples.

Dear Senator Cranston:

This is in reply to your aesorandua of April 17,
1969, enclosing a letter from Mr. Jim Peacock
cencerning the proper venue for trials of individuals
charged with killing federal officials. Please excuse
wy delay in responding. .

. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution seaures
the right ef a person being tried in a federal eourt
to be tried in the district in which the alleged
offense waa committed. Thus, where the Uni States
has the authority to try the alleged killera of
federal offfelals, the trial could not be eonduated
in Washington, D. C. unless the offense was ceanitted
re.

I am returning your enelasure herewith.
