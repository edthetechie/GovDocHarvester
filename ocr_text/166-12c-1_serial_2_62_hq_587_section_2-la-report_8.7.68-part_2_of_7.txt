LAWRENCE PATRICK OSBORN was interviewed at Fox
Drugs, 6005 Rosemead Boulevard, Pico Rivera, and advised he
resides at 6060 Noroco, Pico Rivera, California,

OSBORN advised that on the evening of June 4, 1968,
he went ,with an acquaintance, MICHAEL ROUNSEVILLE, to the
victory celebration of Senator KENNEDY, being held at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. He stated they
arrived at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 8:00 p.m.
and unsuccessfully attempted to enter the room where Senator
KENNEDY was to make an appearance and give a victory speech.
He stated they were turned away from this room and directed
to another room in the same hotel, where the precinct workers
and other supporters of the Senator KENNEDY nomination were
also holding a victory party. OSBORN stated he remained with
ROUNSEVILLE in this second room for the remainder of the
evediing except for a period of about twenty minutes from
11:00 p.m, to 11:20 p.m. when he escorted two girls to
a parking lot on the hotel grounds. He stated that during
the evening and during the victory speech made by Senator
KENNEDY, he and ROUNSEVILLE remained in the room watching
the speech on television monitors, which had been set up in the
room. -

OSBORN stated that the first indication he received
that something had occurred was during the early hours of
June 5, 1968 when someone began to tell the crowd in the
room ,in which jhe was located sto "shut up". He stated that
eventually the crowd in that room became quiet and then a
rumor passed through the room that someone had been shot,
Shortly thereafter a rumor went through the crowd that a woman
had been shot; and shortly thereafter a rumor that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot in the hip. OSBORN stated he never
ascertained the extent of injuries of Senator KENNEDY until after
he left the hotel at 2:30 a.m. It was then while enroute home
he heard on the radio that Senator KENNEDY had been shot in the

head,

OSBORN said, however, that he had never been in the
presence of Senator KENNEDY that evening or the following :
morning and only became aware of the assassination of the Senator
when the word spread through the hotel that the Senator had been
shot. OSBORN said he did not see the Senator and
did not see the assassination, He has no knowledge whatsoever
of the alleged assassin or circumstances surrounding the
assassination except those he has learned from the press and
television.

OSBORN stated that after the shooting a Mexican~
American girl, age about 24, heavy set, was observed by him
in the room making a statement to the effect that when she
had been outside some men and a women had run by her and
shouted "We just shot KENNEDY.', or words to that effect.
OSBORN stated the girl was in an extremely emotional state and
he put little faith in what she said. He stated that as an
example a rumor was heard that a bodyguard had been assigned
to Senator MC CARTHY and when some of the people there expressed
frustration that this protection had not been assigned to
Senator KENNEDY, this girl began to scream to them, making
accusatory statements that they were in effect the cause of the
assassination. OSBORN stated that for this reason he would
put very little faith in what this girl said. He added that
he understands that she subsequently was interviewed on
television and gave information regarding a girl or a woman
in a polkadot dress. OSBORN expressed the opinion that any-
thing this girl said should be closely scrutinized,

OSBORN advised that the photograph of him and
ROUNSEVILLE, which appeared in the latest edition of Life
magazine, along with others depicting the apparent state of
shock, was not taken anyplace in the immediate vicinity of
the assassination, but in another room entirely removed from
the assassination site.

OSBORN advised that he could furnished no further
information concerning this matter,

JENNIE RANELLE (Mrs, ROCCO RANELLE) was interviewed
at her residence 1110/1 Tiara in North Hollywood, California,
at which time she advised as follows:

On Election Day, June 4, 1968, Mrs. RANELLE was at
the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. She was
there at the Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY campaign activities as
a guest of BOB FUNK, a CBS television soundman. At approxi-
matdy 9:45 to 10:00 p.m., Mrs. RANELLE was in the press room
of the Ambassador Hotel, which room is located off the kitchen
and behind the Embassy Room. She was waiting the return of
Mr. FUNK, who was then apparently with Senator KENNEDY in
Senator KENNEDY's suite of the hotel. This was shortly before
Senator KENNEDY made his wetory speech in the Embassy Room.

While Mrs. RANELLE was in this press room she was
standing near the door from the room leading into the kitchen.
She noticed a young white male enter the press room from the
door that leads to the corridor. This door is across the room
from the kitchen door. This young man spoke to several individuals
ali of whom are unknown to Mrs. RANELLE in the press room.

He then came directly to Mrs. RANELLE. He noticed that she had
two press badges on her apparel. At this time this young man
said, “I'm working with the KENNEDY campaign but I didn't get

a badge, can you let me have one of yours". Mrs. RANELLE
denied this request and told the man in her opinion if he was
working with the KENNEDY campaign he would have a badge of his
own. The man then replied, "Please let me have one, you have
two and you don't need both of them, let me have one of yours".
Mrs. RANELLE again denied the request and the man left her.

She further stated she saw him approaching a few other persons
in the press room and then she did not see him again at any time.

Mrs. RANELLE observed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN in the press and on television following the assassination
of Senator KENNEDY. She recognized this photograph as strongly
resembling the young man who had approached her for a press
badge.

, parted

Characteristics Carried some object in his hand,

She stated that this individual looked exactly like
the photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN except that he de-
finitely was not wearing a zippered jacket as appears in the
Los Angeles Police Department photographs of the individual
after his arrest. He was wearing a suit or sports coat,
winter knit, predominately black with red and gray flecks
throughout.

At the time of Senator KENNEDY's speech, Mre. RANELLE
was standing on a platform in back of the speaker's podium.
Following the speech she was in the crowd leaving the speaker's
platform as it surged towards, and through, the kitchen area.

She was at the door leading from the Embassy Room to the kitchen
when she heard three explosions in quick succession followed

by two more quick explosions. She saw flashes in the vicinity
of where Senator KENNEDY was at the time. She did not see a

gun nor did she see any person resembling SIRHAN SIRHAN or the
person she had seen earlier as described above. At this point
the crowd in the kitchen reversed itself and began to leave the
kitchen very quickly. This movement forced Mrs, RANELLE against
the wall just outside the kitchen and at the door leading to

- 360 -

the kitchen. From this vantage point, Mrs. RANELLE observed

a woman leaving the kitchen with blood streaming from a fore-

head wound. She aided this woman until a uniformed security

guard appeared. She turned this woman over to the guard and that is
the last she saw of either of them. This woman was a white

female with blond hair and she was wearing only one shoe. She

was wearing a flowered yellow dress with black flowers.

MICHAEL RHODES, 4342 Nogales Drive, Tarzana, telephone
number 987-2736, advised that he was a volunteer worker -for Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY. He was interviewed at his residence in the
presence of Officer MORGAN, Los Angeles Police Department. He
furnished the following information with respect to his knowledge
of the events of June 4 and June 5, 1968, at the Ambalssador
Hotel where Senator KENNEDY was shot:

He arrived at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately
8:30 p.m. on June 4, 1968, with his wife NINA RHODES.| They
went to the press area of the Embassy Room and spent the evening
there following the primary election returns. When the Senator
made his victory speech, he heard this speech from the press
room area.

Following the speech, he recalls that the Senator
exited the platform to his rear through some curtains| leading
into the kitchen passageway. His wife NINA followed the
‘Senator in the hopes of personally congratulating him! on his
victory. He was approximately ten feet behind his wife and had
a view of the kitchen passageway, when he suddenty heard a
popping sound which he thought sounded like a string of Lighted
firecrackers going off. His wife then turned and statted to
run toward him at full speed, so he thought that the Senator
had changed directions,as this was the type of crowd reaction
that often times occurred with the Senator. He was at the
doorway leading to the rear of the podium when he grabbed his
wife and yanked her into the doorway. She was screaming,

"He's killed" and he immediately told her to "stop that kind
of talking" since.she had no idea whether it was truejor not.

When the firecracker sounds had gone off and he
observed Bis wife running toward him and various screams and
shouts he suddenly realized that shots had been fired His
reaction was that the shots must have come from an automatic
weapon since they were so rapid.

when he went to the lobby to get some drinks he informed the

NINA R. RHODES, 4342 Nogales Drive, Tarzana, telephone
number 987-2736, advised that she was a volunteer fund raiser
for Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY and she furnished the following
information with respect to the events at the Ambassador Hotel
on June 4 and June 5, 1968. She was interviewed at’ her
residence in the presence of Officer MORGAN, Los Angeles Police
Department:

At approximately 8:30 p.m. on June !t, 1968, she
went to the Ambassador Hotel with her husband MICHAEL RHODES
and reported to the press staff area located west of the stage
in the Embassy Room. She wore an off-white, short, Russian
cossack type dress and during the course of the evening, she
followed the election results with PIERRE SALINGER, : FRANK
MANKIEWICZ and various other KENNEDY staff members.

When the Senator made his speech at approximately
midnight, she heard it from the press room area. She estimates
that everyone knew that the Senator was going through the kitchen
area approximately 15 minutes before his speech ended,
since a tall bond man, name unknown, came over to the press
area and asked PIERRE SALINGER which way he wanted the Senator
to leave the stage. SALINGER indicated that he wanted the
Senator to turn to his right, proceed through the staff press
area, then through the kitchen area to the Colonial Room, the
site of the main KENNEDY press room in the Ambassador Hotel.
She thinks that SALINGER chose this route because he wanted
to congratulate the Senator personally on his victory and
have other key members of his staff also congratulate him.

She recalls that previously when she had heard of the Senator's
victory, she had asked Mr. SALINGER if she could personally
congratulate the Senator when he finished his speech and

Mr. SALINGER stated that she could. The Senator did not take
the indicated route, however, but exited the podium back
through the curtains to the rear of the stage which led to the
kitchen passageway. When this happened, Mr. SALINGER said

"Go, baby" indicating that she should follow the Senator

quickly through the kitchen passageway.

She grabbed LUCY SALINGER's hand, who she stated
was a KENNEDY volunteer and a Los Angeles resident, and
together they ran into the kitchen passageway. She stated
this area slanted downward in the direction they were running
and that it was cluttered with all sorts of cables. She
tried to focus her attention on the Senator's head, thereby
making it easier for her to determine his whereabouts. She
had just left the entrance to the kitchen and noticed the
Senator shaking hands with various kitchen employees and
continue proceeding down the hallway when she suddenly heard
a sound like a firecracker and she saw a red-like flash
three to four feet from the left of the Senator's head.

She estimates that she was approximately ten feet from the
Senator when she observed this. She instantaneously realized
that she was there and that shots were being fired. She
later recalled hearing eight distinct shots. Everything
appeared to her like still frames in a stop-action movie.

She recalls seeing the Senator's head and suddenly everyone
dropping to the floor. After the first shot the remaining
ones sounded like a lighted string of firecrackers. They
appeared to be very high in the air for, when she saw the
flashes, she had to look up and the flashes appeared higher
than the heads of the group of people in front of her.

‘From her position, which was behind and slightly to the left
rear of the Senator, the flashes were slightly to the left
front of the Senator. When the shots were fired, she also
noticed a cameraman violently throw himself against.the wall.
She also heard people screaming, and she recalls the words,
"Get out of the way. Let's get out of here”.

The individual who fired the shots at the Senator
appeared to her to be wearing a powder blue jacket and he
seemed to be framed against the walls which were also powder
‘blue. When she saw him, he seemed to be turned from her so
that she saw part of his back and left side as he was in what
she described,as a semi-crouch position. She originally
recalls that she told the Los Angeles Police Department that

found out that SITRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was wearing a powder blue
Jacket. She stated she could not identify the individual who
fired the shots because she did not see his face, but she
thinks that she could identify the jacket he was wearing.

What she does Know, however, was that this individual was
not a Negro.

Following the shooting, she does not exactly recall
what happened in the kitchen area. She vaguely remembers
that she was on the floor and that people were stepping on
her. Her husband told her that she left the area on a dead
run and shouted, "He's killed" as she proceeded back toward
the Embassy press ares. It was as she was leaving the kitchen
passageway when her husband grabbed her and told her not to
make those kind of statements. She recalls that she lost her
purse in the kitchen area and before leaving, she heard someone
say, "Get towels and ice".

She later heard people shouting from the kitchen
area, "They got 'em", several times from several individuals.

She described the general area being filled with
hostility, women shouting and screaming, and general confusion.

She advised that she considers that security in the
area was very 1%x in that the guard in the kitchen portion of
the Embassy Room seemed to allow any unauthorized individuals
through that area. In this regard, many individuals who were
authorized to enter the erea were denied access.

NELSON RISING was interviewed at his place of
employment, 433 South Spring Street, at which time he furnished
the following information:

He was a volunteer for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY,
and on June 4, 1968, he and his wife, SHARON, went to the
Ambassador Hotel to await the results of the California
primary. He arrived at the hotel at approximately 7:30 pm,
and went immediately to the Embassy Room of the hotel. On
several occasions he left the Embassy Room to get drinks
and cigarettes, but was in the room when Senator KENNEDY
gave his victory speech.

At the time of the victory speech he was approximately
30 feet away from Senator KENNEDY and as KENNEDY left the
podium after the speech, RISING and his wife, SHARON, began
to move towards the door of the Embassy Room in an effort to
leave the hotel. As they were moving, at the rear of the
crowd he heard shouting and screaming from the area of the
door leading to the kitchen. At first he thought Senator
KENNEDY had decided to leave the Embassy Room through the
crowd, but later people began saying that there had been a
shooting and someone began asking for a doctor. About this
time, STEVE SMITH asked the people to leave the Embassy Room.
RISING and his wife then went into the lobby of the Ambassador
Hotel. While in the lobb: rumors again spread that KENNEDY
had not been shot, but one of the aides had been shot. Still
later a man wearing a sweater came out of the Embassy Room
and said that KENNEDY had been shot. The sweater the man .
was wearing had blood on it and RISING stated that he was the
man in the newspaper photograph shown fanning KENNEDY. When
this man came into the lobby and stated that KENNEDY had
been shot, another individual, unknown to RISING, became
excited and started to fight with him. After breaking up
this fight, RISING next recalls seeing the police taking
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN from the Ambassador Hotel. This was
the first time RISING can recall ever seeing SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN,

While awaiting in the lobby to see what was
happening, RISING recalls talking to someone who stated that
they had seen SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN earlier in the evening
trying to get into the “smbassy Room by claiming that he was
with the press. This person was also supposed to have
seen SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN trying to get into a better posi-
tion near the stage when Senator KENNEDY was giving his
victory speech. RISING is not certain who this person was,
but he believes it was either JERRY DODDERMAN, or a friend of
DODDERMAN's. RISING was not sure of the spelling of
DODDERMAN and thought that perhaps it could have been
DODDERSON. In any case, DODDERMAN handled the sound equip-
ment for KENNEDY, was formerly employed by a newspaper in
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and should be able to be contacted through
TED KENNEDY's Office in Washington D. C. RISING further
described this man as being a white male, approximately 23
years old, blond curly hair, six feet tall.

At about 2:00 am, RISING and his wife, SHARON,
left the Ambassador Hotel and went to the home of BOB
THOMPSON, later returning, at about 4:00 am, to the Ambassador
Hotel, where he picked up his car and returned to his own home,

. RISSER said the members of the NBC crew had expecjfed
Senator KENNEDY to léave the room by the main entrance to
the room which would have been to Senator KENNEDY's left
from the position in which he had just spoken. The rea~
son for his last minute change of plans was not known.

It was presumed by the NBC crew that KENNEDY had changed
‘his route in order to save time in leaving the room.

RISSER said the room was very crowded and it would have
taken Senator KENNEDY considerably longer to leave the reom
by the main entrance. RISSER said he saw a group of people
‘ooking into a kitchen hallway and suddenly people began
screaming and crying. RISSER's first impression was
Senator KENNEDY had collapsed from physical exhaustion due
to the intensive schedule he maintained throughout the
Oregon and California primaries. RISSER said he did not
know who made the decision which changed KENNEDY's route

-on leaving the Embassy Room. He said he presumed this: was
a last minute decision on the part of someone since it

had been expected Senator KENNEDY would exit through the
main entrance, although nothing definite had ever been
said on the actual route he was to leave the room.

RISSER said he did not observe SIRHAN SIRHAN prior to
the time Senator KENNEDY was shot and he did not observe.
SIRHAN any time after the shooting.

On the evening of June 4, 1958, he went to Dodger

the Ambassador Hotel they parked their car in thé rear parking
lot directly south of the Ambassador Hotel facing south.
They decided not to enter the notel since the speech was still
going on and there was a very large crowd in the vicinity
and they thought that the ballroom would be very crowded.
Immeciately following the speech they heard aftot of confusion
on the radio, and then they heard someone try to clear the
room. Then, STEEN SMITH came on the air and started telling
everyone to please clear the room. They thought at that time
that he was Senator KWNNEDY because of nis accent. Then
another individual, who they later learned was a priest, came
on the air and stated, "we need medical attention for tne
Senator. Please clear the room".

At that time two individuals came walking quickly
by their car heading south. One, a male caucasian of Mexican
extraction was asked by JIM what had nappened, and this
individual stated that he worked at the hotel as a waiter;
that he had just ghaken hands with Senator KENNEDY; and, that
someone had just shot Senator KENNEDY and that he was dead.
As this individual was stating that Senator KENNEDY had just
been shot, he demonstrated this by simulating a gun with his
rignt hand and pointed it to his head. He also stated that
he had ducked to the floor to get out of the way of the bullets.

MICHAEL ROUNSEVILLE, age 19, residing 9660 Bascom,
Pico Rivera, California advised on the evening of June 4, 1968,
he and an acquaintance, PAT OSBORN, went from Pico Rivera to
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, to attend the victory
celebration of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, who apparently had
won the delegates from the State of California to the
Democratic National Convention to be held in the Summer of
1968, He stated they arrived at the Ambassador Hotel about
8:00 p.m. and attempted to enter the room where Senator
KENNEDY was to give his victory speech. They were prohibited
from entering the room and advised the room was only for members
of the press or people who had held executive positions in the
KENNEDY campaign. ROUNSEVILLE stated thereafter he and OSBORN
were directed to another room in the hotel where precinct workers
of the campaign were holding a victory celebration. He stated
he remained in this room for the remainder of the evening
and he stated he watched on television monitors the victory
statement given by Senator KENNEDY in another room of the
hotel.

He stated, however, that he had never been in the
presence of Senator KENNEDY that evening or the following
morning and only became aware of the assassination of the Senator
when the word spread through the hotel that the Senator had been
shot. ROUNSEVILLE said he did not see the senator and
did not see the assassination. He has no knowledge whatsoever
of the alleged assassin or circumstances surrounding the
assassination except those he has learned from the press and
television.

ROUNSEVILLE stated the only information he could
give which would have any bearing whatsoever on the investigation
regarding the assassination of Senator KENNEDY is that he
did see a young girl in the room where he was at the Ambassador
Hotel, who in an apparent emotional outburst made some
muddled comments regarding the assassination, He stated

this girl, name unknown, later was interviewed by one or more

concerning the presence at the assassination scene of another

and examine closely any statements made by this girl who
furnished information concerning the girl in the polkadot
adress, because it is his considered opinion that this girl

in such a highly emotional state, could have said anything,
none of which might have had any basis in reality.

OSBORN, which appeared in the latest edition of Life magazine
along with others depicting the apparent state of shock was
not taken anyplace in the immediate vicinity of the assassination,
but in another room entirely removed from the assassination

worketype clothes, possibly jeans, and his facial characteristics
conformed with those of the waiters. RUBIN advised he did
not pay any attention to this person and therefore would not
be able to identify him.

speech, he turned to his right and walked from the podium
toward the kitchen. RUBIN etated his wife, BARBARA, who wags

telephone 883-2133, related the following:

She and her husband had gone to the Embassy Room at
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, shortly after
midnight on June 5, 1968. The purpose was to join the campaign
party of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. They were unable to get
into the Embassy Room through the main entrance, as it was full.
Toney found that by going through a kitchen area, off this room,
they could enter the Embassy Room without being challenged.
There were only three people in the kitchen when she and her
husband entered. They were all dark complected men, two of
whom appeared to be kitchen workers as they were moving about.
One was tall and the other short. The third man, slight of
puild, was just standing against the wall in about the middle
of the kitchen. She did not note details of his dress but did
note this third man did not appear to be a kitchen worker.

Mrs. RUBIN and her husband went on into the Embassy
Room just as Senator ROBERT KENNEDY was finishing his speech.
They had arrived at a point a few feet from the podium where
Senator KENNEDY was standing when he made some remark about
Mayor SAM YORTY of Los Angeles, which ended his speech. Senator
KENNEDY then started for the kitchen. Mr. and Mrs. RUBIN
followed him. They were separated by the pressure of the crowd
near the kitchen door and Mrs. RUBIN followed the KENNEDY party

Mr. PAUL SCHRADE was right behind Senator KENNEDY and
Mrs, RUBIN was behind Mr. SCHRADE when she suddenly heard three
shots followed by five quick shots. She realized someone was
shooting in her direction but she could not see who it was, as
Mr. SCHRADE was taller than she.. She, at this point, "hit the

got up she ran out of the kitchen to join her husband, She
hid behind things until she found her way out as she did not
know whether or not there might be more shooting.

The Los Angeles Police Department had questioned
Mrs. RUBIN briefly after the shooting, asking her if she had
seen the shooting. She replied "no" and was not questioned
further.

Mrs. RUBIN had appeared on television but was not
interviewed. She was standing near the door of the Embassy
Room when the television news cameras picked up an interview
being conducted of a Negro doctor who -had been at the scene.
There had been some comment in news programs and in the press
of a couple being sought for interview, exact source not
recalled. She was of the opinion the descriptions furnished of
the couple being sought and apparently seen in the kitchen area
pefore the shooting generally fit that of her and her husband.

Mrs. RUBIN described herself as a white female, 33
years of age, 5' 5", wearing two-inch heels, olive complexion,
135 - 140 pounds, dark shoulder length hair worn bouffant style,
dark eyes. She was wearing a white dress with red belt sash
and a bright red and white checkered jacket. Sne, at times,
carried the jacket.

She described Mr, RUBIN as a white male, 6', 185
pounds, 35 years of age, broad shoulders. He was wearing a
navy blue blazer and gray slacks.

Mrs. RUBIN furnished a photograph of herself taken in
March 1968, which she said could be used for further identificatio
if desired. The photograph need not be returned.

Following examination of photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN

and his brothers, Mrs. RUBIN was of the opinion that the photograpi
of SIRHAN SIRHAN resembled the person she had seen in the kitchen

the shooting of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY at the Ambassador
Hotel on June 5, 1968:

He arrived at the ball room of the Ambassador Hotel
at approximately 8:00 p.m. on June 4, 1968, and waited there
until Senator KENNEDY started his speech. He recalled standing
between the television platforms located on the west and south
walls of the Embassy Room. Shortly after the Senator's speech,
at approximately midnight, he thought he heard balloons popping,
and he assumed that the balloons he heard were those that were
used as decorations over the platform area from which the Senator
spoke. Just after this, however, he heard someone say that the
Senator was shot and he noticed that this reaction spread across
the room. At that time he realized that the sounds he had
thought were balloons popping must have been shots.

Shortly thereafter he observed a middle aged lady
being escorted from the kitchen area with blood streaming down
her face. Following this, he and his wife attempted to clear
the ball room in support of instructions from the Los Angeles
Police Department. After the ball room was cleared, he and
his wife, KAY, left the Ambassador Hotel and returned to their
home where they watched the remaining events on television.

Mrs. KATHERINE A, TURRELL, residence, 20912
Spindrift Lane, Huntington Beach, was contacted at her
father's residence, 2127 Aralia Street. She advised that
she and her family attended the Senator KENNEDY victory
celebration at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4-5, 1968.
She stated that she was standing about ten feet to the
right of Senator KENNEDY as he spoke recognizing his
victory on June 4, 1968, in the California primary and
that many KENNEBY supporters had lined up, arm in arm, on
Senator KENNEDY's right, providing a corridor through which
he was expected to travel.

She stated it was her understanding Senator KENNEDY
would exit to his right, through this human corridor to
leave through a door behind and to the right of her, which
_she could not see, She stated there were many good sized
men in this human corridor, and approximately at midnight
on June 4, 1963, she looked over this group into the
Embassy Room. On the other side of the human corridor
she observed an individual standing above the corridor.

She surmised he must have been standing on a box of some
kind. She stated this individual joined his hands together
and gestured to someone behind her and to her right who

she did not see, as if he was going to dive over the human
corridor. She stated that with his lips he said, "I am
going to get him." She stated she barely heard him utter
these words, could not recall what his voice sounded like
but there is no doubt in her mind that he uttered these
words. She stated she cannot be sure what he meant, but
since there were several hundred people in the Embassy Room,
the noise made his voice just barely audible. She estimated
she stood about 20 feet from this individual and described
him as follows:
