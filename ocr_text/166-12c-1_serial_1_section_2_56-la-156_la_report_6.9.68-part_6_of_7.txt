Senator DEAN RUSK resembles the (unintelligible)

No.
He has a great resemblance to you.
Only I got a little bit more hair than he has.

A little lighter. Really a little make-up, boy
and you're an actor in Hollywood.

Of course I never seen him, only on television.
Same difference.

All people look a little different when you see them
in person.

What's taking Mr. JORDON so long?

I don't Know. When you get into one of these things
it gets a little involved, sometimes mysterious.
Investigation becomes tedious.

Well eh interesting. In all it's possibilities.

The interesting part of it. One of the interesting
things is to find out exactly who JOHN DOE is.
That's what I'm interested in.

You know that's beautiful, beautiful. Maybe we
should keep it interesting.

SIRHAN: Well I think, like I said, I'm always opened for any
kind of an intellectual educational, anything that

would benefit my mind as well as whatever I can
contribute to there helpfulness or benefit of that

proposition, What more can you ask for.

OFFICER: Well, first you could have a nice conversation and

it doesn't take too long. You know. There's people

Fourth or June 1968, because there might have been
a JOHN DOE yesterday and there might be another JOHN
DOE tomorrow so they will know which JOHN DOE
they're talking about when you're talking about

they would have had to put JOHN DOE No. 2.

OFFICER: In death cases you get a lot of JOHN DOES.
SIRHAN: How's that?

OFFICER: Well when an individual dies in some manner and has
no identification it shows the way they can be
carried as the JOHN DOE so through some type of
identification where we can ascertain who they are,
where they're from, that sort of thing you know.
Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it takes hours.
Sometimes you're never able to identify somebody.

“Iwill, but I'm not sure, I didn't understand your

No, I didn't ask a question. You said something that
there is many things you have to find out.

Well, that's right, we-took your fingerprints, we
checked you locally so we know that locally we have no
record of you nere, right, you Iknow as far as Los
Angeles is concerned at least none that has been ascer-
tained at this point but to check nationally this is a

OFFICER:

SIRHAN:

I've had a lot of people say to me alright now, say
therr in custody for some charge what's going to
happen now, what happens to me now. You have to tell
them, first of all we file a complaint, your arraigned,
then you'll have a preliminary hearing, then you'll be
arraigned in Superior Court, then you'll have a trial
in Superior Court, and these are things a lot of people
are not familiar with, and they ask that question a lot
of times, I've had that asked to me a lot of times,
what's going to happen. When do I go to court.

Let me ask you the same question. What's going to
happen?

What's going to happen to you? You're going to be
arraigned within the next day or so in a Municipal
Court, charges will be read to you, that's when you'll
be asked is your true name JOHN DOE which you'll have

to answer. And a date will be set for your preliminary
hearing, then you'll be held to answer for your pre-
liminary hearing, then you'll be arraigned in Superior
Court, then within 60 days after your arraignment in
Superior Court you'll be tried and the only other
alternative would be if the case was talen to the Grand
Jury and you were indicted then you wouldn't have a
preliminary hearing. After you were indicted by the
Grand Jury you would be taken into Superior Court and
arraigned on the indictment and then a trial date would
be set, in Superior Court within 60: days. There may be
a’ ‘preliminary hearing, there might be an indictment from
the Grand Jury, it depends on what the District Attorney
decides: to do. . .

That ts your job ha?

SIRHAN:

Not my job, I'm an investigator.
Yeah, but you know, your recommendation, etc.

Well, Mr. HOWARD's recommendation, he's a Deputy
District Attorney, he might take the case himself, he
may decide to take it to the Grand Jury, he may decide
to file a complaint, you either have an information or
an indictment. An information is a complaint, an in~
dictment is handed down by the Grand Jury. And, any
time in these proceedings an individual can plead, if
you plead guilty you cut down some of the time, if he
chooses to plead not guilty than he goes through the
regular routine and wind up in court, if you wind up in
Superior Court then you get a choice of a ceurt trial or
jury trial, it's again strictly up to you whatever you or
your counsel decides. And in all these proceedings you
can have an attorney present.

Oh, why is that?

Because that's the way the law operates. You have
to be represented by counsel.

One cannot defend himself eh? That's part of our thing.
Pro per.

Pro per.

The court has to be satisfied in their own mind and in
the judges mind that you are qualified to represent

yourself pro per.

What is the big doubt...

SIRHAN: Why, why is that? I mean, ah...

OFFICER: Ah, we just...

SIRHAN: I méan,..KIRSCHKE defended himself.

OFFICER: Well, KIRSCHKE was an attorney, though. That's a little

bit different...He's qualified to defend himself pro per. Because

he's a lawyer by profession. But the courts don't like to let an

individual defend himself pro: per because then it goes up on

appeal after conviction, and then a lot of times it's reversed,

sent. back for a new trial due to lack of defense, and it just
means doing the same thing all over again.

SIRHAN: Tell me all that again.

there, If you say that you don't know the make.....

SIRHAN: Where the place I going? When you say something, back
up. .

entered my mind at all until it was just brought up. My
statement was merely that you still don't remember the kind of
car you were driving. If you say you don't, I believe you,

SIRHAN: Oh hell. Any drummer's school doolk: wild tell you.
ANOTHER OFFICER: Possibly so, but I dare say if we lined up
one hundred thousand people out here, if we were capable of
it, we wouldn't find too many that would remember.

SIRHAN: Oh hell, your giving me too much credit.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, I don't give you too much credit. But
there is one thing we do. It is talk to a lot of people, now.
You give us the benefit of the doubt there. That we talk to
a lot of people.

SITRHAN: Well, right, I have to take.....

ANOTHER OFFICER: Say in a career. Mine. Short, like
fifteen years.

SIRHAN: This thing here is bothering me....this insulation.
ANOTHER OFFICER: Air conditioning?
SIRHAN: Whatever it is.

OFFICER: Sit over here.

ANOTHER OFFICER: What's it drafty?

OFFICER: Yeah. On yeah....s..

SIRHAN: By your men.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well......,very good BOB, Prior to your
meeting with him, have you been examined by a doctor or say
in the last three to six months?

SIRHAN: I don't really know. I never nad the occasion to.
I don't, well what would you want to go to a doctor for?

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, no. I don't know, I am not saying you
had to go, I just was curious if you have been examined.
Usually they, you know they take your, they measure you, take
your weight, and stuff litze that and thought if you had been
examined, it might refresh your memory, as to what you
weighed.

SIRHAN: Oh, I'd maybe say, rough..... maybe 120, You know.
You estimated 107, LOY or 117.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, I would like to fib and say 117, but I
said 107.

SIRHAN: Maybe.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You look like you have lost, nave you lost
any weight recently, I mean recently?

SIRHAN: Really. Maybe you know it fluctuates.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Yeah, I go through this, I go up and I come
down.

SIRHAN: Mr. MURPHY took a strong dose of accent (phonetic).
ANOTHER OFFICER: Careful now.

SIRHAN: No offense. I mean that in good jester, no kidding.
If he would loose four or five pounds, or six or seven.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You know some people could say the implication
was that Mr. MURPHY might have a over, be overly supplied with
defecation, or something, you know.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Another thing we haven't done well by you,
I'll have to admit, our tailor hasn't done justice to you.
That is not your size. I'll go for that.

OFFICER: They don't have tailored clothes around here any
more because they don't have any trustees any more do they?

ANOTHER OFFICER: But he does, he has got a ridiculously
small waist.

OFFICER: Yeah.
ANOTHER OFFICER: And I don't think they have seen anybody.
STRHAN: Really?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Yeah. They keep..... They stick pretty
much to the norm, the average, you know they don't.

OFFICER: What do you weigh? Around 120?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Hey, now I made a guess. We were all
guessing your weight out there and now I said 107. Who was
the closest?

SIRHAN: You were the least and the boys in your room estimate
150,

ANOTHER OFFICER: 150,

SIRHAN: It could-be any......because I honestly don't know
exactly.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well, I I'm sure it is not 150.

SIRHAN: I am sure of that myself, too. I don't feel 150.
But exactly how much.....

ANOTHER OFFICER: You really don't know.
SIRHAN: To the net pound, I don't know.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Have you been examined by a doctor recently
at all.

SIRHAN: No, well whatever it is tnat got really. I am open,
I explained that and he can take it whichever way he wants
or however way you want. I expressed it and I meant it in
good faith. You know. I mean. I don't ‘now. how he would
respond to it.

ANOTHER OFFICER: MERV and I are both used to things about
weight, Neither one of us get too exotted about that.

OFFICER: You sure you're not hungry?
SIRHAN: No, thank you.

OFFICER: We had better make that clear now, that you're not
hungry.

SIRHAN: You want to dissect my guts?

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, no, we just want to be sure that, that
if, like I told you......

OFFICER: For the record. If you have been offered food.
SIRHAN: I'll never deny that, I'll never deny that.

ANOTHER OFFICER: And I was going to say, if you were hungry,
but you were fearful of food, I would be glad to....

STRHAN: No,no. Please don't misunderstand ie.
ANOTHER OFFICER: Okay.
SIRHAN: If I were hungry, I would holler.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Do you know anybody named ROBERT GENE KENDROSE,
KENROSE, whatever?

SIRHAMN: ...0.+-...eROBERT, I know ROBERT, may>e JAMES, I did
not go to school with any JAMES,

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well specifically, do those three names
together ring a bell with you as anybody you know or have met?
SIRHAN: I honestly don't know, think so. I might meet him
in the future, I might never, you know. Or I might have met

him, you know, but forgot the meeting.

ANOTHER OFFICER: I doubt if you have forgot too many meetings
in your life.

STRHAN: Now why do you say that?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Just because you don't strike me as the kind
of person that forgets.

SIRHAN: Well, I don't forget.

OFFICER: No jour nat too forgétful.

SIRHAN: Why?

OFFICER: Because you're too intelligent.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Now, don't, don't give us modesty now.
SIRHAN: You going to give a psychology test or or,......test.
OFFICER: We don't have to.

SIRHAN: You don't have to. Oh, good.

OFFICER: We don't have to. Now, you got to go along with us
and give us a little credit. Like I say we talk to a lot of
people.

STRHAN: No, I, you're extending a lot of credit, but really
the credit, the guy that, you know, I'm not asking for.

ANOTHER OFFICER: I know you're not asking for it, you're getting
it because your responses....That's the only reason you're being,
if I thought you were a dumb bell by this stage of the game I'd
provably told you I thought you were a dumb bell. That's my

big problem. I got a big mouth and I, I say things sometimes

I shouldn't, but, but I don't, youtre not a, I think you of
all people would appreciate this. You're a challenge,
invigorating, you make the job interesting. If you're....

STRHAN: Make you work a little bit, huh?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Right, no that's good, now I don't know

what your field of endeavor is but IT am sure just the little
bit that I have talked to you that something that just comes

in and falls in your lap, you know you can take it or leave

it alone, but something you have to worl: for that's challenging,
it's interesting to you. I think I'm right.

SIRHAN: Well, it's, you know, like I said if you're going
to work puzzled, it's going to take you a long time and
you know, this one.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well, now see, there is where we differ.
STRHAN: They say I contradict myself, but that's myself,

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, no. That's right, we're all there,
That's what makes the world go round. Your, we are all similar
in some areas. We're dissimilar in others. That's fortunately
it that way. For us, we have to enjoy putting the puzzle
together. Each little piece as it goes into place you have

to get a little feeling of satisfaction, and after all, really
that's all this job is. If you ever stop to analyze it. I
know people view us as various, you know, the fuzz, the police,
the cop, and all that.

SIRHAN: Super fuzz.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Super fuzz, thank you. But you know what

we are? We're a bunch of mechanics. We try to take facts
that are presented to us and fit them into the right little
spot. I'm not carrying anything. So, in a way we are sort

of a mechanic, too. Like you might say, we got paid for doing
kids games, cause we're trying to put puzzles together. And
you're a good puzzle. It's falling into place, but you're a
good puzzle.
