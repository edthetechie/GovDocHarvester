RICHARD ALLEN COHEN advised that he resides with
his family at #3 Oak Park Court in Creve Coeur, St. Louis
County, Missouri... He is a 19 year old white, male, and 4
junior student at the Washington University in St. Louis.

Mr. COHEN recalled his-.activities on June 4 and’

June 5, 1968, while in Los Angeles, California. He had ac-
companied his sister-in-law. to San Diego, California, for

the purpose of visiting. his brother, who is in the military
service and who.was stationed there. Upon arriving at San
Diego, California, on June 4, 1968, he decided to go on to
Los Angeles because he had learned that former Senator ROBERT
F, KENNEDY was going to make a speech there. COHEN had pre-
viously been active in campaigning for Mr. KENNEDY in St. Louis.
He arrived at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on Jume 4,
1968, and registered for a room.there at about 8:00 a.m.

He remained at the hotel until 6:00 a.m. on June 5, 1968,
when he returned to San Diego,California, by air and contin-
ued his visit with his brother and sister-in-law until

June 10, 1968, when he returned to St. Louis, Missouri. He
had remained at the Ambassador Hotel alone and his decision
to go to Los Angeles had not been the result of any pre-
arranged plan. Upon arriving. in Los Angeles he contacted

the headquarters of Senator KENNEDY and volumteered to. work
campaigning or doing anything else that. he could ‘assist. in.
He was given assignments..to work in.the Los Angeles. community
campaigning for KENNEDY which he did untii about 1:00.on
. June 4, 1968. . Thereafter, he reported to the Ambassador
Hotel where he assisted. in. arranging and decorating two ball-
rooms at which Mr. KENNEDY was to appear. .The main ballroom
was located on the second floor of the hotel which also houses
the main- hotel lobby. A second ballroom was located on the
next lower floor.. During the course of the afternoon Mr.
COHEN had several occasions to.go into the kitchen area. ad-
joining the ballroom for the purpose of obtaining streamers
and other supplies. .On,these.occasions he has a recdlection
of having seen a number of the hotel employees, who he des-
cribed as "“Italian-Americans' and whom he believed to be kitchen
help, waiters and busboys. :

COHEN has no. reason to believe that any of these
individuals were SIRHAN SIRHAN. He does not know SIRHAN SIRHAN

and had never heard of him prior to the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY. He has no reason to believe that SIRBRAN SIRHAN

may have been in the kitchen or balircom area any time during
the afternoon of June 4, 1968.

“After completing the arrangements and decorating
of the ballroom COHEN returned to his room where he freshened
up and went to the coffee shop in the hotel and had his dinner.
Thereafter, he returned to the second floor ballroom at about.
7:00 p.m. and waited there «mtil Me. KENNEDY appeared amd
made his speech. He recalled seeing Senator KENNEDY leave
the ballroom by exiting through a door at the back of the
stage area. ‘Having worked in the ballroom during the after-
-noon COHEN realized that this door would probably lead through
a rear exit way and down to the ballroom one flight below where
Mr. KENNEDY was supposed to appear and speak to the young
people and students who were working for him. Inmediately
after Mr. KENNEDY left the room Mr. COWEN along withthe crowé
exited from the ballroom through the main door into the
lobby and just as he stepped through the door two men rushed
out of a.double swinging door tohis left leading. inte the
kitchen area and shouted “no one is dlowed in here, mo one is
allowed in here." They immediately tock positions guarding
the doors, to keep anyone from entering, Mr... COHEN t
nothing about this except that he believed that Mr. KENNEL
was, passing through that aree of the hotel and did not. want
to be delayed by a crowd of people rushing in there. COHEN
proceeded down the steps to the first floor bailroom and
just about the time he reached the foot of the steps he heard
tremendous screaming and commotion om the floor above and
immediately returned to the area of the main ballroom. Upon
arriving back to this area he observed considerable confusion
and heard some. people say that Mr. KENNEDY had been shot. He
does not recall who said this to him but it was a general
discussion going about through the crowd. He remained in
the main lobby outside the ballroom for a short while, he
does not recall how long, and realizing that there was nothing
that he could do he returmed to his room in the hotel. We was
accompanied to the room by four.voung ladies and their, chaper-
one who had been working in connection with Senator KENNEDY's
campaign. The chaperone had asked COMES if the girls could
stay at his room. They were as far as he knows local resi~
dents of the Los Angeles area and were not guests at the hotel.

COHEN related that he remained im his room until about 2:60
a.m. on June 5, 1968, and by this time some of the girls
who were quite tired were becoming hysterical and the cha-
perone asked Mr. COHEN if he would mind turning over his
room to them which he did. He them went to the lobby of the
hotel where he remained until 6:00 a.m. when he checked out
of thehotel, tok a cab to the airport and returned to San
Diego, California.

Mr. COHEN stated that at no time while he was at
the hotel did he ever see SIRHAN SIRHAN in the coffee shop,
corridors, in the lobby of the hotel, or in the ballrooms.
He stated that he had no information concerning this individual
and has no reason to believe that SIRHAN SIRHAN was part of
a conspiracy to assassinate Senator KENNEDY.

activities of those connected with Senator KENNEDY's camp.
