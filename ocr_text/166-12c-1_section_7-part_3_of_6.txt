case. STREAN was also sentenced to the term prescribed __

by law on each of the five counts of assault with_a dangerous ~

weapon with intent to commit murder in connection with

the five individuals who were wounded at the Ambassador
Hotel on the night that Senator KENNEDY was shot.

On May 3 1969, an article appeared in the
"Los Angeles Times" which advised that GEORGE E. SHIBLEY, «,
a Long Beach Attorney, announced that he would be joined
by LUKE MC KISSACK, a Hollywood Attorney, and ABDEEN JABARA
of Detroit, Michigan in assuming responsibility for SHIRHAN's
appeals. :

’ The article stated that the three attorneys who
represented STRHAN in his trialwouldserve ihn the capacity
of "counsels". to the three new attorneys. SHIBLEY indi-
cated in this article that the change was made at the re-
quest of the SI. N family as they wished to have a defense
team of attorneys with a background of Palestinian affairs.
The article stated that SHIBLEY and JABARA are of Lebanese
ancestry, although both were born in the United States.

JABARA was present in Los Angeles during the trial
of SIRHAN. .

LAWRENCE D. SOMMERVILLE, a student at Pasadena
City College, who resides at 1863 Elvado Avenue, Arcadia,
. - California, telephone 355-8395, advised that.on the evening
im of June 4, 1968, probably before 6:00 p.m., he saw SIRUAN B.
' STRHAN on ‘the steps leading from the student center to the
"G" Building at Pasadena City College. It appeared,

' SOMMERVILLE said, thet STRHAN was exiting the college as
SOMMERVILLE was entering. There were two or three other
males walking about the same pace as. SITRHAN, but SOMMERVILLE
could not state whether or not they were actually in his

company. , . .
a SOMMERVILLE waved to SIRHAN and spoke his name.
; STRHAN waved back and passed on.

: ‘SOMMERVILLE had known SIRHAW since junior high
school when both were in attendance at Elliott Junior High
School end again at John Muir High School in Pasadena,
however, SOMMERVILLE said he never had. more than possibly _
one class with STRHAN and this would have been in junior
high school. He doubts that STRYAN would know his name,

He has never been in the SXRHAN home, nor has SIRWAN been
in his home. SOMMERVILLE stated that they kmew each other
« ‘by sight only end would greet each other when they met,
- usually by a wave. SOMMERVXLLE stated he had no information
of consequence regarding SERHAN and no information whatsoever _
concerning his political attitudes and beliefs. . :

which was somewhere around a period ‘of “about 1b years Ir had 1 many oS
. conversations with SIRHAN., We both belonged to the PASADENA CITY. COLLEGE

: INTERNATIONAL CLUB, the club was composed of about 150’ foreign students.

.I would. say that from my own personal observations SIRHAN's best friend
“was another Arabic studentby the name of MOHAMAD (M-Arabic-Tall-Good
looking-Fair complexed). _ on. sos

_As far as any of the ‘teaching Stat £ knowing’ STRHAN, I believe that there

was a member of the Political Science program that "tT believe knew SIRHAN

. quite well (M-C, has only one eye-wears: artificial eye and glasses). I .

do remember that MISS NICELY who is the head of the International Students.
talked with SIRHAN and so did MR. RUDE from the ENGLISH DEPT. MISS ELDER

: also was the Foréign students English teacher and talked with SIRHAN,

Socially I did not know SIRHAN too well. Tr Know that he did not drink
' liquor and-I believe that he was a MOSLEM, He never told me this, but
' this is what I believe. . I also believe that his friend MOHAMAD was a
' Moslem.. SIRHAN was a héavy bettor at the race track. I know that he
“used to go to SANTA ANITA a lot. I myself go to Santa Anita but not as
much as he did, every time ‘that I did go, I used to see SIRHAN there.

- He used to make ‘big bets 60-80 dollars on a race. One time when we were

at Santa Anita a middle aged woman gave him a’ good tip on a horse and he
gave me the tap, ‘the norse came in and he made a lot of money on his bet.

No, SIRHAN did’ not have any girl friends that I know of, he was a very
quiet type of man and the only time that’I remember him talking to any

. ° girls was during our meetings at the International Club. I remember
- seeing him talking to a'girl by the name of "SUZIE" and another girl by

“the name of "SHARON" but I don't remember their last names. But to my

_. knowledge he didn't have. an girl friends. and I never saw him with a girl. |

. No, I truthfully can't say ‘where SIRHAN got his ‘money. I remember that

at one time he was working in a gasoline station in Pasadena. After he
left schoolssomewhere around the middle of 1964 I believe, I think it was

: 1964, anyway I heard that he was working horses in Del Mar. I think that |

his brother the one that wears a beard and works at the FEZ as a musician
got him the job in Del Mar. His brother is a much bigger bettor than
SIRHAN was, and I think that heiis the one that told me that SIRHAN was
working in Del Mar and that he had had an accident.

' When I saw SIRHAN at Santa. Anita in February of January. of this year I tol
him that I had heard about his accident, I asked him how he was feeling

., andthe told me that everything was alright. He’ was real happy. He told
me he felt fine but that he was suing tose People and that he was going
to get some money from them. ; ;

Yes, during the time that I knew SIRHAN he had | two cars first he had a.
1952 or 1953 black cadillac and then. the st car that he had was a real
big one, it was a huge reddish DeSoto but I am not sure of the year. Once
or twice he drove me home when I was Walking from school.

know of. I remember > seeing: him in the track in Senta inita during 1964

Well. “Politically 1 “now that STRHAN. was: “very mich against | the ‘Jewish .
people. He hated the Jews. In fact he stated to me many times that he
was for Hitler and the way that he handled the Jews. .He used to say that h
couldn't understand the Americans; that they let the Jews suck the blood

of the nation and keep putting the money in the Bankes and the Americans °

_ Let them get away: with its we wet Ua SiS ye ay are ;

SIRHAN was usually very quiet, “he ‘used 3 no > profanity, ‘except ‘sometimes he
used to swear in Arabic.: Once aman spilled some coffee on his brother’
in a restaurant in.H,llywood and SIRHAN called him a Mother Fucker in
_ But most of the time he was polit ;: helpful nd quiet but" he

at the time SIMIAN was running-the horse it was ‘extremely
foggy and SIRHAN apparently lost his bearings arid ran -
the horse into one of the fences almost directly in front
of him, RAMISTELLA, and the other onlookers. RAMISTELLA,
because of the fog, did not actually sce SIRHAN fall from
the horse:but heard the accident and ran to where STRHAN
was leying. SIRHAN was very much shaken by the accident.
and wes taken to the local hospital for tweatment. . The
hospital’ found nothing wrong, however, and released him
the next day. RAMISTELLA had an occasion to observe
SIREAN for some time following this accident and noted

- Local press reports reflect that on June 25, 1969,
SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN was acquitted in Pasadena Municipal
Court on the: charge-of creating a disturbance at St. Luke's
Hospital, Pasadena, on March 28, 1969 when he went to the
hospital to visit his brother, SAIDALLAH who had been injured
in a traffic accident.

SHARIF plead "diminished mental capacity" in his,
trial which was the same defense utilized ve SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN.

SHARIF testified that he had been under a doctor's
eareand had been taking pills and injections at the time of
the accident. SHARIF's attorney was GEORGE E, SHIBLEY.

The Pasadena Star News under date of July 9, 1969,
carried an article that reflected that a claim of an
estimated $100,000 for false arrest was filed against a
Pasadena Police Lieutenant and the City of Pasadena, by —
SHARIF B, SIRHAN, brother of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

SHARIF according to the article is claiming special .
damages for malicious assault and battery, ‘personal injuries,
false arrest and malicious prosecution.

The claim is the result of SHARIFSbeing arrested
in the Intensive Care War@ of St. Luke's-Hospital where his
brother, SAIDALLAH was confined. The claim was filed by
SHARIF!s attorney, GEORGE E, SHIBLEY of Long Beach, California,
- who defended him in the assault charge and who is a new addition.
to the appeal staff of SHARIF's brother, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

The "Los Angeles Herald Examiner" on June 24, 1969,
carried an article which reflected that the Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals has taken under advisement a move to deport

- MUNIR BISHARA STRHAN, 21 year old brother of SIRHAN BISHARA
_ STRHAN.

LA 56-156

The article reflects that the United States
Immigration Service had delayed action on the pending
deportation to avoid any possible influence on the
Los Angeles jury that convicted SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN of
murder.

. MUNIR . a native of Palestine and a citizen of ~
Jordan, has ‘been under deportation proceedings since he
was convicted of possession of marijuana on October 13,

1966.

The original deportation order was made on "grounds
‘of MUNIR's felony conviction.

MUNIR, according to this article, was sentenced
by a Los Angeles Supericr Court to oné year in jail and
five years probation. His attorney, however, persuaded the
court to vacate the sentence and to transfer it toa
juvenile court. MUNIQR was 19 when the incident occurred.
The Appeais Board of the Department of Immigration advised
that MUN 's attorney would be asked to submit a written
brief. . :

ousy waiting tables and was just a brief introduction. Mrs. ‘Young stated
that Tuesday night at The Fez is the night when all the Arabs of: the
communi ty come together, sing and dance, and socialize. She denied
«nowing anything about the political background of any of those who fre-
quent The Fez but did state that. a Sheila Peacock, of Jewish descent and
” yho" had been associated with various Arabs for approximately five to seven
years, told hey Young, on one occasion that a Mohammed, Asa or Isa, was

a big shot in the Arab political underground. This Isa or Asa frequents

_ that she would talk to her father first. Mrs. Young stated that she
usually worked for The Fez on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday nights. She
liked working at The Fez because the tips were very good; however, the

Arabs were poor tippers, and the American tourists tipped the best.

aever met him. She stated that the only law enforcement agencies she had
valked to briefly were detectives from Rampart Division. She maintained
shat she had never been interviewed by any member of the press, magazines,
