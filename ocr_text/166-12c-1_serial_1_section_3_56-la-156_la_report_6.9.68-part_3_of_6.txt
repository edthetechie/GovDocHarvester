SURVEILLANCE REPORT

January 25, 1968

MR. SIRHAN was spot checked from 1:30 p.m. to
4:30 p.m. on this date. Including travel time, three and one-
half hours were spent on this assignment this date.

_ The following is a brief summary of this date's
spot check.

1:30 p.m. Upon arriving at MR. SIRHAN'S residence in Pasadena,

. we attempted a direct contact. The door was answered
by MR. SIRHAN'S mother, who proved friendly and
related the following information.

MR. SIRHAN is currently employed, but his hours.
are quite irregular at this time. His mother

had no idea where he worked since he had told

her it was none of her business. “She went on to
say that he had attempted to return to work as

an exercise boy, but was unsuccessful, due to lack
of seniority.

After learning the above information, the contact
was ended. Since MR. SIRHAN'S mother had stated
that his hours were quite lrregular, we took up a
position of surveillance, assuming he might return
at any time. :

7 4:30 p.m. Since MR. SIRHAN had not returned, and further
a . surveillance seemed unwarranted, we discontinued

Surveillance commenced.

Aman, fitting MR. STRHAN'S description, departed.
the residence driving a Volkswagon. We followed i

him to the United Picture Frame Company , where
he parked and entered the building, going out of
view. As he was walking towards the building,
we exposed 30' of 16 mm . color film of this
activity. moe

After he had entered the building, we made a
Department of Motor Vehicles check of his vehicle.
It proved to be registered Adel B. Sirhan. We

then made an employment verification at the frame
company, and it_was learned that Adel Sirhan did.

work-theve;s. We then placéd a phone cali to MR.

STRHAN'S residence, and verified his presence at
home. It was also learned that the man the investi-
gator followed and photographed was MR. SIRHAN'S
brother. they are apparently very similiar in

appearance ; ‘

We then returned to PR. SIRHAN'S residence and
resumed surveillance...

MR. SIRHAN was first observed, as he was running
down the sidewalk. As he ran, we exposed 15' of
color film. &, STRHAN appeared to move in a free
and easy unrestricted manner.-

MR. SIRHAN arrived at the Organic Pasadena. This.

“then entered the store, going out of view. .

Since MR. SETRHAN was still in the store, we placed
a phone call and verified his employment at the

health food store. A short time later, we entered -

the store and observed MR. SIRHAN in the back room,
stamping smail bottles, to be put on the shelf.

Since it appeared that MR. SIRHAN would remain in
the building the rest of the day, we discontinued.

have suspended activity on this case until we

doctor in the field of eye, Maurice Nugent, dated October 10,
1967, that contains the coneluding opinions that applicant has
no permanent Gisability with regard to his eye. As a conse=
guence, the examination scheduled with Dr. Kiehn should be
eanceled forthwith. ;

We attach a copy of Dr. Nugent's report for your file.
There may be need of an orthopedic evaluation but for the moment,
we suggest you hold orf amy further examinations. The case is
off calendar and we antlelpate. that we wlll be served with -
further medical réports by the attorneys for applicant. At that

Dear Sir:

Mr. Sirhan Sirhan was seen again in my office on October 9, 1967. At this”
time he stated that he has not been working and that his symptoms are
essentially the same. He states he has pain in his low back and a feeling
of tightness around the left eye. He states that the sensation around the
left eye seems to be increased with cold weather.

EXAMINATION: Pupils are equal and react to light. Funduscopic examina~
tion is within normal limits, Extra-ocular movements are intact, There is
no nystagmus. Patient walks well on his heels and toes. Tendon reflexes
are active and equal bilaterally throughout. I found no pathological toe
signs. Patient reports tenderness on palpation over the upper sacrum,
Back movements are carried through a normalrange. Forward bending is
accomplished to a point at which the fingertips touch the toes, Straight

' leg- raising is accomplished to 85 degrees bilaterally.

Al .

MK COMMENT: I find no evidence of any neurological problem.. Relative to
the back problem, I believe the patient's condition should be considered
‘permanent and stationary, disability factors being subjective complaints
of low back pain that I would assess as minimal in degree. The patient's
eye problem should probably be evaluated by Dr. Kiehn. No return aopcint-
meni was made to sec this patient. If I may be of any further help in his
Care, please let me know.

Your Claim No.{

Gentlemen:

The above-ca aptioned case ‘set fox trial on October 2nd is being
. continued as the applicant's attorney has still not received
his medical evidence and has been advised that he probably
will not until the middle of October. So that all evidence
will be available at the time of trial, we have agreed to this
continuance to avoid the necessity of possibly two hearings.

Since the only issue is that of permanent disability, the
delay is not prej jedicial. :

worked around the bara for about two weeks and then resumed his work as an
exercise boy. He states that on resuming this work, he neted increased
discomfort, particularly around the left eve aud alsa kuw baek discomfort.

He was subsequently seen by the doctor who had originally treated him and
then was referred to two other dectors. Because the patient had swosequentiy
moved to his home in Pasadena, he was then referred to Dr. Kiehn in Pasadena

he felt that he was unable to physically work the hougs on the job that were
required of him. The patient rsports that he has not heen working since his

Jast few months. Ho deseribes the lett t eye complaints as being waves of

Cerebellar Bxamination; There is no nystagmus. [here is no atatla. Tandem
walk is well performed.
Reflexes: Tendon and superficial reflexes were active and equal bilateially.

I found no pathological toe signs,
Back Examination; Patient reports tendemess on palpation over the low
three limbar spines. There appears to be slight paraspinous muscle spism .
Inthe junbar region, Back movements were carried out through an essmtially
normal range, the patieni reporting low back pain at the extremes of these
movements. Forward bending {s accompHahed to a point at which the fnger-
tips touch the toes. Straight leg raising {s accomplished to 85 degrees
bilaterally, the patient st this time reporting low back pain.

IMPRESSION AND COMMENT: The patient reports that he was unconscous
at the time of his injury, although the medical reposts that I had availeble for
review did not verify this. At any rate, I found ne evidence of a neurdogical
problem at this time. The patient reports discomfort in the region of the
“facial scars, J believe there is a significant Sunettozal overlay that tends-to
~negnify these_complaints. > the patient reportedly custained a contusina of
his back at the time of his injury and currently has complaints of pain in his
low back. Arrangements were made for lumbar spine films, and J have asked
.the patient to return in about one month fer re-examination: Ibelfeve the
patient should be seen again by Dr. Kiehn for his re~evaluation relatve to
the scars and the complaints involving the left eye. I believe the patient 1s
capable of returning to work as a stable boy at this time.

Yours very truly,
