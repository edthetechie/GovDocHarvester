“We'll need some reading of

CRIMINAL DIVISION

The Attorney General
of the United States

The Capitol

Washington, D. C,

Dear Sir:

We receht Ly read an article in the San Diego Union
stating| that "a three-cell suite is being built for
| sithan. ..at a state medical facility....".

We were shocked, disgusted, and angered by this news,
Since this particular crime was committed "beyond

the shadow of a doubt" before numerous witnesses,
punishment should have been swift and sure, and if

the laws were upheld (those of the Constitution as

our forefathers wrote them) it shouldn't have taken
longer than 24 hours for the sentence to be carried out.

We are becoming ashamed of a country that has a judicial
system that would allow the farce of a trial such as
Sirhan's to be carried out - let alone prepare luxurious
quarters for him, Something is drastically wrong with

a system where justice is not the prime concern, but
where the defense is allowed to "win at any cost" and

at the taxpayer's expense,

We count it a privilege to live in this country, we
think it necessary to pay taxes for this privilege,

and after having been a member of the Navy for 23

years (my husband recently retired), we strongly protest
the molly-coddling of criminals while we pay for it,

We respectfully request that the laws in this country
be reviewed with the thought that the decent people
of this Land be protected, and the ones who would
destroy us, and the criminals be assured of swift and
sure punishment.

a earns F Respectfully yours

: Mr Kennetg Hahn

: Los Angeles County Supervisor

Los Angeles,C@lifornia

\

Dear Mr Hahn, / \
The news media have quoted you as saying the’Sirhan‘trial will

! cost over $1 million and you feel it is worth every penny. The reports
t state Los Angeles County must pay the bill. If all this is true, then
| I am glad you are supervisor in Los Angeles County rather than Brown
County,Minnesota.While we are being condition@d to accept large
| eSpenditures,this trial cost is a gross mishandling of the taxpayers
money.
It will take 2,500 families,working hard,paying an average of -
$400 a year in taxes to your county,to pay for this trial.These are
' the people who obey the law, work hard,save for their kids and for their
old age and pay their outrageous taxes. These are the people you should
be thinking about .These are the victims of prima donna attorneys and
"T-don't-care" public officials.

Why will the trial cost $1,000,000.00?What will the fee for the
defense attorney be? What wil the Psychiatrists fees be? Does the DA
get. extra fees for a case like this and how much?

Sirhan admited killing Senator Kennedy,so what is the fuss? He
is a foreigner - no matter what his papers say, and a foregner from
a nation of pedple know for violettand uncontrolled teppess. The
United States ,in typical childish and big hearted style, opened the
doors to too many immigrants from too many countries.This is one
result.We not only are allowing all kiddsand colors of immigrants,we
IMPORTED millions of Cubans- among who we will find some sabateurs
and perhaps assasins.When these people come overhere and assassinate
our repepected officials and then we spend $1,000,000.00 defending -
them - there is something radically wrong with us and our system.

The Trial is worth about $10,000.00 and nomore. Who is it that
is responsible for this Million ddllar trial? Can the defense
drag it out to any amount? What if they run it up to $10 Million
dollars? Is there no limit? T. me it is a prima donna,getting the !
spotlight and milking the taxBayer for all he can. I would hope there
is some public watchdog who will sue the ones respoksible for
this waste of taxpayers money. It is time them big spenders are
taught a lesson.

The President of the United States of America

White House
Washington, D, C.

Dear Mr. President:

I consider Judge Walker's response to Sirhan's demand for
justice (how ironic) a clear example of the injustice of the
Judicial branch of our Government today.

How ean the law abiding Citizen believe that Justice exists
and that it pays to be good under such conditions?

I consider you an honorable man of proper essential convictions,

that is why I am writing this letter, I want to live in a good America,

Respectfully yours
