ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Press reports indicate that Russell E. Parsons,
73-year-old Los Angeles, California, attorney, will serve
as Defense Counsel for Sirhan Sirhan, accused assassin of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy. For your information, there
follows a brief summary of information in our files concerning
Mr. Parsons,

In 1937, a Departmental Applicant investigation of
Russell Edward Parsons was initiated, which investigation was
discontinued at the request of the Department prior to
completion, The investigation which was conducted indicated
Mr. Parsons was born in 1893 and attended the University of
Southern California Law School for only one year, taking two
Subjects, one of which he failed. It is noted that Martindale-
Hubbell Law Directory indicates Mr. Parsons was born in 1895
and obtained his law degree at the University of Southern
California.

During the investigation, it was ascertained that in
1928, warrants for Mr. Parsons' arrest were issued by
Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties, California,
on bad check charges, which were subsequently dismissed.
He reportedly entered a guilty plea in January of 1928 to
charges of obtaining property by false pretenses, received
a sentence of six months, which sentence waS suspended,
and Mr. Parsons was placed on probation for two years, In 1934
he filed a petition in bankruptcy, which case was dismissed in’
March, 1935, without his receiving a discharge. Individuals
interviewed during the investigation, including judges, attorneys,
Clients and friends of Mr. Parsons, advised that they had never
known him to be involved in any trouble and considered him
capable, energetic, hardworking, forceful, a splendid orator,

Assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy
Los Angeles, California

loyal, trustworthy and honest. One attorney advised the
check charges mentioned above resulted from the failure

of other individuals to carry out their agreement to deposit
money to cover the checks which Mr. Parsons wrote.

Beginning in 1917, for two two-year terms,
Mr. Parsons served as County Attorney of Beaver County, Utah,
as well as City Attorney for Beaver City, Utah, returning to
Los Angeles in the mid-1930's to practice law. According to
Los Angeles press reports, hr. Parsons has become nationally
known as a trial lawyer in the area of criminal law... In
the late 1930's, Mr. Parsons joined the Los Angeles County
District Attorneys Office where he served aS a top prosecutor
assigned to special cases. These press reports indicate that
in recent years he has devoted his time to the practice of
both civil and criminal cases.

The files of this Bureau reveal that in 1942
Mr. Parsons was one of the attorneys for the officials of
Mankind United,who were indicted for violation of the Sedition
_ Statutes. ‘According to press reports in August of 1940,
Mr. Parsons, then Deputy District Attorney, Los Angeles,
California, was interested in prosecuting an old murder case
which he stated resulted from the investigation of communist
activities in the San Pedro, California, area. Mr. Parsons
was quoted as stating the murdered individual had been engaged
in anticommunist activities and had been killed during communist
attempts to infiltrate and destroy a union.

In 1959, Mr. Parsons was reportedly one of the featured
speakers at a State-Wide Conference on Criminal Law Reform
under the sponsorship of the National Lawyers Guild of
California. The National Lawyers Guild has been cited as a
communist front by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
In 1962, information was received from the Internal Revenue
Service in Los Angeles concerning an investigation being
conducted of Los Angeles attorneys for possible income tax
evzsion on the basis of "fee-splitting"™ with local bondsmen.
A Federal Grand Jury reportedly failed to develop any evidence
to substantiate the allegations.

activities in the field of bookmaking.

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

As mentioned previously, twenty-year-old Sandra Serrano
appeared on television shortly after Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot
and claimed that immediately after the shooting a woman in a polka dot
dress ran by her shouting ''We shot him. We shot him." According to
Miss Serrano, this woman had entered the Ambassador Hotel prior to the
shooting accompanied by two men, one of whom she identified as Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan. Extensive investigation has failed to substantiate her
story.

On June 21, 1968, after being afforded a polygraph examination
and an extensive interview by the Los Angeles, California, Police Depart-
ment, Miss Serrano admitted that her story was a complete fabrication.

An employee of the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte,
California, where Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was seen practicing with a
revolver on June 4, 1968, claimed that Sirhan talked with a blonde woman
at the gun club and it appeared the two had met previously. This woman
has been identified as Mrs. Claudia Williams. She advised she was at the
gun club with her husband, Ronald, on June 4, 1968, and Sirhan assisted
her on the pistol range while her husband was at the rifle range. Neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Williams had met Sirhan previously.

The receptionist at the office of Russell E. Parsons, Sirhan's
attorney, Los Angeles, received two telephone calls on June 20, 1968,
from a person claiming to be John Lawrence of New York City. This caller
said he was executive secretary of the Clemency Committee for Sirhan
Sirhan and that Los Angeles criminal attorneys are "Crooks" and will take
Sirhan "down the river." He also said "We are out to get Mr. Parsons" and
claimed that Parsons was being paid $150, 000 to represent Sirhan. He
said that there are 250, 000 Arabs who are militant and who are not going to
let Parsons get away with it. Parsons contacted the Los Angeles Police
Department and requested protection. The police Suggested | that he discuss

ASSASSINATION OF co
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

In connection with our investigation into captioned matter,
our Los Angeles, California, Office has reported that records of the
Selective Service Headquarters for the State of California show no

- registration for Sirhan Bishara Sirhan or his brothers Saidallah and

Munir Sirhan. The remaining brothers, Sharif and Adel Sirhan, are
both registered with Local Board 91, Pasadena, California.

Our Los Angeles Office in noting the failure to register for
the Selective Service Act on the part of Saidallah and Munir Sirhan
advised that all four brothers have apparently been cooperative with
the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department in connection with the
investigation into the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
They have readily furnished background information relative to the
activities of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. According to our Los Angeles
Office, further inquiry into the Selective Service status of Saidallah
and Munir Sirhan could possibly have an adverse effect upon what
appears to be their cooperative spirit thus far.

Accordingly, the Department's advice is requested as to
whether we should proceed further with these possible Selective Service
violations at this time.

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR
ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

The continuing investigation concerning Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan has revealed that he is a member of the Rosicrucian Order,
San Jose, California. This order is also known as the Ancient
Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC),

An official of this organization has advised that Sirhan
had a "corresponding membership" and did not attend regular
meetings. Several members of the Pasadena, California, chapter
of this order have advised that Sirhan attended a meeting at
Pasadena, California, on the evening of May 28, 1968.

Officials of the Rosicrucian Order have advised this
is a world-wide fraternal organization operating on a lodge system.
They advised it is nonsectarian and is not a religious order although
the ethics of the order adhere to Christian principles. They further
advised that the teachings of the organization do not interfere with
religious freedom of members and only law-abiding citizens over
21 years of age, of good repute, and believing in a "Supreme Being”
are eligible for membership. Members reportedly include a cross
section of all classes of people and total world membership is
claimed at approximately 90,000 people of which 45,000 are in the
United States. This order reportedly traces its origin back to the
"mystery schools or secret schools" in Egypt approximately
1500 years B.C., and is nonpolitical in nature.

On June 5, 1968, a search of Sirhan's automobile was
conducted by the Los Angeles, California, Police Department. This
search revealed a sales receipt from the Lock, Stock and Barrel
gun store, San Gabriel, California, reflecting the purchase of four
boxes of .22 caliber ammunition on June 1, 1968. Intensive
inquiries are continuing into this as well as all other phases of this
investigation,

My dear Mr. President:

The fatal gunning of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, should be investigated thoroughly;
should be treated as a National Crime, It should be prosecuted in a FEDERAL COURT,
and hot in a State Court, If this type of thing continues then DUELLING mst again
be made legal, so that, anchonorable man may at least have some defense against his
suspected enemies, This is the most uncivilized way. to defeat the loyal opposition
and this type of violence will not be tolerated by the American citizen.

This horrible murder must be made a Federal Offense. It must be made a NATIONAL CRIME

to hurt, injure, or kill, IN ANY MANNER, a political candidate or incumbent or appointee
or representative of the citizens of the United States. The accused or the indicted
murderer should be examined in the extreme by competent avpointed or elected psychiatrists
and psychologists.

This country is one of the very few left where leaders can be seen, heard and touched
and may it continue to be so. I would like to see certain leaders of other nameless
countries expose themselves so openly. There would perhaps be mass slaughter with no

weapons involved,

I was very disappointed when you announced that you would not try again for the
Presidency. You have done a tremendous job and Americans can count their lucky stars
that we have such men as you. You have inspired some great legislation and I'm certain
that you will see the fruits of your labor, God bless you Lyndon Johnson.

Sincerly yours,
