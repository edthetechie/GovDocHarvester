On Monday, May 6, 1968, Mrs. Lyman and I checked out of Room 6
at the MOIRA HOTEL, Trinity Street, Dublin. The Porter had
called earlier for a cab to pick us up at 9:00 A.M. to take us
to the Dublin Airport for departure on B.E.A. Flight #862, at
10:00 A.M. for London.

The cab had a RYAN'S sign on top. Since I had met Mr. E. J. O'Carroll,
Dublin Manager of RYAN'S CAR HIRE LTD., I asked driver if he knew him.
He said he did. He explained that he owned his cab, personally.

I asked driver if he had lived in Dublin a long time. He replied
that he was a * man.

We talked about Robert Kennedy. Driver said, “If he runs, they
will shoot him just like they did his brother". I asked what

he meant. He said, "I don't want to talk about it". I asked why
not. He replied, "I have my reasons".

Driver's age 65-70. Sturdy, but not fat. 5'10" tall. Wore cap.
White hair showed under cap. Ruddy complexion. Bitter attitude.

* He named a suburb of Dublin. I think he said "DUN LAOGHIRE”.

first mantijnhed a “possible sus"
pect” and then named Sirhan
—"that should not ba done.”

He said the foreman next
identified and accused Sirhan—
“He haz no right opening a ses-
sion of tha grand jury. People
are reading these things. These
things are going all over the
country.” . a

‘NOT FAIR’

“He,” said Kelly, “keeps re-
ferring to the ‘suspect Sirhan,’
saying he was disarmed and
taken into custody. That's not
fair conversation from the fore-
man.” .

Kelly said the foreman’s ask-
tog of the medical examiner. his
identity and qualifications was
a leading question. “He should
have made him qualify. what
his training, education aud ex-
perience was. He's qualifying
him by the question.’”

’ Kelly also criticised the Los
Angeles grand jury foreman’s
us@ of the words, " bink, might
and may’ in questioning wit-
nesses. “You don’t go by think-
ing in the courts,” he declared.
‘Thinking, might and may are
out.” oo.

“The man was, ia my book,
improperly indicted. I’m speak-
ing also as a man who says it's
tragic that candidates for pub-
Te office, or holding public of-
fice, cannot express their views
on a public question without be-
ing assassinated.

HASTE RAPPRD

“There was no need of rush-
ing for the indictment. There
was no need to rush—the man
was in custody.”
. Fr. Drinan described himself
as “disturbed” that the tran-
Script had been released. He
sald a defendant ordinarily
would have to waive his right
to secrecy to bring about re-
lease of such testimony, ‘‘and
this could only have been done
‘by @awyer, and Sirhan does

a)

not have a lawyer yet to my
knowledge.”

Fr. Drinan related, “I have
never heard of such a thing, I
was’ amazed. This could pre-
clude the possibility of a fair
trial.”

He said a lawyer could argue
that this may be a “reversible
error,” but he predicted “a
qualified lawyer might just
plead the guy.”’ Fr. Drinan said

‘}the County of Los Angeles

“prejudiced the assumption of
innocence in the Sirhan ease.”

“The press and the county
should not prejudice the pre-
sumption of innocence. We pre-
sume a man is ‘innocent until
he is proven guilty beyond ev-
ery reasonable doubt.”’

Atty. Chase declared:

“I gather that the police out
there have been most scrupu-

Jous in the way they’va been
handling this case. I seriously
question the propriety of any
newspaper in printing tha testi-
mony of the grand jury.
It might well be a violation of
Sithan’s constitutional rights.
It's _& pretty serious thing to
publish proceedings of this sort.

“This whole thing is under

feonsideration presently in Mas-

sachusetts.

(Eds. note: a legislative com-
mission ig ‘studying tha prob-
lem.)

‘POOR POLICY’

“It's inevitable that in this
case With such tremendous pub-
lic interest that the newspapers
will pick up as much on it as
they can. Any normal citizen 1s
going to know an awful lot
about it before going on the
jury. This endangers the right
of free trial.” . .

Atty. Bailey attacked as
“very poor policy” the verba-
tim release of tha grand jury
testimony.

“There is no safecuard thak
this testimony is raliable or ad-
missible,” he said. “The only

. os

remedy in this case is to post-

pone the trial. a

“California, up to this point,
had started out doing an ex-
eellent job on tha case.-

“Too much pre-trial publicity
cannot cause acquittals. Hf the
evidence and publicity Is the
same, then noWody gets off. But
if the evidence is false and the
publicity the same, then he’
get off.” .

Bailey noted that “a lot of
what was printed was not evi-
dence” in the case of Dr. Sam
Sheppard of Cleveland, whose
release he won after the doctor
earlier had been found guilty of
murdering his wife.

Bailey sald of statements to
the press in the Kennedy assas-
sination by Los Angeles Mayor
Samuel Yorty, ‘If Yorty makes
a false statement that can't be
proved in court, and if that
statement is printed in the pa-
pers, then any conviction of
Sirhan could be reversed.”

He said it was possible the
Sirhan trial might be postponed
or moved to another court,
“but it won't be quashed before
it begins.” Also, Bailey said,
the release of the testimony

“eannot contribute toward an
acquittal.” TY

at that time that he was working at.a.tire manufacturing |... -
company. ALTFILLISCH said that DONNARUMMA was hopelessly

‘in debt when he had left Riverside, California, and is «0 sto

protably in the same situation in the Newark area.

The Newark Office conducted investigation in that
area but was unable to locate any address for FRANK
DONNARUMMA. Records of the New Jersey State Police concerning
horse track employees, trainers and owners reliected a
SALVATORE DONNARUMMA of Brooklyn, New York, and a SEBASTIAN F,
DORMARUMMA of Philadeiphnie, Pennsylvonia, who were connected
in an owner and trainer capacity at the Freehold Raceway.

Both of these individuals were interviewed but claimed not to
be related to or to have any knowledge of FRANK DONNARUMMA.

The records of the Riverside Sheriff's Office in
Riverside, California, where DONNARUMMA was arrested as
HENRY DONALD RAMISTELLA on 7/4/67, were reviewed, but no
information was developed that would indicate the present
lecation for DONNARUMMA.

Information was also received concerning
DONNARUMMA from the New York Office based on information
received from SPENCER DRAYTON, Executive Vice President,
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Buresu (TRPB). DRAYTON vas
contacted by representatives of "Life" magazine concerning the
fact that DONNARUMMA had been a friend of SIRHAN B, STRHAR,
DRAYTON stated that according to their records this
individual was HENRY RONALD RAMISTELLA, also Known as Frank
Donnarummea, whose date of birth was His
Social Security No. was and his FBI No.
was 365 697-C. TRPB records contain infermation concerning
reported violations in connection with horse racing on the
part of RAMISTELIA up until 1956 when the stevards at the
New York tracks barred RAMISTELLA from employment, however,
no forrel ruling to that effect was issued.

In Janvary 1956, RAMISTELLA was Tinserprinted at
Santa, Anita Raeetrack under the nae ot FRANK DONHARUBAA ,
TRPB records contain no informatia.which would indicate the
current whereabouts of DONHARUMMA. Set forth below is
identification record of RAMISTELLA under FBI No. 365 697.~¢,
