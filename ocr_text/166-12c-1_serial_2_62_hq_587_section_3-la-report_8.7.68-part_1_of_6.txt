ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign and a geologist reported on June 6,
1968, that he overheard two unknown males speaking in Arabic
at KENNEDY Headquarters in Los Angeles on June 3, 1968. WOOD
interpreted their remarks and stated that one of the statements
made was, "Well, we didn't catch up with him last night, but
we will tonight".

The following investigation was conducted in

Mrs .WARGUERTTE SWEENEY, housewife, 20055 Wells Drive,
Woodiand Hillis, California, telephone Number 3447-9910, related

the following:

Mrs. SWEENEY said that she had been.in charge of the
office work at the, Campaign Headquarters of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY, 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, from the time
it opened in March 1968, until the evening of June 4, 1968.
She said that during this period she had no recollection of
observing any volunteer worker'‘or. any person at all who, in
her opinion, resembled the photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN that
had been published and who had been arrested in connection with
the shooting of Senator KENNEDY.

Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN taken by the Los Angeles
Police Department on June 5, 1958, were exhibited to Mrs. SWEENEY,
who further confirmed her opinion that she had no recollection
of seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN at any time other than pictured on
television and in the newspapers.

_ Mrs, SWEENEY related that three volunteer workers
at the Headquarters had reported that they had thought that
they had seen a person closely resembling SIRHAN SIRHAN at the
Headquarters within the past few days. They were ELLENORE
SEVERSON, who worked on the information desk: LARRY STRICK, who
was an office assistant, and WILLIAM HENEBRY, who had worked
in the department correlating telephone calls and transportation.

Following the announcement that SIRHAN was of Jordanian
descent, there was speculation among some of the volunteer workers
that a Mr, KHATBER KHAN may have known SIRHAN, Mr. KAHN, as weil
as a number of young persons of student age, whom he brought in
for volunteer work, appeared to be of Middle East extraction.

They were dark and had features common to the Arabian and adjoining
countries.

Mr. KHAN, age 50 to 55 years, claimed birth in Persia.
He had a dark complexion, a large head, strong facial features.
. dark graying hair, heavy shoulders, and a stocky build. He is

She said Mr. KHAN brought in a number
of persons who reportedly were Students who worked as volunteer
workers in the campaign. There were usually six or seven at a
time and they had been given telephoning assignments. Mr. KHAN
did not handle any specific assignment but more or less correlated
the activities of the persons that he brought in.

Mrs. SWEENEY recalled that Mr. KHAN had brought in
one girl he claimed to be a relative. She was on crutches,
and Mr. KHAN had a splint or cast on his arm. All volunteer
workers were registered and in all probability a record of the
workers brought in by Mr. KHAN would be among those retained
by the KENNEDY Headquarters. Sone of the registrations for
volunteer workers had been placed on cards, others had registered
on long sheets of paper. JUNE ISACKSON, who lives on Malcom
Street in West Los Angeles and has telephone Number 474-5239, had
access to the records at the KENNEDY Headquarters, now closed,
and should be contacted if it is desired that these records be
examined,

Mrs. SWEENEY continued that Mr. KHAN had related during
some of their limited conversations with her that he was acquainted
with Senator KENNEDY and that he was known for his support of
Senator KENNEDY's policies. This resulted in some objection to
his support of Senator KENNEDY by the Shah of Iran but no
elaboration was made on this statement.

The only address that Mrs. SWEENEY ever had on Mr. KHAN
was 105542 Wilshire Boulevard. He furnished a telephone Number
of 475-1849, He also mentioned that he was known as "GOODEY"
and his friends called him "GOODEY". She said that she understood
that the volunteer workers brought in by Mr. KHAN had also used this
Wilshire Boulevard address on the records.

Mrs. SWEENEY commented, after examining a photograph
of SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN, taken December 18 1963, and of ADEL
SIRHAN, taken June 5, 1968 both brothers of STRHAN SIRHAN, that
she had no recollection of seeing at any time the individuals in
these photographs.

Following attempts to contact Mr. KHAIBARKHAN by tele-
phone for an appointment, the latter called Special Agent LESLIE F.
WARREN on June 8, 1968, and arranged for an interview in the pre-
sence of his attorney on June 10, 1968. Consequently, Mr. KHAN
was interviewed in the presence of his attorney, Mr. JACK CORINBLITH,
a member of the firm of CORINBLITH and SHAPERO (M. MARTIN SHAPER@),
Suite 575, 3700 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.

Following Agents! identification to Mr. KHAN and Mr.
CORINBLITH, they were advised that the inquiry was being made in
connection with the assassination of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and
information had been received by the Los Angeles Office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that Mr. KHAN had been working
at the Senator KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters, 5615 Wilshire Boule-
vard, Los Angeles, for several days prior to the June }, 1968,
primary elections; further, that Agents desired to show certain
photographs taken by the Los Angeles Police Department of Mr. SIRHAN
SIRHAN, who had been arrested and charged with the murder of Senator
KENNEDY, the purpose being to ascertain whether or not SIRHAN had
been observed at the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters.

Mr. KHAN said that before he examined any photographs or
submitted to any questions, he wished to make known to the Agents
his identity and his background with respect to his relationship
with Senator KENNEDY. In substance, he stated that he was an
Iranian national, who had been living in the United States for a
number of years.. In 1963 he had testified before the Senate Perma-
nent Sub-Committee on Investigations, headed by Senator JOHN L.

MC CLELLAN, Chairman. KHAN had testified that certain foreign aid
funds given to Iran were being misappropriated and made claims that
certain officials of the Iranian government were using these funds
for their own purposes and were paying off certain members of the
United States Embassy in Iran at the time. He said his testimony
was a matter of recerd. His interest in this testimony was to see
that the aid funds were used to support the poor and needy people
of Iran. Both former President JOHN F. KENNEDY and Senator ROBERT

F, KENNEDY had been sympathetic to Mr. KHAN's endeavors to see that
the foreign aid funds were directed to the proper recipients in
Iran.

Through Mr. KHAN's attorney, RICHARD H. WELS, 31 Madison
Avenue, New York, New York, the support of ROBERT KENNEDY had been
sought, and Mr. KHAN said that he had been personally introduced
to ROBERT KENNEDY by his attorney at that time.

Subsequently, Mr. KHAN had supported the policies of
President JOHN F. KENNEDY and Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY and more
recently had supported the Presidential campaign of ROBERT KENNEDY.

Mr. KHAN said he had been residing in New York City but
hed come to Los Angeles early in 1968, and that from June 1 through
June lL, 1968, he had personally spent considerable time at Senator
KENNEDY's Campaign Headquarters, working on behalf of Senator
KENNEDY.

Mr. KHAN produced a number of documents which he said
would reveal his identity and substantiate certain of his statements
as to his background, and that copies would be made available.

These documents, copies of which were made available, are
attached and are identified as follows:

1. Data concerning birth on letterhead of Iranian
Embassy, Washington, D. C., dated June 28, 1962.

2. Data concerning visa issued at London, England,
July 20, 1962, bearing Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service stamp noting admitted at Champlain,
New York, and dated April 9, 1963.

3. Press release dated May 16, 1963, captioned
"Senate Permanent Sub-Committee on Investiga-
tions of the Committee on Government Operations",
released by Senator JOHN Le MC CLELLAN, Chairman.

4. Letter dated June 21, 1965, from ROBERT F.
KENNEDY, U. S. Senate, to Mr. RICHARD H. WELS,
31 Madison Avenue, New York, New York,
acknowledging receipt of a letter sent to
Senator MC CLELLAN about the KHAIBAR KHAN matter.

S. Letter from JOHN L. MC CLELLAN, Chairman of the
Committee on Government Operations, U. S. Senate,
dated November 20, 1964, to Mr. RICHARD H. WELS
dealing with the possibility that information
contained in the files of the Sub-Committee may
have been made available by some means to the
Iranian Embassy.

Mr. KHAN stated that in 1963 he had registered as a repre-
sentative of a foreign principal with the Registration Section of
the Internal Security Division of the U. S. Department of Justice,
and that this was a matter of record with the Department of Justice.
This registration had been in connection with the organization which
had supported Mr. KHAN'S endeavors in the United States to direct
foreign aid to the poor people of Iran, and which had supported Mr.
KHAN's claims of irregularities in the handling of these funds. He
explained that he had met considerable opposition from the Shah of
Iran and consequently could not go back to Iran and survive. He
had, therefore, sought to be lawfully admitted to the United States
for permanent residence. He said a bill for the relief of KAIBAR
KHAN in this respect had been introduced into Congress in May 1967.
To support this claim, Mr. KHAN made available a copy of a section
of the Congressional Record, which showed that H. R. No. 1059 had
been introduced on that date by Mr. SCHEUER. Also furnished was a
copy of the bill so introduced in the 90th Congress, First Session,
on May 15, 1967. (See Attachments 6 and 7.)

Mr. KHAN also furnished a copy of a letter dated October
29, 1963, from J. WALTER YEAGLEY, Assistant Attorney General,
Internal Security Division, to Mr. EB. HARING CHANDOR of New York,
New York, which disclosed that Mr. CHANDOR wished to amend a regis-
tration statement filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of
1938, Registration No. 1638, on the basis that CHANDOR did not
anticipate any further activities on his part on behalf of the
KHAIBAR KHAN or his organization which would necessitate notice to
the Registration Section. (See Attachment 8.)

A copy of the April 12, 1965, issue of the publication
"The Nation", which contained an extensive article dealing with
the activities of KHAIBAR KHAN, written by FRED J. COOK, was made
available to Agents for examination and copy, with the request that
it be returned to him. He said that this article gave an accurate
account of his activities and allegations concerning the misuse of
foreign aid funds of the United States Government in Iran. (See
Attachment 9.)

Mr. KHAN was asked whether or not he had ever used the
name GOODARZTAN. He replied that he had previously been known as
KHATBAR KHAN GOODARZIAN, but that he had dropped the name GOODARZIAN
and legally changed his name to KHAIBAR KHAN. He said he was still
known by the nickname of GOODY. He was informed that Agent WARREN
and Agent LLOYD 0. BOGSTAD had in an attempt to locate him contacted
his ex-wife, TALAT KHAN, his son, AMIR HOSSAIN KHAN, and his daugh-
ter, SHIRIN KHAN, personally at their apartment, 1055l4s Wilshire
Boulevard; also, that Agent WARREN had talked to another son,
PHILLIPE KHAN, by telephone from the apartment on June 10, 1968.
The ex-wife at that time had acknowledged that her husband, from
whom she was divorced, had at one time been known as GOODARZIAN and
was also known as GOODY.

Mr. KHAN mentioned that he was reluctant to furnish his
residence address, as he anticipated reprisals and bodily harm from
representatives of the Iranian government because of his opposition
to the Shah's policies. He called attention to a splint and a cast
on one hand and stated that he had been the victim of an assault
in West Los Angeles near his ex-wife's apartment, which occurred
earlier this year, about March or April 1968. The exact date and
details, he said, would be a matter of record with the Los Angeles
Police Department in their West Los Angeles Division. He claimed
he had suspicions that he was assaulted as a result of his political
activities but did not elaborate further.

It was mentioned by Mr. KHAN that he had owned property
in Iran, including the building which housed the American Embassy
in- Tehran, and that the U. S. Government had rented from him for
some period but had stopped renting from him when he had made the
allegations against personnel of the American Embassy.

Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN taken by the Los Angeles
Police Department on June 5, 1968, following SIRHAN's arrest on
the charge of shooting Senator KENNEDY were exhibited to Mr. KHAN,
who stated that he believed that he had seen the individual whose
photographs he examined at the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters on the
late afternoon of election day, June 4, 1968. His recollection was
that he saw the person believed to be SIRHAN around 5:00 or 5:90 P.M.
on that date, first observing him walking into the headquarters
through the back entrance. KHAN said he later saw the person
thought to be SIRHAN standing in the headquarters near the water
bottle. He at this time was standing near a young girl, but Mr.
KHAN could not say that they were together or were even talking,
but they were standing about two feet apart face to face. He had
seen this young girl at two different times previously, once on

- 624 -

LA 56~156

June 3, 1968, sitting in a Volkswagen outside the KENNEDY Head-
quarters, and again earlier on June 4, 1968, in the headquarters.

He did not know who the young girl was. He described her as being
Caucasian, in her early 20's, 120 to 125 pounds, "good figure and
nice legs", large dark eyes, round face, light brown shoulder length
hair. When seen on June }, 1968, about 5:00 to 5:30 P.M., she was
wearing a two-color dress with short sleeves, part of which was
light and part of which had small round spots on it which appeared
to be either black or blue.

Mr. KHAN said his attention had first been attracted to
this young girl in question when he had seen her sitting in a blue
Volkswagen on a street that ran beside the Campaign Headquarters.
It was some time around mid-afternoon. There was a young male
Caucasian, possibly American, in the car with the young girl at
that time when KHAN was walking beside the car, and he overheard
the young man say, "I just spoke to Miss LAWRENCH, but LILLIE said
it was impossible." This attracted the attention of Mr. KHAN, as
he was personally acquainted with one LILLIE LAWRENCE, an Iranian
who was the wife of an American, but who lived in New York. He
Gid not get a good look at the young man in the car but thought he
had seen him in the past, but the young man turned his head, and
Mr. KHAN did not see him sufficiently to recognize him.

On the basis of overhearing this statement, Mr. KHAN
had some interest in the young girl in question, as he thought she
might be an Iranian girl. He had been asked earlier by one LARRY,

a. volunteer worker at the Senator KENNEDY Headquarters, if
he had seen the Iranian girl. Mr. KHAN is not sure the correct
name of the man is LARRY, but it is something similar. Con-

sequently, when Mr, KHAN observed the man believed to be SIRHAN and
the young girl standing near one another at the water cooler, at
which time the young girl appeared to be pouring coffee, he was
interested in who she was and left seeking LARRY to ask the latter
if the girl by the water cooler were the Iranian girl LARRY had
mentioned. He recalled that he asked another volunteer
worker, a man who is a rather heavy build and whose wife reportedly
was a telephone operator at the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters, if
he had seen LARRY. During the approximate ten minutes that Mr.
KHAN was seeking LARRY unsuccessfully, he returned, and by this
time the man thought to be SIRHAN and the young girl had disappear-
ed. He had no recollection of seeing them subsequently.

It was possible, according to Mr. KHAN, that photographs
of the young girl end the man thought to be SIRHAN were taken, as

about 5:00 to 5:30 P.M., some persons were shooting movie scenes

of the campaign headquarters who reportedly were Swiss photogra—
phers making a film dealing with American political campaigns. It
was noted that they made sweeping shots of the room at the time.
The identity of the Swiss photographers was not known to Mr. KHAN,
who was of the opinion that they would probably be known to Mrs.
MARGUERTTE SWEENEY yo appeared to be in charge of the office opera-
tions of the KENNEDY Headquarters at the time.

Mr. KHAN was asked if he were in the campaign headquar-
ters on Sunday, June 2, 1968, at approximately 2:00 P.M. He said
that he was in there on Sunday, but he thought it was later. He
said he had no recollection of seeing the person thought to be
SIRHAN at that time. He was advised that the FBI had received in-
formation that two of the volunteer workers, a young high school
student named LARRY and a woman who worked on the information desk,
had observed amm thought to be SIRHAN standing near the front
entrance of the campaign headquarters around 2:00 P.M. on June 2,
1968, at which time Mr. KHAN was standing near the information desk;
further, that when the young LARRY had asked the man thought to be
SIRHAN if he could help him, the man replied, "No, thank you, I'm
with him", and pointed in the direction of Mr. KHAN standing near
the information desk, which was several feet away.

Mr. KHAN said he had no recollection of this incident
or of seeing Mr. SIRHAN at that time, and he had no recollection
of ever seeing Mr. SIRHAN prior to the late afternoon of June lh,
1968, at the headquarters. He continued that he had seen pictures
of SIRHAN on television and in the press and thought at the time
that he looked familiar and wondered whether he might have seen
him at the KENNEDY Headquarters.

Mr. KHAN was further advised that co-workers at the
KENNEDY Headquarters had advised that Mr. KHAN had brought in a
number of young people of Middle Hastern descent into the KENNEDY
Headquarters as volunteer workers during the three or four days
prior to the election, and that it was thought that SIRHAN might
have been among this group, or possibly known to Mr. KHAN or some
of the persons he brought in.

Mr. KHAN related that he had brought four of his children
in there and his half-sister; also, that he had told them to bring
their friends and anyone else who might be potential volunteer
workers for Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. KHAN mentioned that there was an incident which
occurred when he and his half-sister, MARYAM, left the campaign
headquarters on June lL, 1968, around 8:00 P.M. A young man, an
American in the early 20's, had asked MARYAM, who was in their car
outside the headquarters, if they were going to the Ambassador
Hotel. When MARYAM informed him they were not but were heading
toward West Los Angeles, this young man asked her for a ride. He
was in the car when Mr. KHAN came out of the headquarters. This
young man asked Mr. KHAN if he would give him the KENNEDY button
he was wearing so that he might use it to get into the Ambassador
Hotel where the KENNEDY campaign party was to be held. KHAN
declined, and the young man was most insistent. He wanted KHAN
to go back into the headquarters and get him a KENNEDY button or
press pass or something which would enable him to get into the
party at the Ambassador Hotel. Mr. KHAN again declined, and the
young man was dropped off in the vicinity of Westwood Boulevard
and Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles shortly after 8:00 P.M.
Mr. KHAN said he had the name and address of this young man, but
that it was not with him, and he would furnish it later.

At this point Mr. KHAN and his attorney suggested that
the interview be terminated, as it was getting late, and that it
be continued at a later date. Mr. KHAN and his attorney, in the
presence of Agents, stated that they would discuss the possibility
of further contact with Agents, and the possibility of Mr.
CORINBLITH not having to be present would be considered. He said
Agents would be contacted the following day and would be advised
accordingly.

Mr. KHATBAR KHAN, telephonically contacted
SA LESLIE F, WARREN on June 11, 1968, and said that he and his
attorney, JACK CORINBLITH, had agreed that Mr. KHAN could
continue his discussion. of the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
assassination, with Agents of the FBI, without Mr. CORINBLITH
being present, Mr. KHAN arranged for a personal meeting later
that date, stating that he was to have his half-sister,
MARYAM KOUSHAN who is also known as Rose Khan, with him as
she had some information which may be of interest.

Consequently, Mr. KHAN was interviewed in the
presence of his half-sister, at which time he related the
following:

KHAN identified his current address as Suite 201,
at 1215 Ocean Avenue, ~.. Santa Monica, California. His half-
sister resides in Suite 206 at this address. He has no
private telephone, but can be reached through the switchboard
at this apartment, telephone number EX 3-0227.

it was explained that the half-sister, who was noted
to be using crutches, had been thrown from a horse while riding
in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, about six months previous, which
had injured her hip and resulted in her not being able to put
weight on one leg during this period. The horse was startled
by what Mr. KHAN thought was a shot of some sort, but he was
never able to confirm this belief, MARYAM was taken to the
Los Angeles County General Hospital following the accident and
there used the name of ROSE KHAN. He said that MARYAM had been
in the Senator KENNEDY compaign headquarters at 5615 Wilshire
Boulevard as a volunteer worker from June 1 through 4, 1968 and
could confirm to some degree some of the information that he
had furnished to Agents WARREN and WILLIZ R, WHITE on June 10,
1968, when they were in the office of Mr. CORINBLITH.

KHAN said neither he nor his helz sister hed gone to
the Ambassador Hotel on the evening of June 4, 1968 and he could
furnish nothing regarding the activities of the Senator's campaign
party that evening.

Concerning the young man to whom KHAN and his half-sister
gave a lift from the KENNEDY campaign headquarters to West
Los Angeles, California, at approximately 8:00 p.m. on June 4,
1968, previously related by Mr. KHAN on June 10, 1968, the
following is a description and name of this person, which
Mr. KHAN exhibited on a piece of paper as MICHAEL WAYNE,

1430 South Hi Point Street, Number 105, Los Angeles,
California 90035, male, white, age-early twenties, five
feet eight inches, skinny build, who claimed to have been
born in Manchester, England and his parents are British, his
father a salesman, No British accent was noted during the
conversation with this individual. This young man, who had
a reddish complexion and longish brunette hair, was thought
to have been a volunteer worker at the KENNEDY headquarters, .
as he was carrying a roll of what appeared to be campaign
posters. He had attempted to get Mr. KHAN to give him, or
otherwise obtain for him,a KENNEDY button or pass which would
enable him to get into the Ambassador Hotel during the
KENNEDY campaign party scheduled for later that evening.

As previously related by Mr. KHAN, this man had been quite
insistent he obtain this button or pass. The significance
of this incident with this young man was not known to Mr,
KHAN, who claimed he had not seen this young man around the
headquarters and had no way of associating him with SIRHAN
SIRHAN, who had been charged with the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY, or the girl who was mentioned by Mr, KHAN the
previous day as being possibly associated with the person
thought to be SIRHAN at the KENNEDY campaign headquarters

at approximately 5:30 p.m. the evening of June 4, 1968.

Mr.KHAN said he had personally met Senator KENNEDY
in Washington, D. C. and in New York, through KHAN's attorney,
Mr. WELS, as related during the discussion with Agents on
June 10, 1968. Mr, KHAN said he had met PIERRE SALINGER, former
press agent for JOHN F, KENNEDY at Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's
campaign headquarters in Los Angeles during the current
campaign, but that he was not intimately acquainted with
Mr. SALINGER or the late Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

Concerning the motion picture crew reportedly from
Switzerland, who were taking photographs of KENNEDY campaign
headquarters at around 5:30 p.m. on June 4, 1968, previously
related by Mr. KHAN, the latter said he could not furnish any
further identifying data except there seemed to be a crew,
andMrs. MARGUERIT: SWEENEG who was in charge of the office at
KENNEDY campaign headquarters could probably identify them.

Concerning the identity of individuals who had
come to the KENNEDY headquarters as volunteer workers,
reportedly at Mr, KHAN's request, he said that he had
brought a number of his children there and had asked them
to bring all of their school friends or anyone else who
might be willing to do volunteer work for Senator KENNEDY.
There were a number of persons who had responded and who
had probably signed in at the KENNEDY headquarters, showing
a connection with either himself or the address he had
furnished and suggested his children use, which was
105544 Wilshire Boulevard, where his ex-wife and some of
his children now resided. He did not know the names of
these other individuals who may have come there
utilizing his name or address, but felt they were probably
of Iranian descent and that their names would undoubtedly
be recorded as volunteer workers. He added if the names
of these individuals of possible Iranian descent were
obtained, he and his half-sister may be able to aid in
identifying them. The members of his family who were known
to have been there were his daughter SHERIN, a high school
student, and his sons AMIR, PHILLIPE and SAHPOUR, the latter
age eleven, Another son, J. C, KHAN, was not a volunteer
worker at KENNEDY headquarters in Los Angeles.

Concerning the girl previously mentioned by Mr.
KHAN on June 10, 1968, who was thought possibly to have been
acquainted or seen close to SERHAN at the headquarters on
June 4, 1968, KHAN said he had been thinking about the dots
on her dress, which he had previously mentioned, and he had
seen a dress on the front of a current issue of "Vogue"
magazine, which showed the polka dot design, which he
exhibited and noted that the dots on the dress were about

- 630 -


--- Page 24 ---

LA 56-156

the size he observed on the dress worn by the girl in question,
which were approximately the size of a dime. He was unable to
furnish further description of this girl or the specific
coloring of the dress worn, beyond that it was two-toned and
the dots appeared to be dark blue or black on a light surface.

With respect to the man originally seen in the
blue Volkswagen, with the aforementioned girl in question,
as related by Mr. KHAN on June 10, 1968, he described this
man further as being a caucasian, thirty to thirty five years
of age, five feet eight inches to five feet eleven inches tall,
165 pounds, dark complexion, black hair and eyes, well
dressed, KHAN said he has been trying to refresh his
memory on this man seen in the Volkswagen, he previously
felt had seen before and could only say the man in the
Volkswagen somewhat resembled a person he previously had
seen in New York, who was a friend of LILLIE LAWRENCE, who
is an Iranian girl married to an American, and who had an
apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York. LILLIE was known
to have aided the Immigration and Naturalization Service
in the past, but was not believed to be directly employed
by them. Her husband, whose name he could not recall,
reportedly operated some Iranian "call girls" around New York.
KHAN said he could not confirm these rumors.

Photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN's brothers,
‘ SHARIF SIRHAN (photograph dated December 18, 1963) and
ADEL SIRHAN (photograph dated June 5, 1968) were exhibited
to Mr. KHAN who said he had no recollection of ever having
seen these two individuals, nor did he have any knowledge
otherwise of them.

Concerning his current occupation, Mr. KHAN said
he was not employed as such and that he owned a lot of
property in the past, some of which he had sold some time
ago and was living off the proceeds. He mentioned he still
owned property in Iran, which he had been unable to sell to
his satisfaction as the minute he sold it he felt that the
Iranian Government would tax him to the degree that it would
not be worthwhile, He mentioned that he is well known to
the Iranian colony in California and mentioned there were
approximately 5,000 Iranian students in school in California
colleges at the present time.

Mr. KHAN reiterated from his statements of
June 10, 1968, that he is well known to the Department of
Justice and State Department in Washington, D.C. ” He
said he had been interviewed by Agents of the FBI on a
number of occasions and mentioned that he had had some
contact with one of the New York Agents of the FBI whose
name he recalled was JOHN STOCKTON,

Mr. KHAN said that he was still Honorary Chairman
of the organization K,K, United Patroits for Justice,
Shahpour Avenue, Khoramshahr, Iran, since 1951, which had
been the basis for his registration, as related June 10,
1968, with the Registration Section of the Internal
Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

He mentioned he had no stock in this organization and was
only an honorary chairman,

The original issue of the "Nation", which Mr. KHAN
made available to Agents on June 10, 1968, was returned to
him on June 11, 1968, after copies had been made of the
article therein dealing with the activities of Mr. KHAN and
the U.S, Foreign Aid Program in Iran. Mr. KHAN stated he
had never been interviewed by Mr. FRED COOK nor had he met
anyone connected with the magazine, nor had he furnished
any material for the article. In his opinion, Mr. COOK
had obtained his material from court records and other
public government records. He mentioned that the Washington,
D.C. newspaper columnist, DREW FEARSON, had written
articles which involved KHAN and the allegations made by him
concerning the irregularities in the U.S. Foreign Aid Program
in Iran.

Mr. KHAN had recently seen Mr. WALTER SHERIDAN,
whom he had known in Washington, D.C, in 1963 when SHERIDAN
was in the U.S. Justice Department. SHERIDAN was in the
KENNEDY headquarters in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 2, 1968.

TA 56-156

He mentioned that Mr. SHHRIDNW was acquainted with Mr, KHAN's
background and activities in the Washington, D, C, area in the
past. KHAN further related that at the time he was protesting
irregularities in the Foreign Aid Program to Iran and claiming
that the poor poople of Iran were not getting the benefit of
the program, his position was undérstood and supported by the -
late President JOHN F, KENNEDY and on one occasion, with the
aid of Attorney General ROBERT F, KENNEDY had allowed KHAN

to use certain quotes from the Attorney General in support

of KHAN,

KHAN said that due to his opposition to the Shah
of Iran, he was naturally apprehensive that bodily injury
might come to him in a clandestine manner in the United
States and that he was always cautious, He said he felt that
in the past there had been leaks of information from certain
government agencies to the Iranian Embassy about KHAN's
activities in Washington, D.C. He said he had suspected
DREW PEARSON as being involved in these leaks. He said he
had learned that the Iranian Embassy knew that he had been
working on behalf of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY at the
campaign headquarters in Los Angeles during the recent
primary election.

Mr. KHAIBAR KHAN, 1215 Ocean Avenue, Apartment 201,
Santa Monica, California, telephone EX 3-0227, advised the
following:

With respect to the identity of the persons who
Mr, KHAN was responsible for their appearance as volunteer
workers at the Los Angeles Campaign Headquarters of Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY on June 1, 1968, and June 4, 1968, he
advised as follows:

The persons who actually worked there at his
request were his half-sister, MARYAM KOUSHAN, his son,
AMIR H. KHAN, a high school student, his daughter, SHIRIN
KHAN, a high school student, and his son, PHILLIPE KHAN,

a college student. Another son, J. C. KHAN, did not work
at the headquarters but did, on June 3, 1968, drive MARYAM
to the headquarters where she was doing volunteer work.

Mr. KHAN explained that he had brought the above
individuals with him at the time of interview and would have
them available for any questions the Agents desired to ask
them in his presence. Consequently, the above individuals
were interviewed and shown photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN and
his brothers, ADEL, MUNIR and SHARIF, the results of which
were reported separately.

On the late afternoon of June 4, 1968, Mr. KHAN
had furnished a list of names of individuals ts the KENNEDY -
Campaign Headquarters in Los Angeles who he said would be
available as volunteer workers in the November campaign
of Senator KENNEDY. The address of these various individuals
had been furnished as care of The Khaibar Khan, 105543
Wilshire Boulevard, telephone 475-1849, This is the address
of his divorced wife, TALAT KHAN, and his children. This
procedure was taken because the majority of these individuals
are not in the Los Angeles area and some of them are not
even in the United States but were expected to be here to
do volunteer work for Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY prior to
the November Election.

Of the persons whose names were furnished as
November volunteer workers for KENNEDY who live in the
Los Angeles area were as follows:

TALAT KHAN, mentioned above
Miss FARAH KHAN, a daughter
Miss ROSE KHAN, a daughter
M. DAJHM, a cousin

Mr. KHAN said that none of the persons whose
names were furnished on June 4, 1968, as November volunteer
workers had done any work at the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters
in Los Angeles during the June Primary Election.

It was pointed out by Mr. KHAN that he was a
leader of the opposition to the Shah of Iran among Iranian
nationals in the United States and that the persons that he
recommended as volunteer workers were of Iranian background
and that he did not desire to furnish their specific addresses
for security reasons.

He was afraid of possible politically motivated
reprisals against him and his associates due to the
opposition to the policies of the Shah.

Mr. KHAN said that he did not desire to get mixed
up in an affair involving the Arabian countries and the
Jewish State as a result of.the KENNEDY assassination,
however, in the interest of justice, he was willing to
cooperate with the FBI. Concerning any further thought he
may have had on the possibility of SIRHAN SIRHAN conspiring
with anyone in the shooting of Senator KENNEDY, he replied
the only possibility concerned the person, LILLIAN LAWRENCE,
whom he had referred to in his initial interview by the FBI
in the presence of his attorney in Los Angeles on June 10,
1968. He had just learned from sources he did not disclose
that LILLIAN LAWRENCE had recently been on a trip to the
Middle East, This, coupled with the previously
furnished information regarding the mention of the name

- 635 -


--- Page 29 ---

LA 56-156

of LILLY LAWRENCE by a man in the blue Volkswagen with a
young girl near KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters on June 3, 1968,
looked familiar to him. Further, that this young man,
unidentified, he felt quite sure he had seen before in

New York and possibly in association with LILLIAN LAWRENCE
and her husband. Further, that the young girl seen in the
Volkswagen had on the late evening of June 4, 1968, been
observed in the KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters standing very
near to the individual who he thought to be SIRHAN SIRHAN,
the details of which he had previously related. Also, that
this young girl, when last seen on June 4, 1968, was wearing
a dress, the upper portion of which, as best he could
observe, was light in color and contained dark, either

blue or black, dots on it.

He continued that though this was speculation,
it might be significant if there was any actual connection
between LILLIAN LAWRENCE, the Iranian national married to
an American in New York, the young man he observed with the
young girl in a blue Volkswagen outside the KENNEDY Head-
quarters and this same girl who was in the Volkswagen who
was, the following day, seen at the KENNEDY Headquarters
near the person thought to be SIRHAN SIRHAN.

Mr. KHAN reiterated that he did not actually see
the young girl in question talking to the person thought to
be SIRHAN at the headquarters but the two were standing face
to face about two feet apart, the man thought to be SIRHAN
near the water cooler and the girl by the coffee urn.

Mr. KHAN re-examined the photographs of SIRHAN
SIRHAN and his brothers, ADEL, MUNIR and SHARIF, including
a current photograph of the latter, and reached the conclusion
he had never seen any of the individuals previously with the
possible exception that he felt that he had seen SIRHAN SIRHAN
as related above.

It was mentioned by Mr. KHAN that if anything
ever developed from the information he furnished, he would

- 636 -


--- Page 30 ---

LA 56-156

not be willing to testify in a court of law with respect
to SIRHAN without personally observing SIRHAN. With
respect to the unknown girl in the Volkswagen, he would
also have to see any girl thought to be the same person
before he could make any more positive identfication.

Mr. KHAIBAR KHAN, who was previously interviewed
in this matter, phoned the Los Angeles Office of the FBI
July 5, 1968, and asked he be contacted by SA LESLIE F. WARREN
at telephone number 474-4561 extension 242.

Upon returning Mr. KHAN's call, he advised the
following:

Mr. KHAN said he wanted to report that he had been
arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
Los Angeles, on June 27, 1963, and was being held for #
deportation proceedings. He was in jail several days and
is currently out on $1,000 bail. A deportation hearing is
scheduled at INS, Los Angeles, July 19, 1963. DAVID CARLINER,
901 Warner Building, Washington D.C., was the attorney representing
Mr. KHAN in the proceedings.

Mr. KHAN said he had also been interviewed by two
detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on
June 27, 1968, as a potential witness in the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY. Mr. KHAN stated he furnished the information to the
police detectives about his working as a volunteer worker in
the Senator KENNEDY campaign headquarters of Los Angeles,
June 1 through June 4, 1968, and had thought he had seen SIRHAN
SIRHAN.at these headquarters on June 4, 1963, his opinion being
based on a photographic identification.

The LAPD, according to KHAN, wanted him to take a
lie detector test and also wanted to arrange for Mr. KHAN
to personally observe SIRHAN SIRHAN at the Los Angeles County
Jail in an attempt to confirm‘that he‘had seen
SIRHAN SIRHAN at the KENNEDY headquarters. Mr. KHAN declined
to take the test or go to the jail advising the police that
he wished to consult with his attorney before taking such
action.

Mrs. ELLENORE SEVERSON, also known as Mrs. Bertol
Charles Severson, housewife, 12409 Helena Street, Los Angeles,
telephone number GR 6-2909, related the following:

Mrs. SEVERSON said that she, a member of the
California State Central Committee of the Democratic Party,
had been active in the Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY Campaign
Headquarters at 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, during
the past two weeks. She served on the information désk at
the headquarters which was located opposite the front entrance.

On June 2, 1968, she noticed one of the volunteer
workers who showed up at the headquarters and who furnished
the name of KHATBAR KHAN, 105543 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
Angeles, appeared to be of Middle East descent. KHAN was in
and out of the headquarters until closing time on June 4, 1968.
It was noted that he, during this period at different intervals,
brought in a number of young persons of student or immediately
post-student age to do volunteer work at the headquarters. The
majority of them worked in the telephone department. All of
these persons brought in by Mr. KHAN appeared to be of Middle
East descent.

Mr. KHAN, in registering these various individual
volunteer workers had them furnish the address of 105544
Wilshire Boulevard. There must have been approximately 20
of these workers who Mr. KHAN brougnt in.

On Sunday, June 2, 1968, at about 2:00 p.m.,
Mrs. SEVERSON noticed a young man standing just inside the
entrance to the headquarters and Mr. KHAN was talking to
Mrs. SEVERSON at the information desk. One of the volunteer
workers, LARRY STRICK, asked the young man if he could help
him, whereupon the young man standing by the door reportedly
told LARRY STRICK that “I'm with him’ pointing towards

Mr. KHAN.

Mrs. SEVERSON said that she had seen pictures of
SIRHAN SIRHAN, who had been arrested for the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY and she was of the opinion that the young man ghe
had seen in the office near the front door on Sunday afternoon,
June 2, 1968, was in fact SIRHAN SIRHAN.

Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN which were taken by the
Los Angeles Police Department on June 5, 1968, were exhibited
to Mrs. SEVERSON who stated in her opinion that the photographs
exhibited to her very closely resembled the young man mentioned
above and in her opinion, "It was him". She did not recall
seeing this young man in question at any other time during her
work at the headquarters.

Mrs. SEVERSON suggested that LARRY STRICK, BILL
HENEBRY, a volunteer worker who spoke Arabic and appeared
to converse with Mr. KHAN at the headquarters, and Mrs.
MARGUERITE SWEENEY who was in charge of the headquarters,
be interviewed.

Mrs. SEVERSON said that the only other thing that
she could recall which might have a bearing on the matter was
that on June 2, 1968, she had an itinerary for Senator KENNEDY
for that date lying on her desk ,, Shortly after th
young man and Mr. KHAN were in her area, this itinerary was
missing and she never did recover it after making considerable
inquiry among other volunteer workers. This itinerary sheet
was a mimeograph form, was not issued to the public, there
were very few copies, and it was restricted to field personnel
at the headquarters. A new itinerary for Senator KENNEDY was
issued each day.

Mrs. SEVERSON described Mr. KHAN as being a male
Caucasian of Middle East descent, dark complexion, about
five feet eight inches to five feet nine inches, stocky build,
age in 40s or early 50s. He had dark hair, slightly graying,
which he combed straight back. His nose was slightly semitic
and of medium size, slightly aquiline. He was muscular, had
an athletic build, and claimed to have had a large group of
sport supply stores and specialized in golfing. He had a splint
on one arm which he claimed to have broken during a fall playing

tennis. He spoke with a heavy accent although claimed to have
studied English in England. He reportedly had been born in
Istanbul and was an Iranian by birth. He claimed to have

a daughter going to high school in the United States and to
have come out from New York City to aid Senator KENNEDY's.
campaign in the Los Angeles area.

Mrs. SEVERSON recalled that in one instance, a young
girl approximately 23 years of age, dark hair, fair complexion,
attractive, well built, of apparent Middle East extraction,
appeared with Mr. KHAN at the headquarters. She was dressed in
a stylish manner and was on crutches. One leg was held up
although not in a cast or splint. When this young girl and
Mr. KHAN appeared, on exact date not recalled, the young girl
signed a name and address at which point Mr. KHAN stated,
"Don't use that address. Use the 105544 Wilshire Boulevard
address". The original address was crossed out and the latter
address submitted. Mrs. SEVERSON said that Mr. KHAN had on
occasion been bringing the young volunteer workers to the
information desk to register and had asked Mrs. SEVERSON to
print the names for him as he was unable to write. She
recalled that all of the names were of names usually
associated with people who live in the Middle East section
of the world.

Later Mrs. SEVERSON telephoned the Los Angeles Office
of the FBI and stated that she had,on this date at 12:27 p.m.,
been watching CBS news over KNXT, Channel 2, Los Angeles, on
television and during a pan shot of the crowd at the Los Angeles
International Airport at the time Senator KENNEDY's body was
being taken to New York, she observed in this television shot
a man wearing a white shirtge believed to have been one of the
persons who Mr. KHAN had brought into the Senator KENNEDY

MARYAM K@USHAN, also known as Rose Khan, 1215 9cean
Avenue, Apartment 206, Santa Monica, California, phone EX 3-0227,
was interviewed in the presence of her half brother, KHATBAR
KHAN who resides in Apartment 201 at this same address, She
related the following:

‘ She was aware that dgents had talked to KHAIBAR
June 10, 1968, regarding any knowledge he may have had of
SIRHAN SIRHAN who was charged with shooting Senator R6BERT F,
KENNEDY. SIRHAN reportedly having been seen in the Los Angeles
Kennedy Campaign Headquarters, 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, where
both she and KHAIBAR had been volunteer workers from June 1,
1968 through June 4, 1968.

Photographs of SIRHAN taken by the Los Angeles Police
Department June 5, 1968, wawe.shown to her. She claimed, based
on the photograph description, she felt she had seen SIRHAN
just outside the campaign headquarters June 2, 1968, between
2:00 and 2:30 p.m. KHALBAR had let her out of the automobile
in front of the headquarters. She was using crutches, due to
having been thrown off a horse while riding in Griffith Park,
Los Angeles recently, and the person thought to be SIRHAN held
the door for her while she went inside. He, as she recalled, wore
a shirt opened at the collar, a dark wind-breaker type jacket
with a collar and a zipper, and white tennis sneakers. Color
of pants not recalled. He otherwise looked very much like the
photographs.

About two hours later on June 2, 1968, she saw the
person thought to be SIRHAN, when she was just outside the
women's room door inside the headquarters and he appeared to
be heading toward the door which leads to a side entrance of
the headquarters. She did not see this person with anyone
or talking with anyone during the time she observed him.

She had no recollection of ever seeing this person before and
did not know who he may have been. When she later saw pictures
of SIRHAN in the press and on television she thought she may
have seen SIRHAN at the headquarters as related.

KHAIBAR KAHN on June 2, 1968, came into the headquarters
around 3:00 p.m. She had learned from KHAIBAR that he had
thought he had seen STRHAN in the headquarters on election day,
June 4, 1968, around 5:00 to 5:30 p.m. She was in the headquarters
at that time on that date but had no recollection of seeing the
person thought to be SIRHAN at that time. She also said she
did not recall seeing any girl in the headquarters at any time
wearing a polka dot dress.

KOUSHAN said there was a movie crew in the headquarters
late in the afternoon of June 4, 1968, around 5:00 to 6:00 p.m.,
reportedly a Swiss group who were to do a film on American
Political Campaigns. They were taking film shots of the whole
"area. Mrs. MARGARET SWEENEY who was in charge of the headquarters
office could possibly identify this group.

Several of Mr. KHAN's children were in the campaign
headquarters in Los Angeles as volunteer workers and were told
by Mr. KHAN to bring friends to help out. Their friends would
in all probability have been of Iranian descent as is Mr.
KHAN's family. A daughter, SHIRIN and a son AMIR, who are
both of high school age, a son SAHPOUR, age 11, were there on
June 3, 1968, and another son PHILLIPE, employed by the Culver
Theatre in Culver City was’ there on June 4, 1968. They and
their friends were thought to have registered as having some
connection with Mr. KHAN or from the residence of the KHAN
children and his divorced wife at 105543 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles. Mr. KHAN is prominent in the Iranian colony in
Southern California and has been openly opposed to certain
policies of the Shah in Iran with respect to handling of U.S.
Foreign Aid Program in Iran. In fact he could be considered a
leader of the opposition to the Shah. Both JOHN F, KENNEDY and
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY had been sympathetic to Mr. KHAN's
program to aid the poor people in Iran receive fuller benefit
of the U.S. Foreign Aid in, that country. Hence, the political
support of Mr. KHAN had7éiven both of the KENNEDYs. In the

opinion of KOUSHAN, about 90% of the 5,000 students from Tran
now in colleges in California, were opposed to the policies
of the Shah with respect to the foreign aid program.

Photographs of two brothers of SIRHAN, SHARIF BISARA
SIRHAN, taken December 18, 1963, and of ADEL SIRHAN, taken June
5, 1968, were exhibited to -KOUSHAN ‘who had no recognition as
far as ADEL's photo was concerned. She thought the photo although
taken in 1963, of SHARIF. somewhat resembled a young man who
was among the volunteer drivers who were in the Senator KENNEDY
Campaign Headquarters on June 4, 1968, around 3:00 p.m. Mrs.
BERNARDINI (phonetic) and a man named BILL who handled the
volunteer drivers could possibly resolve whether or not this
person could have been SHARIF SIRHAN,.

KOUSHAN.: related her recollection of a young man who
she and Mr. KHAN had given a lift in their automobile on the
evening of June 4, 1968, at about 8:00 p.m. She was sitting
in the car near the campaign headquarters waiting for Mr.

KHAN, when this young man, white, age about 22-23 years, 51g"
to 5'9", skinny build, reddish face, dark longish hair,
carrying some rolled up campaign posters, came up to the car
and asked if she were going to the Ambassador Hotel. When
informed she was not but was heading to West Los Angeles area,
he asked for a lift in that direction. She did not know this
young man but he appeared to be a campaign worker so she agreed
and he got in the back seat of the car. When Mr. KHAN came

to the car the young man's presence was explained. This young
man then wanted Mr. KHAN to give him a KENNEDY button he was
wearing to enable the young man to get into the Senator KENNEDY
Campaign Party at the Ambassador later that evening. When

Mr. KHAN declined, he wanted Mr. KHAN to go back to the
campaign headquarters and get him a button, press pass or some-
thing which would enable him to get into the KENNEDY party at
the Ambassador, Mr, KHAN also declined this request in spite
of a persistant attitude. The young man claimed to have been
born in Manchester, England, of British parents and said his
father was a salesman. He did not talk with a British accent.
He furnished his name on a piece of paper as, MICHAEL WAYNE,
1430 South Hi Point Street, No. 105, Los Angeles, California
90035. He was let out of the car on Wilshire Boulevard, just

MARYAM had previously advised that she had
observed a person, who, based on a photographic identification,
was SIRHAN SIRHAN. She had observed this individual when
entering the Los Angeles Campaign Headquarters of Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY, 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,

had stated that the photograph of this brother closely
resembled an individual she had seen at the KENNEDY Campaign
Headquarters around 3:00 PM on June 4, 1968. This person
had been one of the volunteer drivers,

MARYAM was shown a current photograph of SHARIF
SIRHAN. She voiced the opinion that the current photograph
also stongly resembled the person she had seen in the
KENNEDY Headquarters as a volunteer driver.

MARYAM also further examined a photograph of
SIRHAN SIRHAN and said she still had the same opinion as

as a volunteer worker. This is the English spelling of her
name, however, she is sometimes referred to under the American
spelling of her name MIRIAM KUSHAN. She also said that
approximately six months ago when she was thrown from a
horse while riding in Griffith Park in Los Angeles and had
been taken to the Los Angeles General Hospital by KHAIBAR
KHAN with whom she was riding, she had been booked in the
hospital under the name of ROSE KHAN. This had been done
in view of the fact that she and Mr. KHAN are Iranian
nationals and Mr. KHAN was the leader of the opposition to
the Shah of Iran among Iranians in the United States. It
was a security measure as Mr. KHAN was apprehensive of
political and possibly physical reprisals as a result of
his opposition to the Shah of Iran.

LAURENCE DAVID STRICK, also known as Larry Strick,
11930 Iredell Street, Studio City, California, telephone
number TR 7-6151, a student at Hollywood High School in
Los Angeles advised as follows:

Mr. STRICK said that for several days before the
California Primary Elections on June 4, 1968, he had been a
volunteer worker at Senator KENNEDY's Campaign Headquarters
at 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles. He said that he had
seen a young man at the KENNEDY Headquarters who he possibly
believed to be SIRHAN SIRHAN who had been arrested for shooting
Senator KENNEDY. He claimed that he had seen this young man
on June 2, 1968, at about 2:00 p.m. and that this person had come
into the headquarters and was standing by the front door at the
same time a Mr. KHATBAR KHAN, who had been doing some voluntary
work at the KENNEDY Headquarters, was standing at the information
desk which is located near the front door at the headquarters.
Mr. KHAN had been bringing in a number of young people as
volunteer workers, all of whom appeared to be descendants of
people who resided in the Arabian countries of the Middle
Hast. Mr. KHAN, himself, appeared that he may have been from
the Middle East and reportedly was from Iran.

Mr. STRICK continued that he had asked the young
man in question who was standing by the door on June 2, 1968 if
he, STRICK, could help him, whereupon the young man replied,
"No thank you. I'm with him" and pointed towards Mr. KHAN.

Mr. STRICK said that this young man was poéssibly around
headquarters that afternoon pyt that this was the only time
that he could recall seeing him.

Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN taken by the Los Angeles
Police Department on June 5, 1968 were exhibited to Mr. STRICK
who voiced the opinion they were photographs of the person who
he believed to be identical to the aforementioned young man
who was in the KENNEDY headquarters on June 2, 1968 at

Mr. STRICK said that he had, since the shooting of
Senator KENNEDY, discussed the possibility of SIRHAN SIRHAN
having been in the KENNEDY Headquarters, with Mrs. ELLENORE
SEVERSON who had been on the information desk at the headquarters
at the time and they both had been of the opinion that there
was a strong possibility that SIRHAN SIRHAN had been in the
headquarters and that he might possibly be known to Mr. KHAN.

STRICK said that Mr. KHAN appeared to be a man 50
years of age, five feet ten inches in height, stocky build,
dark. hair, fairly dark complexion, large forehead, wore
"snappy clothes" and had a plaster cast on one arm.

Mr. STRICK noted that a young girl on crutches
had been in the company of Mr. KHAN on one or two occasions
between June 2, 1968, and June 4, 1968, at the KENNEDY
Headquarters. She had no cast on her leg which appeared to
‘be normal in appearance and on one occasion she came in alone.
It was noted that she was driving a blue car of the Camaro
type which had a large KENNEDY sticker on the side. She
appeared to be in her early 20s, five feet three inches in
neight, fair complexion, dark hair, slight build.

Mr. STRICK related that he had learned from
Mrs. SEVERSON that an itinerary sheet for Senator KENNEDY
for June 2, 1968 had turned up missing. There was suspicion
that maybe Mr. KHAN had taken it as he was known to have been
standing near her desk just before it had been missed.

Mr. STRICK said that all of the voluntary workers
brought in by Mr. KHAN reportedly furnished the same address
as Mr. KHAN but he could not identify them.” He was of the
opinion that their names would be on the registrations of
volunteer workers in the KENNEDY Headquarters.

Mr. STRICK examined a photograph of SHARIF BISHARA
STRHAN, taken December 18, 1963, and of ADEL SIRHAN, taken
June 5, 1968, both brothers of SIRHAN SIRHAN. Mr. STRICK said
he had no knowledge of seeing anyone resembling either of these

brothers around the Senator KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters or
elsewhere.
