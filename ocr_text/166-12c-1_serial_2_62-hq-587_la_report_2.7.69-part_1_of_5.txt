attorney, RUSSELL E PARSONS,

GRANT B, COOPER made a motion to the court that he, COOPER,
be included as an attorney of record to represent SIRHAN.

COOPER requested, and was granted, a further
postponement of the case until January 7, 1969, for trial
date. COOPER requested this continuance on the basis that
he had been involved in United States District Court at
Los Angeles on behalf of a defendant in a lengthy Federal
trial. An additional reason given for the request of
continuance was that New York Attorney EMILE ZOLA BERMAN
is also to assist in the defense of SIRHAN and his previous
commitments precluded his appearance in Los Angeles before
January 7, 1969. —

Judge HERBERT V, WALKER, who is the presiding
judge for this trial, advised on December 5, 1968, that
he is making arrangements for closed circuit television
coverage Of the trial as the courtroom will not accomodate
the number of news representatives who have made application
to attend the trial.

Judge WALKER further advised‘that it is his intention
. to sequester the jury once it has been sworn and this condition
will remain until the termination of the trial.

‘ On December 18, 1968, SIRHAN appeared in court
before Judge WALKER for the purpose of including New York
Attorney EMILE ZOLA BERMAN as an additional attorney to
represent SIRHAN.

During this same appearance, Los Angeles County
Deputy District Attorney JOHN “HOWARD requested the court
to hear,and stated,his objections to sequestering the jury.

favor of a sequestered jury. Judge WALKER ruled that the
jury would be sequestered during the entire trial.

Office immediately complied with the court order. These
items included various statements, photographs, and drawings

ground rules for trial procedures when the trial starts
on January 7, 1969. : ; : :

; At that time, GRANT B, COOPER attempted to make
a motion to have separate juries; one to determine guilt
or innocence, and one to determine penalty.

COOPER also attempted to make a motion to vacate
the Grand Jury's indictment against SIRHAN on the basis
that the-Grand Jury, as it currently exists, is improperly .
paneled, Judge WALKER refused to hear the motion on that
date and indicated that they would be heard prior to the
selection of a jury. .

in.Los Angeles County Superior Court and Defense Attorneys
offered motions, Court was recessed until January 8, 1959,

He was personally acquainted with the late JOHN
KENNEDY and ROBERT KENNEDY and the KENNEDY family.

On April 1, 1968, he went to California, at the
request of ROBERT KENNEDY , to head up the Southern California .
Delegation and was in California until ROBERT KENNEDY was
fatally shot on June 5, 1968.

On the evening of June 4, 1968, he was in ROBERT
KENNEDY's personal headquarterson the Fifth floor of the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, watching election
returns on television, with the personal staff and upper
echelon of ROBERT KENNEDY. At about 11:20 PM the news pro-
jection showed that ROBERT KENNEDY was going to be the winner.
ROBERT KENNEDY thought it was time to go down and meet the
crowd below.

After making arrangements with Mr. UNO the hotel
manager, and two or three other people,as to the routine to
follow to get ROBERT KENNEDY downstairs to the Podium he led
ROBERT KENNEDY downstairs to the Podium. AS far as he can
recali they took an elevator to the basement of thie hotel,
walked through a passage way to a freight elevator and up *the
freight elevator to the floor wherethe baliroom and Podium
were located. As far as he can recall they entered the
serving kitchen from the freight elevator, walked by the
serving table and ice machine on up to the Podium. In the
area of the serving kitchen ROBERT KENNEDY shook hands with
a few of the hotel employees. ,

At the time there was a crowd of people behind
and up on the Podium. The ballroom was crowded with people.

After leading ROBERT KENNEDY up to the Podium he
told ROBERT KENNEDY that he was going to clear a path so
that when he (KENNEDY) left the Podium he could go to a
ballroom on a floor below where there was a crowd of people.
He told ROBERT KENNEDY to go to the left when he left the
Podium and KENNEDY agreed to this.

He started clearing a path from the Podiwn on the
lett side of the Podium. ROBERT KENNEDY left the Podium and
he lost sight of him in the mass of people. He was puzzled
because he expected ROBERT KENNEDY to turn in his direction.
He stayed where he was because he thought ROBERT KENNEDY
might be chatting with someone. He continued to try to keep
& path open for ROBERT KENNEDY. :

Several minutes went by. People were talking in
loud voices and celebrating . He was about thirty feet to
the left of the Podium, The crowd started surging back
toward him from the direction of the Podium. He heard women
screaming and he thought someone had gotten knocked down in
the crowd. He then noticed people rumning around in a daze
and women weeping. : a,

He then heard that someone had been shot. STEVE
SMITH came out to the ballroom to try to clear the ballroom.
He went back to the area where ROBERT KENNEDY had been shot.
ROBERT KENNEDY had already been removed from the hotel and
SIRHAN SIRHAN had already been removed from the hotel by the
police. :

He had no knowledge of SIRHAN being in the hotel
prior to the shooting of ROBERT KENNEDY.

He did not hear any shots and did not realize that
ROBERT KENNEDY had been shot until several minutes after the
shooting. At the time of the shooting his wife was up in
the Fifth floor personal headquarters of ROBERT KENNEDY
watching television.

WY 44-1640

Just prior to STEVE SMITH coming out to try to
clear the ballroom he noticed an individual from the rear
running toward the anteroom. This individual would have been
between the Podium and the anteroom. He only observed this
individual for a moment. This individual had a close shaven
head, dark skin, age about thirty to forty, stocky build and
appeared to be a mulatto. He did not see this man's face
and would be unable to identify him. At the time he thought
to himself that this individual was probably a photographer
rushing out to get his film developed. He also recalls
Slightly that there may have been another man running in front
of this individual but he cannot describe this second man at
all.

the impression that he was going to leave by the area in
which BENSON was standing, He did not but left through the
rear of the stage. BENSON wads then in an alcove near the
ballroom and out of sight of Senator KENNEDY when he heard
a girl scream something such as “He's been shot." Instantly
there was bedlam. BENSON headed toward the area of Senator
KENNEDY and on the way met STEVE SMITH, Senator KENNEDY'S
brother-in-law,

When BENSON got to the room of the shooting, he
Saw Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor. His lips were
moving but BENSON heard nothing. BENSON stayed there,
taking pictures, until Senator KENNEDY was removed. :

BENSON did not see the shooting and to his :
knowledge did not then and never has seen SIRHAN SIRHAN.

BENSON then went outside the ballroom where there
was a white, male, about 42 years old, approximately 6° 2".
rather fatiwith a United States flag in his mouth. BENSON
stated that this individual was a “real nutty guy" who said
something such as "Thank God, he’s been shot," At this
time BENSON was talking to JOHN PELGER and GEORGE GALE,
reporters for the London Daily Mirror, who did not get into
the kitchen and they observed this "real nut."

observed the shooting of Senator KENNEDY or any of the immediate
aftermath in the vicinity of the shooting. Mr, KRAFT first

the lobby from the Embassy Room. His attention was particularly
drawn to a young man who was running and who hurdled a couch,
