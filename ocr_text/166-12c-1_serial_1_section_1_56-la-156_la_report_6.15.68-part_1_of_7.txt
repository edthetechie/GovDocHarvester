for 22 years.

She stated that she received a call apparently from
the switchboard operator of the Ambassador Hotel, on June
5, 1968, at approximately 12:18 am, requesting an ambulance.
She asked the person to whom she was talking the nature of
the trouble. The person told her she did not know, but that
she was told to call an ambulance. CASE asked her if it was
someone sick, or if there had been an accident. The person
told her she thought someone was injured, and "please hurry”.
CASE advised at this point, she could hear much excitement
in the background and she asked the person where the ambulance
was needed, and the person told her the Embassy Room, CASE
advised that she would estimate this conversation lasted 20
to 30 seconds. She advised that she immediately dispatched
ambulance unit G18, to the Ambassador, and then immediately
notified the Los Angeles Police Department switchboard. She
advised that the police switchboard operator wanted to know
what had happened.

She advised that the ambulance which she dispatched
to the Ambassador Hotel, arrived there at 12:20 am, or 12:25 am.
She could not remember which. She advised that this ambulance
arrived back at the Central Receiving Hospital at approximately

any of the times which these units were sent to the hotel, but
stated the times were logged in the records of the Central
Receiving Hospital.

She advised that from the tie the ambulance arrived
with Senator KENNEDY at the hospital, she was extremely busy
handling incoming calls and a few other routine requests for
ambulances. She advised that she received many, many, calls
from pergons wanting to know the condition of Senator KENNEDY.
She advised them.that hig condition was critical, which ended
the conversation. She stated that no one told her the condi-
tion of Senator KENNEDY, but she assumed that it was critical,
and this was the easiest way to handle the inquiries coming
in from the general public. She stated that she did not think
that any of the calls she received were out of the ordinary.
She thought that all of them were from persons who were just
generally concerned about Senator KENNEDY. She did not recall
any calls out of the ordinary.

ROBERT HULSMAN, ambulance driver, Central Receiving
Hospital, Los Angeles, California, was interviewed at his
residence 18621 Mescalero, and furnished the following
information:

On the morning of June 5, 1968, he was on duty
at Central Receiving Hospital and received orders to proceed
to the Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California. The order was received at 12:17 a.m. and simply
stated, “injury, Ambassador Hotel ~ proceed".

He, accompanied by attendant MAX BEHRMANW, left
Central Receiving Hospital at 12:18 a.m. and proceeded to the
Ambassador Hotel, arriving there at 12:23 a.m,
i)

Upon arrival at the Ambassador Hotel, he drove up
to the main entrance and was met by several KENNEDY campaign
members, who directed mim and BEHRMANNto the scene of the
shooting. They initially started up a staircase, but found
an elevator, which was available. As they were going up
in the elevator, he turned to a man standing near them and
asked who was hurt. The man replied, "Senator KENNEDY has
been shot", ,

When the elevator opened he immediately recognized
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY lying on his back directly in front
of the elevator. Next to him was a second man, who he later
learned was PAUL SCHRADE, also on his back in a large pool
of blood. He assumed this man was dead and went directly to
Senator KENNEDY. There was a large terrycloth towel near
KENNEDY's head, which was completely saturated with blood.
Also, the hair on the right side of the head was badly messed
up so that there was no question but that he had been injured
in the head. Mrs. KENNEDY was kneeling next to her husband
and applying an ice-pack to his head.

At this point, KENNEDY was conscious and HULSMAN
spoke to him telling him he would be all right and they were
taking him to the hospital. The stretcher was placed next
to KENNEDY's body and he went to the legs while BEHRMAMWwent to
the head. He placed a hand under KENNEDY's buttocks and
another under the calves of his legs so he could lift him onto
the stretcher. At this point, KENNEDY said "Don't, please
don't move me."

After placing KENNEDY on the stretcher, he was
wheeled a few feet to the elevator so he could be taken to
the ambulance. During this time, Mrs KENNEDY had been
asking where they were taking Senator KENNEDY and attempting
to prevent them from moving him.

Once in the elevator, they descended by accident
to the basement. The elevator operator then took them to the
first floor, where they began to wheel KENNEDY out to the
ambulance. During this time, KENNEDY's legs had been moving
and HULSMAN had been watching closely so he did not roll
from the stretcher. As they were going to the ambulance,
Mrs. KENNEDY was yelling and asking where they were taking
her husband. HULSMAN again told her they were taking him
to Central Receiving Hospital. At this point, Mrs. KENNEDY
placed her arm around his neck and tried to stop him from
pushing the stretcher. He took her arm from his neck and
said, "Come on. We're going to the hospital."

Upon reaching the ambulance, they placed the
stretcher with KENNEDY in the ambulance and locked it down.
Everyone tried to get into the ambulance; however, only
MAX BEHRMAN Mrs. KENNEDY and one other unidentified white
male were allowed in the rear. After shutting the rear door,
he went to the driver's seat. At this point, someone
apparently in an effort to get into the rear of the ambulance,
opened the rear doors and he had to return to make sure they
were securely locked. He again returned and got into the cab
of the ambulance. In the cab was a man known to him as BILL
BARRY and two other unknown white males.

TA 56-156

As they pulled away from the Ambassador Hotel, a
Los Angeles Police Department patrol car moved in to escort
the ambulance and they began the drive back to Central
Receiving Hospital. En route, he could hear Mrs. KENNEDY
arguing with MAX BEHRMANN. HULSMAN stated he does not know
exactly what provoked tnese heated words, but he believes
it had something to do with BEHRMANW asking Mrs. KENNEDY for
identification. As they were proceeding to Central Receiving
Hospital, BILL BARRY turned in the cab and attempted to crawl
through the opening into the ambulance portion of the vehicle
and it was necessary for HULSMAN to restrain him. At this
point, BARRY said, "Don't let the son of a bitch touch him.",
referring to BEHRMANWs efforts to aid KENNEDY.

Upon arrival at Central Receiving Hospital, he
was met by the hospital staff and removed KENNEDY from the
ambulance to the interior of the hospital.

As the stretcher was being wheeled into the
hospital, an unknown photographer reached out and grasped
the stretcher with one hand, holding his camera in the other,
in an effort to get a close-up of Senator Kennedy. At this
point, Mrs. KENNEDY screamed to the man to leave the stretcher
alone and BILL BARRY reached across and struck the man with
sufficient force to make him release the stretcher.

After unloading Senator KENNEDY, HULSMAN was ordered
to return to the Ambassador Hotel, again accompanied by BEHRMANN,
where they picked up PAUL SCHRADE and returned to Central
Receiving Hospital. SCHRADE was accompanied by a Negro
doctor by the name of MC BRUM (phonetic).

Mr. ROBERT JEAN GINDROZ, Executive Chef, Ambassador
Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, was
interviewed in his office, which is adjacent to the main
kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, during the morning of June 5,
1968, by SAs THEODORE J. A'HEARN and GILBERT G. BENJAMIN
in the presence of FBI Photo Lab employee RICHARD D. FERNANDES.

Mr. GINDROZ was advised of the identities of the
above personnel and that the interview was in connection with
the shooting of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. He indicated.
that officers of the Los Angeles Police Department had
already talked briefly with him about the case.

Mr. GINDROZ stated that he presantly resides at
2921 Briarknoll, Los Angeles, California (zip code 90046).
His home telephone is 654-7180. He is a native of Switzerland;
having been born January 5, 1932, in Montana, Switzerland.
He is: not yet a naturalized United States citizen, but hopes
to become an American citizen. He has been in the United States
of America for the past eleven years.

In his present position as Executive Chef of the
Ambassador Hotel, he has overall charge of the procurement,
preparation and service of all food in the Ambassador Hotel
dining rooms,

He is married. His wife, Mrs. MARY THERESA GINDROZ,
is presently a patient in Kaiser Hospital, Hollywood, ;
California, where she is to undergo surgery. SHe entered the
hoppital on June 4, 1968.

Mr. GINDROZ owns a 1959 Chrysler sedan, with current
California license plates JPT 343. He also owns a sports car,
a small Sunbeam Arrow (which his wife normally drives). He
said his Chrysler has over 115,000 miles on it and he is just
driving it until he can take delivery on a new car. He said
the Chrysler has an ignition switch which can be started by
just inserting any key, or in fact for that matter even by
inserting some stiff metallic object, such as a screw driver,

____ and turning the switch.

Mr. GINDROZ stated that he lost his original set of
keys to the Chrysler about two and a half years ago, somewhere
in the Los Angeles area. He lost his wallet and credit cards
at the same time. The keys that he now has, he uses only to
lock the trunk, noting again that any key will turn on the
ignition switch and thus start the car. He said that he does
not lock the doors.

He stated that he was having some trouble with the
ear on June 4, 1968, and so decided to drive it into the
Standard Service Station on the southeast corner of Alexandria

_and Sixth Streets, Los Angeles, California, where he
regularly trades. He said the telephone number at the
station is DU 7-2005. He did drive it in on the morning of
June 4th and left it at the above Standard Service Station
to have them check it over and see what was wrong with it.
He thought that it might be battery or generator trouble.

His wife drove the Sunbeam Arrow in and he took her
to Kaiser Hospital and drove her car back to the hotel so that
he wevuld have it to go home in at the end of the day, if his
Chrysler was not in working condition and had to stay in the
shop. He said that about 1:00 p.m., on June 4, 1968, he
learned telephonically from the Standard Service Station
that his generator was shot and that it would be quite
expensive to replace it. He decided not to repair it.

A young Swiss friend of his, Mr. DANIEL GAMBERONI,
who resides at 22397 Enada Way in the San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles, (residence telephone 887-0954), attends
Woodbury College on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles,
dropped into the hotel kitchen after his Tuesday classes on
June 4, 1968, to see if Chef GINDROZ had any extra work as he
needed to make some extra money as he was planning to go back
to Switzerland for a vacation in August’ 1968. He said
Mr. GAMBERONI is married to a woman from a wealthy Mexican
family, whose parents continue to live in Mexico. He has
two children. He belongs to a college fraternity at Woodbury
College.

When GAMBERONI came into the Ambassador on June 4,
1968, he said he had nothing to do from then (which was about

3:30 p.m.) until 6:00 p.m., so Mr, GINDROZ asked him if he
would go over to the Standard Service Station on Sixth Street
to pick up his Chrysler before the station closed for the
evening. He said he told GAMBERONI not to bring the car back
into the Ambassador parking lot, but to park it on the street
ag near to the hotel as possible. He said that he did not
want i% parked in the Ambassador lot because he recalled that
once before when Senator KENNEDY was staying at the hotel,
Mr. GINDROZ had his car blocked in the parking lot for more
than thirty minutes when he was ready to to home after work,

He said he gave GAMBERONI his Standard credit card
to present at the gas station for payment of the charges to
have the battery recharged.

About thirty minutes after GAMBERONI left the
Ambassador kitchen, he returned and brought Mr. GINDROZ back
his key ring with the three keys that had been left with
the car, when he dropped it off at the Standard Station
earlier. Mr. GAMBERONI told him that he had parked the car
on the west side of Alexandria, facing Wilshire and the
hotel, between Wilshire and Sixth Street. GINDROZ said that
he had not moved the car since that time, as he had not
left the hotel between that time and the present interview
with him.

Chef GINDROZ said he had known DANIEL GAMBERONI
almost from the time of the latter's birth. He was born of
Italian parents. His older brother was Mr. GINDROZ's best
friend in Switzerland. GAMBERONI and his older brother both
went to the same school in Montreux, Switzerland, that
GINDROZ did. They grew up together in that town. He said
that from about November 1967 to December 13, 1967, GAMBERONI
worked steadily in the Ambassador kitchen staff, while he was
going to Cambria Adult School. Then in mid-December he vent
to Mexico for about a month to five or six weeks to visit his
wife's family and friends. He then returned to the Los Angeles
area and entered Woodbury College. He said their friendship
was such that it was never necessary for GAMBERONI to have had
to submit a formal application for employment at the Ambassador
Hotel. Mr. GINDROZ said, "I just put him,to work." GAMBERCNI
came to the Southern California area from Switzerland in June 1968.

Chef GINDROZ viewed two photographs of the individual
identified as SIRHAN SIRHAN and stated that he does not
recognize him as anyone that he had seen before, and certainly
not of any former or present kitchen emplayees of the
Ambassador Hotel. He said that he thought the individual
appeared to be of Mexican-American ancestry and somewhat
resembled a friend of his employed as a chef at the Gate of
Spain restaurant in Santa Monica.

Mr. GINDROZ said that he could not account for a
key to his Chrysler sedan being in the possession of SIRHAN.
He said that if it was merely a Key that would start his car,
then it could have been any key because as he pointed out
previously any key or even a screw driver could be used to
turn the ignition switch on, and thus start the car.

Chef GINDROZ said that he personally did not see any
of the shooting but two of the kitchen employees reportedly
were quite close to the scene. One was ANGELO DE PIERRO,
son of the Ambassador Hotel Banquet Manager, and the other
was NIVA JOSHIO, who was making sandwiches near the place
where Senator KENNEDY fell. JOSHIO resides at 2877 Edgehill
Drive, Los Angeles (zip code 90018). His Social Security
Number is | His home telephone number is either PIl
RE 24-7036 or RE 4-2036 (Mr. GINDROZ said he was not sure of

the entry in his personal telephone pook concerning this
latter number).

Mr. GINDROZ said that he personally works long hours
in his job as Executive Chef, and that his having been at
work from 9:00 a.m. on June h, 1968, until past midnight was
not unusual.

WILLIAM F. GARDNER, Director of Security, Ambassador
Hotel, Los Angeles, California, was questioned concerning the
possibility of a change in Senator KENNEDY's plans immediately

possibility existed that Senator KENNEDY had originally planmwed
to proceed immediately after his victory speech to the
Ambassador Ballroom, however, altered.this plan and proceeded
in the direction of the Colonial Room.

Mr. GARDNER stated that he had received no official
notice of what Senator KENNEDY's plans or itinerary were on that
evening; however, it was his understanding that following his
victory speech in the Enbassy Room, the Senator would proceed
to the Colonial Room where he would greet members of the press.
He stated that he recalled that near the conclusion of Senator
KENNEDY's speech and while he was stationed in the rear hallway
behind the Embassy Room podium, a female member of the KENNEDY
campaign staff informed him that the Senator intended to leave
by the réar steps of the hotel, and she asked him to insure
that a pathway could be made for the Senator's exit. He stated
he immediately contacted the front doorman and determined that
KENNEDY's limousine and police escort had been moved to the rear
of the Embassy Room. He stated that in view of these instructions,
he merely assumed that Senator KENNEDY would no longer greet the
press in the Colonial Room

ARTHUR MADDOX, 744 South Catalina, Los Angeles,
California, advised that he has been employed as a security
guard at the Ambassador Hotel for approximately six years.

On the night of Senator KENNEDY's victory speech at the Embassy
Room, MADDOX advised that he was assigned a position controlling
the main entrance to the Colonial Room. MADDOX stated he
assumed this position approximately 45 minutes prior to the
Senator's arrival at the Bubassy Room. The Colonial Room,
according to MADDOX, was set up as a press room where election
returns were being received, and it was his understanding that
following the completion of his victory speech, Senator KENNEDY
was to visit the Colonial Room for the purpose of greeting
members of the press and thanking them for their cooperation.
It was MADDOX's opinion that the Senator and his party were
proceeding to the Colonial Room through the pantry area of the
Embassy kitchen when he was shot. To his knowledge, there had
been no change in plans from the original information he
possessed that the Senator was to Leave the Embassy Room to go
to the Colonial Room.

Mr. MADDOX stated that he has seen photographs of
SIRHAN B. SIRHAN and he does not recall having seen him at the
hotel prior to the shooting.

FRED A. MURPHY, generally known as Pat Murphy,
advised he resides at 111 South Oxford Avenue, Los Angeles,
telephone number D.U. 3-3653. Mr. MURPHY stated that he
was a retired Los Angeles Police Department Lieutenant
and is employed as a security officer at the Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles.

Mr. MURPHY stated that on the night of June 4, 1968,
he was stationed in the general area of the pantry, behind
the Colonial and Embassy Rooms of the notel, during Senator
KENNEDY's victory speech. Mr. MURPHY stated that prior
to the KENNEDY speech, he learned from an unknown female
member of the KENNEDY staff, he believes in the presence
of Security Officer WILLIAM GARDNER, that the Senator, following
his speech, would exit to the rear of the Embassy Room,
proceed through the kitchen and pantry area, directly to the
Colonial Room, which was being utilized as a press room
It was Mr. MURPHY's understanding that Mr. KENNEDY would
visit the press room to speak to various members of the press
and thank them for their cooperation.

Sometime during the speech, MURPHY realized thet
there was no one stationed at the double doors between
the Colonial and Embassy Rooms leading into the kitchen
area, so he generally stationed himself in that location
to prevent any of the crowd from coming into the kitchen
which could impede the Senator's proceeding from the
rear of the Embassy Room to the Colonial Room.

Mr. MURPHY stated that shortly after the Senator
had finished speaking, while he was still in the position
covering the double doors, he heard the sound of three quick
shots and in his own mind he immediately realized they were
gun shots. He left his station and proceeded into the pantry
area where he saw for the first time SIRHAN SIRHAN on a steam

table being held by two men and saw a gun in SIRHAN's

left hand. He immediately approached the suspect,
identified himself as a former lieutenant of the police
department, and attempted to get the gun from SIRHAN,

but was pushed away, by whom he does not know. Immediately
thereafter, ROOSEVELT GRIER obtained the gun and passed

it to RAFER JOHNSON. Mr. MURPHY advised JOHNSON to

put the gun in his, that is JOHNSON's, pocket. Mr.

MURPHY then immediately placed a call to the bell

captain to phone the police and obtain an ambulance.

Mr. MURPHY stated that he had not seen
SIRHAN prior to having observed him after the shooting
and does not recall seeing a woman in a white dress,
with or without polka dots in the general area.

Mr. MURPHY advised he was aware of no plans
of the Senator to visit the Ambassador Room and believed
that the Senator and his party were proceeding as originally
planned to the Colonial Room. He was aware of no change
in plans in the Senator's activities immediately after
the speech.

UNO TIMANSON, Vice President, Banquet and Sales,
Aubassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, was interviewed
concerning any possible last minute changes by Senator KENNEDY
and his party immediately following his victory speech and
before he was shot. Mr, TIMANSON advised that it was his
understanding that the Senator, following his victory speech,
would proceed to the Ambassador Ballroom where he would address
his supporters; however, just before the speech ended, FRED
DUTTON asked him if television sets had been set up in the
Ambassador Ballroom and it was immediately following this,
according to TIMANSON, that DUTTON indicated the Senator would
visit the Colonial Room, which was being used as press headquarters
TIMANSON had advised DUTTON that television sets had been set
up in the Ambassador Ballroom and TIMANSON is of the opinion
that the Senator possibly was going to skip going to the
Ambassador Ballroom insofar as his supporters in that room
were watching his victory speech on television. TIMANSON
stated that he left the podium to go to the Colonial Room and
observed there were no press representatives there and that only
four or five people were in the room working at the teletype
machine and apparently compiling election returns. TIMANSON
advised that he told Mr. DUTTON of the absence of the press and
that the press was located in the Embassy Room, but in spite
of this the Senator and his party, on leaving the stage, proceeded
through the Embassy kitchen area in the direction of the Colonial
Room. Mr. TIMANSON reiterated that he had no idea why a change
was made in their plans but that FRED DUTTON would be the one
who would have such knowledge.

Mr. TIMANSON advised that he could not recall from
whom he received instructions that the Senator intended to visit
the Ambassador Ballroom after hig speech and further it was his
understanding and feeling on his part that this would be his
itinerary.

I observed Juan Romero, an employee of the Ambassador
Hotel kneeling beside Senator Robert Francis Kennedy
who was laying on his back on the floor of the Embassy
Room Service Pantry. I ran to the side of Kennedy,
paused for about five seconds, then started to run
back to my office to call an ambulance.

"After taking about four steps from Kennedy
and Juan Romero, I observed a Negro male, who I later
learned was Roosevelt Grier, leaning against the west
end of a row of three steam tables. Grier had his
elbows on the top of the steam table, and as he shook
his head, sobbed several times, 'Oh no, Oh no.!

"About six feet down this same steam table from
where Grier was located, I observed three or four
unidentified persons wrestling with an individual
who was waving a pistol. I did not get a sufficient
observation of this individual or the gun he was waving
to enable me to recognize either in the future. All
I could see were three or four persons wrestling with
an unidentified individual whose arm was stretched
across the steam table as he waved the aforementioned
pistol.

"At this point many people began to converge on
the Service Pantry area, and I then ran to my office
to call an ambulance. When I arrived at my office,
the telephone was being used by another hotel employee;
therefore, I ran to the same entrance into the Embassy
Room Service Pantry and observed two Ambassador Hotel
employees, Eddie Minasian and Karl, last name unknown,
Roosevelt Grier, and another unidentified male Caucasian
attempting to protect another male Caucasian whose head
they were holding on the east end of the row of steam
tables. I attempted to see this individual's face, but
there were many persons surrounding him which blocked me
from observing him.

"I stood back from the steam tables and shouted
several times to protect him (the individual being
held at the steam table). I then observed Jesse Unruh
standing on top of the row of steam tables ordering
that this individual should be protected. At this time,
Niwa Yoshio, Cook at the Ambassador Hotel, said that I
should get some rope to tie the captured individual.
Thus, I returned to the Head Checker storage room,
obtained a segment of rubber extension cord, and quickly
returned to the Embassy Room Service Pantry. Someone
took the cord from me, then I returned to my office for
Iwas extremely nervous.

"Ayvout three to five minutes later, I returned
to the Eabassy Room Service Pantry. As I stood in the
northeast entrance, I observed three policemen take
the captured individual into their custody and walk
toward the east exit of the pantry. I quickly went to
the door and opened it for the police officers. As TI
