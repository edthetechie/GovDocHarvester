we would go on supporting Indonesia, come what may (I merely
reiterated the multilateral pattern of our commitment). Behind
his questioning on the military also seemed to be a Soviet view
that Indonesia was moving increasingly toward a military dic-
tatorship. (I acknowledged the ever-present danger of such a
trend, but indicated that it appeared less than likely in present
Indonesian circumstances.).

When queried concerning Soviet relations with Indnesia,
Lenkov noted that the massacre of Communists in Indonesia in
late 1965 inevitably continued to inhibit relationships, but
that Indonesia was an important country and the USSR intended
to maintain friendly relationships with the GOI for the fore-
seeable future.

Toward the end of dessert, Lenkov brought up Indonesia's
attitude toward Viet-Nam, but did not pursue the question,
seeming to be satisfied in his own mind on this issue. Such
comments as he did make were related more to what kind of
Viet-Nam Indonesia would accept after the fighting stopped
rather than Indonesia's attitude toward the war. He did
remark in an aside that the statements of some Indonesian
military officers on yiet-Nam looked as if they were made
to extract additional assistance from the United States. I
‘lowed as how that was not an unheard of phenomenon in the
world.
