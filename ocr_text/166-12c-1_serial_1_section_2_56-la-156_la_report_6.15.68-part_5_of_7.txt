at a time.. I'd like you to walk up to the dress and tell me
in your own words how this dress is the same or different
than the dress that was worn by the woman who you saw standing
next to the suspect just prior to the shooting. You want to
start with that first one right up there?

VINCENT: It's got, not that because it's, they are not polka
dots, they are squares, they are not even as big as the, they
are not the right kind.

PATCHETT: How about the color involved?

VINCENT: Sleeve length is too long and the collar is not the
same way at all; completely different.

PATCHETT: What's different about the collar?

VINCENT: The collar was not so high. It was more of a lower
based cut out.

PATCHETT: How about the bow?
VINCENT: The bow had, there was no bow at the top.

PATCHETT: How about the cut of the dress? That being an A
type cut as opposed to it being tailored.

VINCENT: No, it was more form fitting on the girl than the
AY.

PATCHETT: Alright, then let's go to the next dress.

VINCENT: This is not the dress at all. For one, there is no
polka dots, sleeve length is far too long, and the collar is
not at all like the dress.

PATCHETT: Fine, let's go to this next one here.

VINCENT: The same color of the dress, color and polka dots
near the same color.

MAN: Excuse me. How about the size of the polka dots?

VINCENT: The size is too small, completely too small, they
are much small even than, the sleeve length is also again too
long and the front, the collar is somewhat like this except
that it's not as high again, this is a little too high and

it had no frills on it at all.

PATCHETT: Alright VINCENT, let's go to the fourth dress here.
VINCENT: This is the same color, in fact, the same size polka

dots about the same size. I would say they are the same size
I saw.


--- Page 3 ---

LA 56-156

PATCHETT: Would you describe that as a nedium size polka dot,

as opposed to the other one being a small one?

VINCENT: Yes, I would say this is a medium size.

PATCHETT: Alright, how about the cut of that dress?

VINCENT: The cut is more like, this is more like because it
is tapered in, like I say, it was form fitting, more tight
around the waist.

PATCHETT: How about the collar?

VINCENT: The collar is again too high and it had no white

in front and it had, on the sleeve, the sleeve length is
about the same.

PATCHETT: It's a very very short sleeve.

VINCENT: Very short sleeve, like this.

PATCHETT: Let's go then to the fifth dress.

VINCENT: This again is not, the pattern is pretty good but
the sleeves are, there is no sleeves in this case, and it's
not the dress that I saw.

PATCHETT: Alright, let's go to this one then, the sixth dress.

VINCENT: Again, it's not the dress. Couldn't be, the frills,
the collar on this is, on this is up to the neck, which I
nought it came down to here. The collar actually came down

to about here, about the middle, here.

PATCHETT: What you're saying then is the.neck would be
exposed and....

VINCENT: The neck would be exposed, in this case it's not
exposed. Right?

PATCHETT: Was there a bow?


--- Page 4 ---

LA 56-156

VINCENT: No, there was no bow.
PATCHETT: How about the sleeve length involved here?

VINCENT: No, the sleeves here aren't, I mean, not the same
length.

PATCHETT: Let me exchange places with you and go to this
one, number seven.

VINCENT: No, the collar on this is similar to the dress the
girl was wearing, except as I say it came down more to where
the end of this bow would be, it came down to about here.
PATCHETT: Alright.

VINCENT: And the sleeve length is the same but the polka
dots they are mixed colors. It's not......

PATCHETT: How about the size of your dots?

VINCENT: The size again. It's just under the size of the..
PATCHETT: A little bit smaller.

VINCENT: Yeah, a little bit smaller.

PATCHETT: How about the top of this garment here?

VINCENT: Which one?

PATCHETT: That one there.

VINCENT: No, this is more like a tiger or something else, not
it at all.

PATCHETT: Any possibility that the print on that one and the
print on this one here which is number __» could have been
mistaken for polka dots?

--- Page 5 ---

LA 56-156

VINCENT: No, not sic. IL saw the print distinctly, this wasn't
it at all.

PATCHETT: Okay, thank you very: much for this statement.
(Pause)

PATCHETT: VINCENT, I'd like you to take the dresses down off
the wali that you feel resemble most nearly the one that was
on the woman that you saw that evening. That's number four
you have there,: right?

VINCENT: Yes, sir.

PATCHETT: Can you hold that up to the camera so they can get
a good shot of it?

VINCENT: Yes, as I said before. It's the same type of polka
dots and the collar was more like on the reverse side,

xcept it came down to about the middle here exposing part of
the girl's neck.
PATCHETT: It would be a wider collar?
VINCENT: It would be a wider collar.
PATCHETT: Were there polka dots on the collar?
VINCENT: Yes, there were polka dots on the collar.
PATCHETT: Alright, fine. Why don't you just lay that dress
down and take the next one off the wall that in your mind
comes closest to being that that the woman was wearing. This
then is number....
VINCENT: Seven.
PATCHETT: Seven. Correct.

VINCENT: This, again, is the collar, basically Tike this one,
but it was solid like I have shown you in this dress here.


--- Page 6 ---

LA 56-156

PATCHETT: Right.

VINCENT: It came down to about where the end of the bow is
risht about the center here. It came down to about there and
a curve curve.

PATCEZTT; Let's discuss a couple of things here. The size
of tha polka dots between the two dresses, which one would
be most nearly correct.

VINCENT: The first dress, number four.

PATCEETT: How about the sleeve length?

VINCENT: Sleeve length. I believe they are the same but

I would say more like this one because I would say more of
the erm would be exposed than this.

PATCHETT: Alright. One final question. VINCE, how much of
this woman were you able to see that evening?

VINCENT: Approximately, just to about the knee, that's as
far as I covld see.

PATCHETT: You could see her from the knee -up.
VINCENT: Up, the knee up.

PATCHETT: And she was wearing a dress rather than a polka
dot blouse and a different colored skirt.

VINCENT: Yes, sir.

PATCHETT: The length of the dress in relation to her knee,
mini dress or what?

VINCENT: No, it was about, I would say, posgibly an inch,
maybe two inches above the knee, but not a mini.

PATCHETT: Alright. (Pause) VINCENT have you ever seen these
dresses before today, before this meeting?

dress to me is that correct?

SANDRA SERRANO was shown the location in the
kitchen area of the Embassy Ballroom, Ambassador Hotel,
by SA RICHARD C. BURRIS and Deputy District Attorneys JOHN
HOWARD and DAN JOHNSON. She was shown the stage area where
Senator KENNEDY gave his speech and the route to the kitchen
area from the stage area was explained to her by SA BURRIS.
SERRANO was advised by SA BURRIS that approximately 1100 people,
plus numerous pieces of television equipment, were reportedly
in the Embassy Room at the time of the speech. She was told the
maximum occupancy of the room was listed as 750, which is a
good indication of the crowded conditions. SERRANO was then

walked across the Embassy Ballroom at the southwest corner, through

the fire exit doors and onto the outside fire escape stairs she
claimed to have been sitting on at the time Senator KENNEDY was
shot. It was suggested to her this distance is approximately
170 feet. SERRANO was reminded that during previous interviews
she indicated she had been on these steps when she heard what
she thought to be six backfires. She had also indicated that
approximately thirty seconds after hearing the backfires, she
claimed she saw a woman wearing a white dress with black polka
dots, running down the steps past her. The woman said, "We
shot him. We shot him." SERRANO asked, "Who?" and the

woman said, “Senator KENNEDY". SERRANO had previously stated that
approximately 25 minutes before hearing what she thought was
backfires, this same woman and man, plus another man, walked

up the stairs past her. She said after seeing the photograph

of SIRHAN SIRHAN in the paper, she was certain the man walking
up the stairs, who did not return down the stairs, was identical
to SIRHAN.

SERRANO was asked by SA BURRIS that after seeing the
location of the shooting, in relation to where she was sitting
on the steps if she still felt she had heard the shots.
SERRANO said she had never heard a gunshot in her life and
never claimed she had heard gunshots, but had described what
she heard as six backfires, four or five of which were close

together.

SERRANO was told by SA BURRIS that her parents in
Ohio had been interviewed and her mother stated that she,
SANDRA, had not mentioned the fact she had seen someone she,
SANDRA, felt was connected with the shooting. SERRANO explained
she has always hed difficulty communicating with her mother
and was not able to talk to her to explain anything. She
said she wanted to talk to her father, but her father would
not talk to her, since her father was apparently too upset
about hearing that Senator KENNEDY had been shot.

SERRANO was asked by SA BURRIS, why, in her interview
on television, following the shooting, she had not said
anything about seeing this woman and the two men go up the
stairs, but only told about the woman and man coming back
down. It was pointed out to her the fact she claimed one of
the men going up the stairs was SITRHAN SIRHAN was the most
significant part of the incident described by her. SERRANO
stated she could not explain why and accused those present
of lying to her and trying to trick her. SA BURRIS then asked
SERRANO at what point she felt she was lied to, or tricked, and
she said that SA BURRIS had once referred to the polka dot
dress as a black polka dot dress, rather than a white dress
with black polka dots.

Deputy District Attorney JOHN HOWARD then asked
SERRANO if she would take a polygraph examination in an
effort to verify what she had seen. She indicated she would
take a polygraph and she then was asked by HOWARD to reenact
the incident on the steps so it might be video taped to avoid
any misunderstanding on anyone's part as to what she claims to
heve seen. SERRANO agreed, but prior to making the video tape
she insisted in having someone present not connected with the
investigation.

Several Ambassador Hotel employees were arranged for
by HOWARD to act as witnesses and 411 but two-employees from the
hotel kitchen were rejected by SERRANO, who gave no reason for
her rejection.

SANDRA: About the, could be a little bigger, about the

PATCHETT: About that size, maybe a little bit bigger.
How about this dress, number’ four?

SANDRA: No. It's too, stands out too much.
PATCHETT: Polka dots are too large?

SANDRA: Too large, and it's a half waist, the collar is
wrong and it had a big bow. .

PATCHETT: How about the sleeves?

SANDRA: The sleeves are longer.

PATCHETT: Definitely too short. How about this dress here?
SANDRA: No, definitely not. ,

PATCHETT: Is there any possibility that that pattern dress
could have been mistaken for polka dots by you?

SANDRA: Not in my mind, there isn't.

PATCHETT: That's the closest one. Now, that dress has
squares, rather than dots. How about the dress you saw that
evening?

SANDRA: I believe it was polka dots.

PATCHETT: You believe it was polka dots, not squares. So the
number of squares on that dress would that be about the same
number of dots that were on the other one?

SANDRA: About the same.

PATCHETT: How about this one here? Let me move over here and
you can step up to this dress here. How about that one?

SANDRA: No.

which other dress would you say was most similar? If another
one is.

SANDRA: In which way?

PATCHETT: Generally, as far as one that is cut closest to
it or one that has polka dots of the closest size to it.

SANDRA: Actually, none of them.

PATCHETT: None of them. How about the dress number three?
Were the dots about that size? Or larger?

SANDRA: A bit larger.

PATCHETT: A bit larger than that. Would they be about the
size of these?

SANDRA: No, those are too large?

PATCHETT: Those are too large, so that'this dress that we

SANDRA: Right.

PATCHETT: And as far as the number of dots, on the dress,
it would be roughly this many?

SANDRA: Right.

PATCHETT: As opposed to something like this?

SANDRA: Yes.

most nearly resembled the dress that the girl was wearing

PATCHETT: Alright. Is there anything else that you can think
of in regard to the dress that the girl was wearing that you
would like to tell us about at this time?
SANDRA: No.
PATCHETT: Alright, thank you.
(Pause)
SANDRA: The dress was the same cut, this is a A-line cut, it
had sleeves on it which I believe were three quarter length
It had bib collar, with either a frill or rick rack around it
and it had a bow with a stand up collar.
PATCHETT: Alright, fine. Thank you, SANDRA.

. NAJEEB H. KHOURY was interviewed at his residence,
5767 Fountain Avenue, Apartment 8. After the agents identified
themselves, KHOURY was advised of the FBI's interest in the
shooting of U.S. Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

KHOURY advised he was a Medical student, University of
Guadalajara, Mexico City, Mexico. He returns to Los Angeles
each vacation and during the summer to make enough money for
the next semester's expenses. During these periods he plays
the "Oud", a musical instrument, at the Arabian night club,

La Fez, 1508 North Vermont, Los Angeles. SIRHAN SIRHAN had a
brother, ADEL SIRHAN, who also worked at the La Fez, but KHOURY
was only casually acquainted with him. Through this brother,
KHOURY met two or three other members of the SIRHAN family,

but he never knew SIRHAN SIRHAN. The only time KHOURY ever
visited the STRHAN home was approximately one year ago following
the death of AIDA SIRHAN, a sister and the victim of Leukemia.

KHOURY stated he had always been pro-KENNEDY. He
explained that he considered President JOHN F. KENNEDY a real
friend of the Arabs and felt ROBERT F. KENNEDY shared these
views. For this reason he was shocked that a Jordanian, or
any Arab for that matter, would kill ROBERT KENNEDY. KHOURY
denied that he belonged to any organizations, pro-Arab or
otherwise.

Attorney, Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, advised
SA R, J. LA JEUNESSE, JR. as follows:

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge ARTHUR L.
ALARCON requested attorney A. L. WIRIN, associated with the
American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles, to consult with
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. This request was made in open court by
Judge ALARCON, at which time Judge ALARCON pointed out he desired
WIRIN to consult with SIRHAN to insure that all of SIRHAN's
constitutional rights would be fully protected.

WIRIN, after consulting with SIRHAN, has issued public
statements indicating it was his desire that the California Bar
Association appoint a criminal attorney to represent SIRHAN,
subject to SIRHAN's personal approval.

On June 11, 1968, WIRIN consulted with Los Angeles
County Superior Court Presiding Judge DONALD WRIGHT. As a
result of this meeting, it appears that WILBUR LITTLEFIELD,
Chief Trial Attorney for the Los Angeles County Public Defender's
Office, will represent SIRHAN.

Tentative plans of the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's Office are that Mr. LYNN COMPTON, Chief Deputy District
Attorney, will head the prosecutive staff in future court
proceedings.

STEPHEN HENRY TAPPAN, 428 North Los Robles,
Pasadena, California, was interviewed by SAs JOSEPH A.
CHEFALO and WAYNE L, BOURQUE, who identified themselves as
Agents of the FBI. TAPPAN was warned of his rights and waived
them as shown on an executed warning and waiver form.

It was explained to TAPPAN that he was being
interviewed concerning the placing of an ad in the Jobs
Wanted Section of the "Free Press", a weekly newspaper published
in Los Angeles, which read, "I must have $1,000.00. Do
anything. wree to travel, danger OK. Call 793-2212 between
7 - p.m.

TAPPAN stated that he placed the ad in the
"Free Press" because he needs money to get started ina
gold mining venture near Apache Junction, Arizona. He is
very interested in gold mining and has placed an ad in the
"California Mining Journal" asking for work in gold mines.
This acd resulted in his becoming acquainted with one MARTHA
AYLOR, Ironwood Street, Apache Junction, Arizona, who owns
property near Apache Junction on which some abandoned mines
are located. TAPPAN visited AYLOR, who is over 70 years old,
looked over the mines and believes he has found the "Lost
Dutchman's Mine." He has agreed to work the mine for AYLOR,
put he needs $2,000.00 to get started. He placed the ad
in the "Free Press" because no other Los Angeles newspaper
would allow such an ad.

TAPPAN is presently employed as a dishwasher at
the Western Coffee Shop, 156 South Rosemead, Pasadena,
California, because he is unable to obtain a better job due to
a "raw deal" he received from the United States Government.
The "raw deal" was a medical discharge from the United States
Army (USA). TAPPAN enlisted in the USA in 19650 and
requested training in electronics or communications but was
instead assigned to the cavalry, specializing in tanks.

He was very unhappy about this assignment and felt he

should have gotten what ne had requested. TAPPAN admitted
that he intentionally tried for a medical discharge, because
née was so unhappy with the military. He did not think it
was wrong to do this.

Prior to enlisting in the U. S. Army, TAPPAN received
treatment from a Dr. DUBE (phonetic) in Center Ossippee,
New Hampshire, from the fall of 1959 to the summer of 1960,
for “extreme nervousness," While in the Army, TAPPAN also
received treatment for “extreme nervousness" before
receiving his medical discharge.

After being discharged, TAPPAN stayed at his home
in South Tamworth, New Hampshire, until June of 1962. He
then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and lived at 64 Westland
' Avenue for approximately two years. While in Boston he
worked at numerous jobs, none of which amounted to anything
important. In 1964, TAPPAN moved to Pasadena, California,
and lived at 70 South Grand for approximately one and one
half years before moving to his present address at 428 North
Los Robles. TAPPAN has had the ad in the "Free Press"
since about the first week in March. He stated he has
received numerous calls from cranks but has received a few
legitimate offers. One offer was from a JOHN REISMAN, and
a JOHN PHILLIPS, telephone number 628-4421, who offered
TAPPAN a job driving automobiles to the East Coast for
which he would be paid $800.00 a trip; however, TAPPAN
has not been able to confirm the offer, as he has been unable
to contact those individuals at the telephone number given.
Another offer received by telephone has to do with "industrial
espionage." TAPPAN advised he received a call about one
and one half weeks ago from an unknown male who asked if he
would be interested in the above type work. When TAPPAN
indicated he would be, the caller advised ne would contact
TAPPAN at a future date. On or about June 6, 1968, TAPPAN
was visited by a man he described as a white male, 5'4",
slim build, swartny complexion, long dark brown hair, odd
shaped face, wearing very expensive, dark blue, iridescent
suit, pointed black shoes with buckles, who talked about

TAPPAN working in “industrial espionage." This individual
told TAPPAN to gtudy the Italian language, ag he would

possibly be in Italy in this line of work. This individual ,
did not identify himsel? but said he would contact TAPPAN
again,

TAPPAN is very desperate for work and advised
that he would accept almost anytning, however, he would not
accept anything illegal. He further advised that since
placing the ad in the newspaper, he has not received any
calls concerning the assassination of ROBERT F, KENNEDY.
He stated that he would not get involved in anything of that
nature.

member of his family. ALLEN said that when reading all of
the publicity regarding the KENNEDY assassination, she became
very concerned for the mother of the accused assassin, SIRHAN
SIRHAN, and wanted t> help her in any way she could during
this time of sorrow.

ALLEN said she read in the newspaper an article
which listed a neighbor of SIRHAN by the name of MARGUERITE
DAUGHERTY, 709 East Howard Street and telephonically contacted
Mrs. DAUGHERTY to see if there was any way she could help
SIRHAN's mother.

ALLEN advised that she is 83 years of age and three
years ago had traveled around the world as a type of goodwill
ambassador for the State of California. She stated that she
was not employed for the State of California but merely did
this on her own as she wanted to inform other countries of
the life in America and also obtain information regarding how
other peoples of the world live.

ALLEN stated that she has been a member of the
United American Arab Congress, Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles,
and also the Asia Society, Hollywood, California, for approxi-
mately two years. ALLEN said that her main interest in life
is to educate the people in the United States about foreign
countries and especially the Arab countries. She stated that
she felt that the American people were indirectly guilty for
Senator KENNEDY's death because of our ignorance to the
problems confronting other countries of the world, especially
the Arab and Jewish world.
