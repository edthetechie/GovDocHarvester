Vice President Huhert H. Humphrey
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Dear Vice President Humphrey:

Is it true that deep in the hills of Castro's Cuba, a cult of chaos creators
exists, dedicated to the assasination of selected U.S. public figures, those whose
death by violence will fan the flames,apsetting many and bringing about more

violence?

Is three a plot, managed by skilled pros, who seek out sick stooges as tools to

do their dirty deeds? Was Oswald a manipulated stooge and was he himself assasinated
so that he would not talk? Is Sirhan another stooge? Was Martin Luther King slain by

a third stooge? Are these people so cleverly manipulated that they are themselves
unaware of being but the hand on the gun? All these are questions that run through
the minds of those who have never been satisfied that Oswald was totally a loner.

The confirmed visits of. both Oswald and Galt to Mexico where contact with Castro

agents would be easy and of Galt to New Orleans appear suspicious. Has Sirhan visited

Mexico recantly? Has he been to New ‘Orleans? Who has he seen in these past few
months since he became unemployed?

If these acts have all been plots, did the same people manage all three plots.

their base of operations in Cuba? Is it a subsidized project of the Castro government?

All these and many other questions need be answered. Sirhan's life must be

protected. His contacts must be searched out.’ With due respect for the rights of the

individual, this man who was seen by many in the. execution of his act, must be
interrogated and led to disclose others who aided, supervised or manipulated him.
these three tragedies are linked it is urgent that those responsible be uncovered,
caught and punished before they move on to their next targets.

Sincerely,
CHEMTREE CORPORATION

Also Known As

Alejandro Zaldovosqui Zamora “~~~ ~

On July 1, 1968, Lic, Norberto Salinas Navarette,
Federal District Attorney, Juarez, Mexico, advised that
Curiel had been found to be psychotic and on receipt of
specific instructions from Mexico City, Curiel had been
interned at the General Hospital for the Insane, Juarez,
Mexico, Salinas noted he had made a recommendation that
Curiel be sent to another institution more adequately
equipped to handle juveniles, and he was advised that
any decision in this regard would necessarily have to
-be made by the administrator of the hospital,

Salinas recalied that Curiel, on realizing what
he had done by attracting so much attention to himself,
openly admitted the entire story was a hoax, and he readily
criticized newspaper reporters, administration officials,
and police officers for being so gullible as to believe
this fantastic story.

On July 5, 1968, Salinas advised that Curiel,
while in solitary confinement at the General Hospital
for tne Insane, aad put together a rope from the
mattress material located in his room and he hung
himself, He was discovered dead at approximately 7:46 p,m,

on the evening of July 4, 1968, by an attendant of the
hospital,

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Press reports indicate that Grant B. Cooper,
a Los Angeles, California, attorney, will serve as an
additional defense counsel for Sirhan Bishara Sirhan,
accused assassin of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Martin-
dale-Hubbell Law Directory reveals one Grant B. Cooper,
born in 1903, was admitted to practice in 1927 and
attended law school at Southwestern University in Los
Angeles, California. For your information, there follows
a brief summary of data in our files concerning Grant Cooper.

In 1941 the chief investigator for the Jack Tenny
Committee investigating communism in California advised that
one Grant Cooper, then on the Los Angeles County District
Attorney's staff, and close to Mayor Fletcher Bowron, was
married to a daughter of Mrs, Norton, Mayor Bowron's secre-
tary. Phyllis Norton Cooper, the wife, was reportedly a
former close associate of Celeste Strack, a prominent
Young Communist League leader in Southern California and
formerly active in New York City.

News and other sources reported in 1949 that
Mr. Cooper was the attorney for a bit actress, Lila Leeds,
who was arrested along with Robert Mitchum and others on a
narcotics charge. Reportedly Mr. Cooper had as one of his
associates in his law firm the son of Los Angeles County
Sheriff, Eugene W. Biscailuz.

Mr. Cooper represented one Samuel Jesse Berland
in his appearance before the House Committee on Un-American
Activities in April, 1956. Berland, according to our files,
was prominent in communist activities in the Los Angeles
area for an extended period of time, — j

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY

Grant Cooper was the attorney in 1957 for one
Philip Watler, a business agent of a Local Teamster's

- Union in California, in connection with a Grand Jury

indictment for perjury.

In November, 1960, the Governor of California
established a Special Committee on Insanity and Criminal
Offenders to study insanity in relationship to law. Attor-
ney Grant Cooper of Los Angeles, who reportedly defended
Dr. Bernard Finch for wife murder, acted as chairman of one
of the discussions of this committee.

In connection with an investigation of James Riddle
Hoffa in 1961, a reliable source advised that he had contacted
one Bill Bufalino, Teamster official in Detroit, Michigan,
and was instructed to telephonically contact a Mrs. Williams
at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, and assist her. The
source discovered that Mrs. Williams was in fact Viola Carbo,
wife of Paul John (Frank) Carbo, then under prosecution for
extortion and anti-racketeering in connection with the boxing
racket. Mrs. Carbo requested the source to locate an attorney
for her husband. Source took Mrs. Carbo to the home of
Grant Cooper, at which time Cooper set his fee for representing
Carbo at $50,000. Mrs. Carbo indicated that she would have to
make the payment in cash rather than by check and Cooper
advised that he was not interested in handling the case in
that manner.

In June, 1962, it was reported that Grant B. Cooper
was the ‘Southern Committee Vice Chairman Pro-Tem of the
National Council on Crime and Delinquency. The announced
purpose of the organization was to formulate a "crash" program
to marshal the best know-how and experience in the State to
bear on crime and delinquency.

Grant Cooper has represented numerous other individ-
uals in the criminal element as well as one Chinese espionage
subject who was under deportation proceedings in the Los
Angeles area and is rated as a very prominent capable criminal
trial lawyer according to news sources.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

The Los Angeles, California, Police Department advise

on June 25, 1968, Munir Sirhan, brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, was
afforded a polygraph examination. It was concluded by the police depart-
‘ment that Munir Sirhan was not involved in the assassination, but that he
did lie about the purchase of the gun. (The gun used in the assassination
was traced through several owners, one of whom, George Erhard, advised
that he sold the gun to Munir Sirhan while Sirhan Sirhan was present.
‘Munir had denied that he ever had ownership of this weapon. }

The polygraph exainination indicated that Munir Sirhan did not
accompany Sirhan Sirhan to a gun shop on June 1, 1668, when Sirhan "
Sirhan purchased ammunition. (A salesman at this store had stated that =.
Sirhan Sirhan was accompanied by two as yet unidentified individuals when ~:
he purchased ammunition on June 1, 1968.)

hu,
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to s
authorize $20,000 for the protection of Sirhan Sirhan and the judge and jury =
that will be concerned with his trial. This money will be spent to install fz
armor-plated courtroom partitions, bulletproof glass and other security u
devices. : ~
Ks

On June 28, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan appeared before Superior Court ; -
Judge Richard B. Schauer, Los Angeles, California, in order to enter a
plea to the indictment pertaining to the assassination of Senator Robert F. .
Kennedy and the wounding of five other individuals. Court was convened *
in the chapel of the Los Angeles County Jail for security reasons.

Mr. Russell E. Parsons, who represented Sirhan, was officially
substituted by the court as the attorney of record replacing the Public
Defender's Office, Mr. Parsons advised the court that he was not yet

ready to have Sirhan enter a plea and he requested a three-week continuance,
Mr. Parsons also requested that the court appoint Doctor George Abe,
psychiatrist with the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, California, to
examine Sirhan. The judge granted these requests and court was adjourned
until July 19, 1968. Mr. Lynch's office was telephonically advised of this
on June 28, 1968. :

Honorable Edward J. Gurney V25, 1asy

Washington, D. C.

Dear Congressmans

, The Attorney General has asked me to respond to your letter
of June 26, 1968, enclosing two newspaper articles aent to you by your
constituent, Mra. M. R. Dowd of Fort Myers.

The thrust of both articles seems to be primarily that cer-
tain recent decisions of the Supreme Court have shifted the balance
of advantage in criminal trials to the accused. In this connection
one of the articles makes specific reference to the alleged assassin
of Senator Robert Kennedy. The articles also suggest that the Court's
decisions are the cause of increased lawlessness in the nation, and
that the Justices, by reason of their age, are unable to respond to the
wishes of the majority of the population.

The causes of orime are complex and deeply rooted in our
society. In the judgment of most parsons knowledgeable in the field
of law enforcement, the recent decisions of the Supreme Court have had no
adverse effect on the incidence of crime in this country. Perhaps the
best racent analysis of the problem of crime in the United States is
contained in the Report of the President's Crime Commission entitled
"The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society." The Report, which Mra. Dowd
may wish to obtain, is available from the U. 3. Government Printing
Office, Washington, D. C. 2002, at a price of $2.25 per copy.

Unfortunately, the articles sent to you by Mrs. Dowd nourish
the wholly inaccurate attitude by our citizens that they have done their
part in the war against crime by deciding whether they are for or
against the Supreme Court. Such simplistic answers do us no service
in our effort to find solutions for the complicated problems wa face
in the war against crime.

As to the alleged failure of the Supreme Court's decioiong
to comport with the desires of the people, I would like to point out
that it is not the function of the judiciary to express the wijy o¢

the majority. Rather, the courts are sworn to uphold the Constitu-

I trust that ay reply ie a sufficient response to your

the United States government.
We have these old fogies in
the Supreme Court who are
living in the past. They have
taken to making the laws of
country rather than making
an interpretation of the law. .
According to the Supreme
Court a policeman can no
longer shoot a criminal who
draws a gun on him without
being charged with man-

These“old men are“ too old

Abpvinted_ for life, Retiromes}
at 65 should be the rute for
all. members of the govern-
ment. The majority of the
United States Population is un-
der 50 years of age. ‘The older
men, have no. idea of what
they think or. how they’ fee],
This is a young country; filled,

young people, The police can,
no longer interrogate a pri-

The country is going to hell
in a handbasket because. of,
the rulings of these nine old

realize at 64 that I am not
