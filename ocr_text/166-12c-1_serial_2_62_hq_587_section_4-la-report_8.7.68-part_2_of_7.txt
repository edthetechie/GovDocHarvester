AUGUSTIN V. CHAVEZ, age 70, Apartment No. 5, 52-849
Highway 86, Adobe Courts, Coachella, California, does not speak
English and was interviewed in the Spanish language with Patrol
Inspector A.M. PARKER, United States Border Patrol, acting as
interpreter.

Mr. CHAVEZ advised that he formerly lived at the Marshall
Auto Court, 83-257 Highway 99, Indio, California, and in June 1968,
wrote a letter to Congressman JOHN TUNNEY concerning the death of
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

Mr. CHAVEZ stated that he hac no first hand knowledge
of the killing of Senator KENNEDY, as he (CHAVEZ) was in Coachella
the night KENNEDY was shot. Mr. CHAVEZ predicted that President
JOHN KENNEDY, MARTIN LUTHER KING and Senator ROBERT KENNEDY would
be killed before it happened and he told MANUEL ALVAREZ MORENO
and Mrs. NAVAREZ about his prediction and they could verify that
he made such a prediction. MORENO and NAVAREZ have no other
knowledge of the matter, according to CHAVEZ.

Mr. CHAVEZ advised that God had revealed this to him
and this was "God's prediction" and not just his. At the time he
made the prediction he (CHAVEZ) did not know who would do the
killing, and has no other information concerning the death of
Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. CHAVEZ added that the United States has a political
type government which we cannot continue with unless we talk with
and seek the help of one person. If we do not seek the help and
counsel of this person we will have a lot of Vietnams. CHAVEZ
identified this person as ex-president of Mexico, CARDENAS.

Mr. FRANCIS D. CULLEN, also known es Frank Cullen,
4558 Laurel Canyon Drive, North Hollywood, California,
telephone 761-2537, furnished the following information:

Mr. CULLEN said that he was 62 years of age
and a motion picture grip by occupation, having worked
at various motion picture studios in the past, and was
currently unemployed due to health,

During the 1954 presidential campaign of JOHN F.
KENNEDY, CULLEN worked on behalf of KENNEDY in the Los Angeles
area. :

On or about March 22 or March 23, 1968, CULLEN
read an article in the "Herald Examiner" that Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY was to make a campaign appearance
at the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel, 12825 Ventura Boulevard,
North Hollywood, California. This being close to CULLEN's
home, the latter went to the Sportsmen's Lodge on March 24,
1968, at approximately 7:00 p.m., to greet Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY, who CULLEN had met during the 1964 KENNEDY presidential
campaign.

Upon arrival of the Senator KENNEDY party at the
Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel, Senator KENNEDY recognized FRANK CULLEN
asking the latter to direct him to the hotel room where KENNEDY
was to stay. CULLEN accompanied Senator KENNEDY to the room
assigned him on the fifth floor, possibly room 508. When
Senator KENNEDY got to his room the question of a security
guard came up and PIERRE SALINGER and a man named BRUNO with
the KENNEDY party, asked CULLEN to stand by outside of the
KENNEDY room on the fifth floor and act as a security guard.
CULLEN agreed and one of the secretaries of Senator KENNEDY
took CULLEN's name and address.

Approximately 15 to 20 minutes after CULLEN
became an active security guard, which would have been
between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., a young man came up to the
fifth floor on the elevator carrying what appeared to be
a camera on a strap over his shoulder. He said to CULLEN
that he wanted to take a picture of Senator KENNEDY. The
object, thought to be a camera,was about five inches by
elght inches wide and three to four inches high. It was
encased in a dark brown leather-type case. When advised
that Mr. KENNEDY was not available and that the fifth floor
had been restricted, the young man was instructed to leave
whereupon he declined and sat down on a chest in the hallway
The Senator stepped out of his room to make an inquiry about
the whereabouts of a certain pair of cufflinks. The young
man was still in the hallway at this time.

Mr. JOSEPH GARSON, who was one of the managers
of the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel, was present and asked CULLEN
if he did not think that the young man wanted more than
a picture of KENNEDY. Consequently, CULLEN asked the young
man to get up from the chest and get on the elevator which
he reluctantly did. CULLEN noted that this young man
stayed in the elevator approximately 15 minutes going up
and down and controlling the elevator.

CULLEN finally, after certain protests from the
young man who claimed that CULLEN had no right to remove
him from the hotel hallway, got the young man out of the
elevator and completely out of the hotel and into the parking
lot. This was the last time CULLEN observed the young man
and did not observe anyone else with the young man, nor did
CULLEN ascertain the name of the young man or whether sr not
he had an automobile.

The young man was described by CULLEN as being
a male white, 5'8", 20 to 24 years of age, dark complexion,
dark eyes, clean shaven, dark kinky curly hair, and not well
groomed.

Following the assassination of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY, Mr. CULLEN observed a picture of SITRHAN SIRHAN
in the newspaper and noted a resemblance between the
photograph and the young man who attempted to take a
photograph of Senator KENNEDY at the Sportsmen's Lodge
Hotel on the evening of March 24, 1968.

Mr. CULLEN said that he attempted to relay the
information regarding the young man observed on March 24,
1963, to PETER LAWFORD, actor and former brother-in-law of
Senator KENNEDY. LAWFORD, at the time, was associated with
actor ~ producer JERRY LEWIS making a film at Columbia
Pictures Studio in Hollywood. The call to this studio
disclosed that PETER LAWFORD was not available and the
information was given by telephone to JERRY LEWIS by
Mr. CULLEN to be passed on to PETER LAWFORD

A group of photographs containing photographs
of SIRHAN SIRHAN, his brothers, ADEL, SHARIF, MUNIR, and
SATIDALLAH, were exhibited to FRANK CULLEN, without identifying
the photographs by first or last names. Mr. CULLEN examined
the photographs carefully and selected the photograph of
SHARIF SIRHAN as very closely resembling the young man
who had attempted to photograph Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
at the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel on March 24, 1968.

It was noted at the time that CULLEN selected
the photograph of SHARIF SIRHAN he was unable to talk,
started to perspire and appeared to be visibly shaken.
A lapse of approximately one and a half minutes followed
before Mr. CULLEN acknowledged that he had become emotionally
upset at seeing the photograph of SHARIF and believing that
it was a photograph of the young man whom CULLEN had encountered
on March 24, 1968. CULLEN noted that the hair on the young
man in question at the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel, as he recalled,
looked more like the hair of SIRHAN SIRHAN as depicted in the
photograph exhibited to him, which photograph was taken by
the Los Angeles Police Department on June 5, 1968.

TA 56-156

Upon further examination of the photographs,
CULLEN said he was still of the opinion that the photograph
of SHARIF more closely resembled the man in question at the
Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel.

Mr. CULLEN was of the opinion that Mr. JOSEPH
GARSON should have some opinion in the matter as he had
called GARSON following the assassination of Senator KENNEDY
and they both agreed that the young man at the Sportsmen's
Lodge Hotel on March 24, 1968, attempting to photograph
Senator KENNEDY, closely resembled the photographs of
STRHAN SIRHAN which had appeared in the newspapers on June 5,
19655.

Mr. MARK HARLIG, Manager of Sportman's Lodge Hotel,
12833 Ventura Boulevard, North Hollywood, California,
telephone 769-4700, advised as follows:

Mr. HARLIG said that during a fund raising dinner
and cocktail party on March 24, 1968, held at the Sportman's
Lodge, which featured an appearance by Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY, no security guards had been hired by the hotel or the
lodge., | He had no knowledge of a security guard being hired
by the KENNEDY party. He also had no knowledge of any
individual by the name of FRANK CULLEN, reportedly a security
guard at the Sportsman's Lodge. He mentioned that the lodge
and hotel did not have a security squad staff and rarely did
they hire one. Frequently organizations who have conventions
or affairs at the hotel and lodge hire their own security
guards.

During the aforementioned KENNEDY party, a large
number of people apparently got word of it and showed up at the
hotel and lodge in an apparent attempt to observe Senator KENNEDY.
They were all over the hotel and grounds.

Photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and his brothers,
ADEL, SHARIF and MUNIR were shown to HARLIG, who commented he
had ho recollection of seeing these individuals around the hotel
or lodge during the KENNEDY party on March 24, 1968 or any other
time. The other logical employee to whom the * photographs should
be shown is Bellman BOB LOCHRIE, who was on duty and was ina
position to see anyone hanging around the hotel when Senator
KENNEDY was there on March 24, 1968

Concerning persons in the KENNEDY party, who may have
hired a security officer or otherwise, know who may have observed
persons around the hotel at the time, they could probably be
identified through JERRY BRUNO, who. was an advanceman for the
KENNEDY party about a year ago and may still be connected with
them. No specific address was available for JERRY BRUNO
according to Mr. HARLIG.

Mrs. JACKIE LAWRENCE, Manager of Banquet Department,
Sportman's Lodge, 12833 Ventura Boulevard, North Hollywood,
California, Telephone TR 7-9846, advised as follows:

She was unable to identify anyone by the name of
FRANK CULLEN, reportedly a Security Guard at the Sportman's
Lodge She mentioned that this lodge did not employ a
security guard as such There were numerous security guards
employed at the lodge from time to time by organizations
who utilize the facilities of the Sportman's Lodge Hotel and
Restaurant. The specific organization would have to be
identified, together with the date, to establish who may have
been hired.

With respect to the fund raising dinner and cocktail
party, at $250 a plate, attended by Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY,
it was held on the evening of March 24, 1968 at the lodge,
from approximately 8:00 p.m until 11:30 p.m. Mr. PIERRE
SALINGER had made the original contact and reservations for
the lodge for this affair. Senator KENNEDY had stayed in
the adjoining hotel and had arrived at the party at
approximately 9:30 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. He came in through
the kitchen to the dining area where he ate dinner and
subsequently went into the cocktail party area, which was
behind a glass partition. Approximately 300 people, who were
not invited to this affiar, which was rather confidential and
attended by a group of prominent supporters of Senator KENNEDY,
had gathered around the hotel and in the lodge for the purpose
of observing Senator KENNEDY. When Senator KENNEDY observed
this crowd of people standing outside the glass partition, he
ordered the, patti tion. be::cpened and invited all the people
into the party, much to the surprise of those present.

As far as the Sportsman's Lodge and Hotel were
concerned, they did not hire any security guards for this
occasion and as far as she knew the KENNEDY party had not
hired any outside guards, at least she had not been so advised.

country and was expected back sometime the coming week. FLOOD
said he was present when JERRY LEWIS had, on June 5, 1968,

associated with JERRY LEWIS in a film. In substance, FRANK
CULLEN had claimed. that he had seen the suspect, identified
in the papers and on television as SIRHAN SIRHAN, on an elevator
with Senator KENNEDY sometime during the latter's campaign in
California. No further details were given by CULLEN to LEWIS,
further that LEWIS had remarked he did not know FRANK CULLEN
or vouch for the veracity of CULLEN's story.

at $250 per plate, which was held at the Sportsman's Lodge, during
the latter part of March 1968, attended by Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY. FLOOD said he was not acquainted with anyone by the

RATHBURN advised that on June 9, 1968, he was
loaned by Metropolitan Division to Rampart Division
Detectives and he received a phone call from Sergeant TREVIS
of the Santa Monica, California Police Department. TREVIS
advised that he had information that a person on a certain
airplane flight had something to do with the KENNEDY
assassination. RATHBURN said he got the impression from
TREVIS that the latter was holding up the flight at the
airport. RATHBURN advised that he turned the call over to
Sergeant JORDAN of the Rampart Division. RATHBURN advised
that later Sergeant JORDAN said that TREVIS was at
International Airport, Los Angeles, where he was checking
on a certain flight to New York concerning a passenger,
TAMARA COROVICH. TREVIS had said that he had received
information that COROVICH had something to do with the
KENNEDY assassination. TREVIS had said that this information

DEEMS said she worked at a boutique shop in the
Miramar Hotel, Santa Monica, California. She said that a guest
in the hotel had ordered panty hose by phone and DEEMS
had asked the female caller how tall she was so as to get
the right size. The caller said she was five feet six
inches. The vemale requested that the hose be sent to her
room, Number 236. A bell-boy took the, panty hose to the room
and returned to the boutique shop with the money, saying that
the female had paid through the door and all he saw was an

. arm.

DEEMS said that a bell-boy, possibly the same one
according to RATHBURN, had picked up a wig at Room 236 and
had taken it out to be styled. The female in the room had
provided a sketch as to how she wanted the wig styled. The
style covered a portion of her face and DEEMS thought that
sending out the wig to be styled was an unusual occurrence.

DEEMS talked to a friend of hers named PETER
KALVADA, a room-clerk at.the Miramar Hotel, about the person
occupying Room 236. KALVADA told her that MARGARET PETTY
(phonetic) was registered for that room and had checked in
June 5, 1968. DEEMS tried to see the actual time of registration
but did not get an adequate look at the registration card.
She determined that the registration for Room 236 was made
at either 1:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m.

DEEMS then talked to another beli-boy who said he
h@éd Deen delivering food to that person for about two weeks,
put that she had previously had another room. DEEMS then
asked KALVADA if the female was in another room before
‘ peing in Room 236. KALVADA said the female had not been in
another room. RATHBURN said that- thereupon DEEMS became
suspicious of KALVADA, whom she identified as a 23 year old
male from Czechoslovakia who speaks with an English accent.
DEEMS, who Kncws KALVADA well, thought that the English ;
accent was unusual for a Czechoslovakian. She said KALVADA
was supposed to have escaped fem Czechoslovakia. RATHBURN
said he understood, from DEEMS, that KALVADA had escaped from
behind the iron curtain.. : ; ;

said that PICASSO was a well-known communist. RATHBURN said
he understood from her talk that she was making reference to
the painter named PICASSO as being a well-known communist.

DEEMS said that someone had left a suitease in the
Miramar and the previous owner of the boutique shop had
obtained it, opened it and had seen some papers in it that
somehow indicated that a man had been in prison. She said
the suitcase had been turned over to the police. RATHBURN
said that he did not know where,on the Miramar premises, the
suitcase had been left; that he understood that the boutique
shop owner opened it as the person did not return for it.

DEEMS indicated that she was frightened to stay at
her home under the circumstances, so she went to the Jamaica
Bay Inn at Marina Del Rey, California.

KALVADA visited her at the Jamaica Bay Inn and she

wanted him to stay, but he said he could not do so as he had
to get up early in the morning. He told her that he was
going to help at "Exit" beer bar on Washington Boulevard in
Culver City. KADVADA said he was tired and wanted to borrow
the key to DEEMS! apartment at 852B lOth Street,
Santa Monica, where he wanted to spend the night. She did
give him the key and he left. DEEMS said to RATHBURN that
KALVADA was only 23 years old but tired; that when she was
that age, she could stay up several days and nights.

In a day or two, DEEMS checked up, maybe going to
the "Exit" beer bar, and apparently KALVADA had not been
there to work, as he had previously indicated to her.

Later DEEMS went to KALVADA's apartment, wherever

it was, and she found him unshaven and appearing as though’
he had been up all night. She wanted her key to her

apartment back but KALVADA told her that he did not have it
and possibly dropped it there on the apartment floor. This
was a key to DEEMS' apartment at 652B.10th Street,

Santa Monica.

DEEMS said that she went to her apartment getting
in with a key obtained from the manager of the apartment.
She then decided to stay and clean up the place. On the
bedroom floor, she found KALVADA's shirt and in the pocket
she found the apartment. key. She also found a receipt from
a cleaney in KALVADA's name,which she gave to RATHBURN. On
the back of the rec@ipt was a note reading "TAMARA COROVICH
Sunday 4:30 AAL 299". RATHBURN was of the belief that there
was additional matter on the back of the receipt, but said
he couid not recall its nature.

DEEMS said that she had the name of Police Officer
HILAIEL of the Santa Monica Police Department and had in the
past called him; that now, after finding the note, she tried
to call him but could not reach him. RATHBURN advised that
DEEMS apparently talked to someone else at the Santa Monica
Police Department. DEEMS said that after she got the note
naming TAMARA COROVICH, she checked with a friend of hers
at the Miramar Hotel, who worked for Western Air Lines,as
RATHBURN recalled. DEEMS got this person to check for the
name of TAMARA COROVICH on that flight and learned that
COROVICH was not on the flight as a passenger, employee,
or as a crew-member.

RATHBURN advised that DEEMS never said to him that
COROVICH was the "missing girl" in the KENNEDY assassination
case and she did not furnish further information regarding
COROVICH. RATHBURN said that DEEMS furnished no information
that gave appearance of tying into that case. He said that
DEEMS did not say that the information she was furnishing
did concern the assassination. She gave indication that she
regarded the information she was giving about KALVADA as unusual.
The way DEEMS spoke, she did not involve the leaving of the
suitcase,with the female who occupied the room at the Miramar
Hotel.

RATHBURN advised that while he and Officer PHILLIPS
were talking to DEEMS they were joined by Sergeant TREVIS
of the Santa Monica Police Department. TREVIS said that he
had been at the Los Angeles International Airport and,
as it was determined no one named TAMARA COROVICH was on the
flight, they tried to page her at JOHN F. KENNEDY Airport
in New "york City; that she had answered the page and the
Port Authority, there,was interviewing her.

RATHBURN advised that after the interview, he
telephoned American Airlines at Los Angeles International
Airport and got them to call their office in New York City
to find out if COROVICH had answered the page. A man at
the airport made the call and got a reply from New York City
which he gave to RATHBURN. RATHBURN said, however, that he
could not now recall what the reply was.

RATHBURN advised that DEEMS seemed "kooky" to him.
He advised that he and his partner, after the interview,
prepared the following hand printed police report:

Police Department (SMPD), advised that about 8:25 P.M., June 9,
1968, he was detailed by Lieutenant HAROLD TUCKER of the SMPD
to the Los Angeles International Airport, American Airlines,
Crew Schedule Office, to contact JOHN S. MCRGAN, Crew Schedule
Officer for American Airlines, regarding possible information
concerning the assassination of ROBERT KENNEDY that was
passed on to SMPD Detective HELAIEL on Thursday, - -
June 6, 1963.

TRIVES contacted JOHN MORGAN who related the foilowing:

About 7:40 P.M. on June 9, 1968, he received a
telephone call from a person who identified herself as VERONICA
DEEMS, telephone 323-3584. She stated that a person named
TAMARA COROVICH was aboard American Airlines Flight 4
destined for New York City, that COROVICH may have been connected
with the KENNEDY assassination. MORGAN stated that the only
description that he received was that the party was 5'64' tall.
DEEMS would not tell him the sex and implied the party was
employed by American Airlines. MORGAN immediately checked the
passenger reservation list for that particular flight and was
unable to locate the name COROVICH. He also checked the crew list
for that particular flight and was unable to locate the name
COROVICH

TRIVES advised that the flight involved was to leave
on the night of June $, 1968.

TRIVES said that he telephoned Lieutenant TUCKER to
obtain the address for the telephone number given oy. VERONICA
DEEMS. The address was that of CECIL STERLING, 13940 Tahiti Way,
Apartment 217, Marina Del Rey, California. Approximately 9:40 P.M,
TRIVES spoke to Sergeant RATHBURN of the Los Angeles, California
Police Department (LAPD), by telephone and advised RATHBURN of

immediately went to that address on Tahiti Way. In the meantime,
JACK OVERSTREET, Superintendent of Dispatch for American Airlines,
had contacted the Superintendent of Dispatch for American Airlines
at Kennedy Airport to advise him what was going on. OVERSTREET
advised TRIVES that the New York Port Authority and the FBI would
be standing by for additional information. TRIVES suggested to
OVERSTREET that, if TAMARA COROVICH was a true name and if she was
traveling under an assumed name, then she might respond to a page
given in her true name. OVERSTREET immed‘tately called New York
and suggested this action. About ten minutes later OVERSTREET
informed TRIVES that COROVICH was being detained by the FBI,
after having responded to the page. TRIVES said he immediately
relayed this information to the LAPD.

TRIVES said that then he went to the Tahiti Way address
where he was to meet Detective R. TAYLOR of the SMPD and interview
DEEMS regarding her contact with the SMPD (Detective HILAIEL).
Upon their arrival at Apartment 217, TAYLOR and TRIVES found LAPD
officers RATHBURN and PHILLIPS already interviewing DEEMS. TRIVES
and TAYLOR told RATHBURN that the FBI was detaining COROVICH in
New York and asked him if they might talk to DEEMS briefly to
ascertain how she obtained the name of Detective HILAIEL.

TRIVES said he interviewed DEEMS, who stated that she had
been employed at the Miramar Boutique Shop; that there had been a
theft report filed; that her employer had spoken highly of
Detective HILAIEL who was contacted regarding the theft. TRIVES
Said that DEEMS indicated she thought that HILAIEL, since he was
an Arab, would be the man to contact in this matter. TRIVES
said that DEEMS asked him if HILAIEL was an Arab. DEEMS said that
she had called HILAIEL on the previous Thursday and had reported
this information.

TRIVES said that Detective CULLUM of the LAPD called

and said that DEEMS had found the name, TAMARA COROVICH, in her
boyfriend's shirt pocket.

At 12:20 A.M., June 10, 1968, Sergeant RATHBURN of the
LAPD advised that they had completed the interview with DEEMS
and had come to the conclusion that this information had no
bearing on the KENNEDY assassination.

TRIVES said that it was the combined opinion of the
LAPD detectives that DEEMS was possibly ‘psycho’.

TRIVES advised that DEEMS had called American
Airlines at Los Angeles International Airport and JOHN MORGAN,
American Airlines Dispatch Officer told Lieutenant HAROLD TUCKER
of the SMPD that VERONICA DEEMS had called regarding a party
named TAMARA COROVICH who was on a flight to New York and who was
involved in the KENNEDY assassination.

TRIVES advised that after he had talked to DEEMS and
had returned to the SMPD, he telephoned her as he had been
unable to locate the theft report in SMPD files. MTRIVES said
that DEEMS reacted as though he was a stranger, although he had
only a short time before been introduced to her by LAPD
officers and had spoken to her. DEEMS hung up but shortly called
back and gave information pertaining to the theft. TRIVES said
that DEEMS indicated she had been disturbed by his previous
call to her and she rather chewed him out.

TRIVES said that he was not actually present when LAPD
officers were interviewing DEEMS.

ALLYN SMITH, Manager of the Miramar Hotel, Second
Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica, California,
advised that PETER KALVADA, 1241 2lst Street, Santa Monica,
telephone 395-9439, has been employed by the Miramar Hotel
for several months, then spent two months in Europe but re-
turned to his employ with the hotel in the Fall of 1967. He
continued to be employed until June 10, 1968, when he suddenly
left without personally advising the hotel. Previously he had
been punctual about advising the hotel of his availability.

SMITH advised that KALVADA is a white male, about
6 foot 1 inch, about 190 pounds, having »lond hair and believed
to have blue eyes. He knows Slavic languages including Russian
and is a very personable individual.

SMITH advised that someone had called, not KALVADA,
and it was indicated that KALVADA had gone to Seattle; that his
girl friend or his girl friend's mother was sick in Seattle.

SMITH advised that since KALVADA had left so suddenly,
there had been gossip, which was of a third hand nature, that
KALVADA might possibly be in jail; that he might have attended
a wild party at which there was marijuana. SMITH advised that he
had no specific information along these lines and that this was
all hearsay and guessing.

SMITH also advised that in making bank deposits for
the Miramar Hotel, KALVADA had been short some $40.00; that
this might have “due to a mistake". SMITH said that this was
a small matter and never resolved.

SMITH advised that twice in the last two years, KALVADA
cashed personal checks for about $20.00 at the Miramar Hotel, doing
so with the approval of manager SMITH. These checks were on a
California bank and were returned due to nonsufficient funds in the
bank. SMITH advised that in these instances, KALVADA immediately
made these checks good. SMITH said he knew of no additional
bad checks passed by KALVADA.

SMITH advised that he had telephoned Detective HILATEL
of the Santa Monica Police Department regarding the disappearance
of KALVADA from the Miramar Hotel. SMITH advised, however, that
there is absolutely no information to his knowledge, that would
involve KALVaDA in the KENNEDY assassination in any way.

Hotel in Santa Monica, California, and was also employed

as a cocktail waitress in the same hotel at that time. She
recalled that in the confusion in the aftermath of the slaying
of ROBERT F,. KENNEDY, public notices were put out regarding

a ‘missing girl". She stated that an appeal was made to

all citizens to report any information possibly connected
with the “missing girl".

In this connection, Miss DEEMS stated she noticed
three separate incidents, in no way connected with each other,
which she thought might be of value in locating the "missing
girl". These incidents were all reported by her to Detective
LLOYD HILAIEL of the Santa Monica, California, Police Depart-
ment,

She recounted these incidents as follows:
Incident No. 1

Miss DEEMS stated that a hotel guest at the Miramar
Hotel registered under the name of MARGARET &, PETTE, Manhatten,

1968, Miss DEEMS stated she had received information from
one of the hotel bellboys, PETER KALVODA, that this same |
woman had previously been a guest at the hotel for about two
weeks total, having stayed in another room as an unregistered
guest. Miss DEEMS stated that KALVODA told her that when food
and merchandise was ordered by PETTE from the hotel or the
Boutique Shop, PETTE would never show her face when the items
were delivered. She merely stuck her hand out the door to
receive the items. According to KALVODA, PETTH hecame a topic
of conversation among hotel employees who all noticed they
never saw PETTE's face during her two week stay at the hotel.

part of her face. Miss DEEMS stated she talked to PETTE on
the telephone and noticed PETTE's voice sounded like that
of a young woman with no accent. PETTE ordered panty.-hose -
from the Boutique Shop indicating her height was 5'6", The
registration card at the Miramar Hotel indicated PETTE left
the hotel on June 9, 1968. .

Miss DEEMS stated she reported PETTE only on the
basis that public reports indicated at that time the Los
Angeles Police Department was looking for an unknown woman
in connection with the shooting of ROBERT. KENNEDY, and she
had no reason to connect PETTE with that matter except
for the activities noted above,

Incident No. 2

Miss DEEMS stated that on June 3, 1968, .an unknown
male left a suitcase at the door cf the Miramar Hotel Beauty
Shop stating he would return for it later and asked attendants
to look after the suitcase. She stated no one came for the
suitcase as of June 7, 1968. She heard from beauty shop
employees that the suitcase contained mens clothing. She
understocd the matter was reported to authorities and two men,
believed to be FBI agents, took the suitcase away on June 7,
19868. She said she had no reason to believe this incident
was connected with the shooting of ROBERT KENNEDY.

Incident No. 3

PETER KALVODA, Supra, left some papers at Miss DEEMS
apartment, 852B Tenth Street, Santa Monica, California, on -
June 8, 1968. Among these papers Miss DEEMS stated she noticed
one piece of paper carried the notation, "TAMARA KOROVICH" and
thereafter followed a notation about departure on an American
Airlines flight scheduled to arrive at Kennedy Airport, New
York, about midnight. Miss DEEMS at this time stated she
believed the flight was for June 8 or 9, 1968. At that time
she stated she made inquiries through American Airlines in
Los Angeles and was unable to ascertain if TAMARA KOROVICH was
a passenger or a crew member aboard any American Airlines
flight that day. Miss DEEMS stated she knew of no reason why
PETER KALVODA would have the name of TAMARA KOROVICH in his
possession and the thought crossed her mind that KOROVICH
might be the "missing girl". She had this thought because

was not one of them. Miss DEEMS. said she tried to contact.
the FBI Office in Los Angeles but all of the lines were...
busy. Since the flight was already en route, she thought
she would save time and called the New York Office of the
FBI regarding TAMARA KOROVICH. Miss DEEMS stated she sub~_
sequently learned from KALVODA that TAMARA KOROVICH is a
stewardess with American Airlines. She is based in New
York and KALVODA met her casually at the Miramar Hotel in
Santa Monica, California, during one of her layovers. Miss

WILLIAM D. DABNEY, Stockbroker, Glore Forgan
William R. Staats, Inc., 221 Montgomery Street, San Francisco,
was interviewed concerning letters that he wrote to various:
businessmen in the Bay Area concerning Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY.

DABNEY said that he saw an advertisement in a
local paper wherein various businessmen campaigning for
Senator KENNEDY had placed this ad on behalf of the ;
"Businessmen for KENNEDY". He said that his political
views were different than that of Senator KENNEDY and these
businessmen but saw an opportunity perhaps to gain new
business as a stockbroker by writing these men a note. He
said that the notes were small handwritten notes on his
memo pad to which he attached his business card. He
recalls the notes saying something to the effect that it
was frightful that they were endorsing KENNEDY.

DABNEY stated that the notes were all written
prior to June 1 and he, of course, was not aware of any
of the events that were to take place in Los Angeles on
June 4, 1968. He said that he has no information at all
pertaining to the shooting of Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. GARSON said he recalled the evening of March 24,
1968, during an appearance of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
at the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel to give a campaign speech.
Mr. KENNEDY had arrived at the hotel around 7:00 P.M,
on March 24, 1968, and had been assigned Room 508. Mr.
GARSON, at the time, was working on the Zront desk in the
hotel lobby.

Mr. GARSON had, shortly after Mr. KENNEDY's
arrival, been asked to aid a Mr. FRANK CULLEN to act as
a security guard outside the room of Senator KENNEDY on
the fifth floor. Mr. GARSON's attention was called to a
young man who appeared on the fifth floor and wanted to
take a photograph of Senator KENNEDY, and when advised that
he would be unable to, he became very persistent.

Following attempts by Mr. CULLEN and Mr. GARSON
to get the young man to leave the fifth floor, Mr. GARSON
asked the young man if he were a guest at the hotel.

When the young man said no, Mr. GARSON advised him that

if he did not leave, the police would be called. The young
man then left the corridor, but was observed riding up and
down the elevator periodically, apparently checking to see
if Mr. KENNEDY was available for photographing. . The last
time Mr. GARSON saw the young man in question was approximately
one half hour later after first seeing him. The young man
at this time was standing in the lobby of the hotel near the
elevator and appeared to be with a young girl, They were
standing together and away from a crowd of people who had
gathered in the lobby waiting for Mr. KENNEDY to appear.

The young man in question had on one occasion
observed Senator KENNEDY on the fifth floor when the Senator
had appeared at the door of his room making inquiry about
certain cufflinks which had been misplaced.

One of the remarks made by the young man seeking
a photograph of Senator KENNEDY was "If I don't get him
now, I'll get him later," which Mr. GARSON felt had reference
to the taking of the photograph.

Mr. GARSON, who said he had never sean the young
man or the young woman before, described them as follows:

Sex Male

Race Caucasian

Age : Early 20's

Height 519"

Build Slender

Weight 140-150 pounds

Hair Dark brown, slightly
wavy, well combed

Clothing Wearing dark brown
suit and tie

Complexion Dark

Characteristics Possibly Italian or

Middle Mediterranean;
neat, clean cut;

very articulate;

In opinion of Mr. GARSON,
a young college student;

possibility that young

man wore eyeglasses
(although GARSON could not
be sure)

The young girl observed with
above young man:

No further description recalled.

Following an examination of a photograph of SIRHAN
SIRHAN and his brothers, Mr. GARSON said he had no recollection
of seeing these individuals before and had not believed any
had been the young man which he described above. The one
coming closest to the young man in question was a photograph
of MUNIR SITRHAN shown wearing glasses; however, in examining
another photograph of MUNIR without glasses, was of the opinion
that the young man was definitely not MUNIR.
