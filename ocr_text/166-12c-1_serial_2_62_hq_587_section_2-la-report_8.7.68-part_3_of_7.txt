current Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY, among others.

On May 20, 1963, he went to the Ambassador Hotel
to the KENNEDY rress rooms, and there was given,by a
KENNEDY aide, a PT 109 tie clasp. Later on that same day,
he, by chance, met Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY on the stairway

hitchhiked to the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where he went. to

the seventh floor and into a CBS television room where

MC CARTHY was to appear, He saw MC CARTHY, who autographed
the aforementioned book, and shortly thereafter he left and
went to the hotel lobby. From there, he hitchhiked a ride
with two young caucasian men and a blonde Caucasian girl

to the Ambassador Hotel. These persons, whom he has never
seen before or since, drove a Sprite automobile. He cannot
recall the color. Shortly prior to their arrival at the
Ambassador they heard on the radio that the Dodger baseball
game had just ended and that DON DRYSDALE had pitched his
sixth straight shut out. Upon arrival at the Ambassador,
they drove through the Ambassador driveway from Wilshire
Boulevard to west Eighth Street, pausing to look to their
left into the parking lot to the rear of the hotel. They
observed it was full, and the driver continued to West
Highth Street, where he turned right and attempted to enter
a parking lot on the northwest corner of West Eighth and the
next north-south street west of the hotel. The policeman
there notified them that that lot was a private lot but that
one could park on the street in the red zone. He, WAYNE,
left the car before it was parked and never did see the
persons in the Sprite again. He eventually went to the
main doors leading into the press room just down the hall
toward the lobby from the Embassy Room but was refused
entrance thereto. by a guard. He then walked from that
entrance to the press.room toward the Embassy Room and
turned right and through the two double doors which lead
into the kitchen corridor, where KENNEDY was eventually shot.
From this kitchen corridor, he entered the aforementioned
press room via the side door. In the press room he was given ;
by someone there,a blue and white rectangular badge which
had printed thereon, "KENNEDY Election Night Press," and
shortly thereafter, a woman gave him a green badge that had
printed thereon, "KENNEDY for President,” and in smaller
letters below that, "Press." He clipped the two badges
together with his tie clasp. He remained in the press room
about ten minutes, however, did not see anyone there that he
knew. He then left and went to the main lobby area, where
he saw an oriental girl with a number of KENNEDY posters. He
asked her for some, and she gave him two. He then proceeded
to the RAFFERTY headquarters in a room off the main lobby

and picked up several RAFFERTY buttons for his collection.

He went to the fifth floor of the hotel, where
he went into an open room which had a bar set up therein.
He drank a scotch and soda, which was free, and he stated
the room was rather crowded, however, not packed. He
recognized LES GOTMAN in the room, and they exchanged
greetings. He characterized GOTMAN as the youth coordinator
of the KENNEDY campaign and one who had maintained a desk
immediately to the right and in the corner as one would
enter the KENNEDY headquarters located on Wilshire Boulevard.
He also saw a KENNEDY staff member, whose name he does not
know, and they discussed the PI 109 tie clasp that WAYNE
had gotten from KENNEDY on the staircase. WAYNE explained
that he wanted to keep that tie clasp given him by KENNEDY,
and he asked the staff member if he could have another.
The staff member took the one he was wearing and gave it to
WAYNE. He, WAYNE, also observed, on the fifth floor,a 12 or
14 year old boy he had seen in the press room. Mr. KENNEDY
then emerged from his room on the fifth floor, along with the
rest of his party and proceeded toward the elevator. He,
WAYNE, recognized ROSIE GRIER, and he asked Mr. KENNEDY if
he would autograph the poster that he had. KENNEDY said he
would later, and he and his party entered one elevator while
WAYNE and members of the press entered the other. They
alighted from the elevator in the kitchen of the hotel and
all proceeded toward the corridor where KENNEDY was eventually
shot. In the corridor, WAYNE caught up to KENNEDY and
presented the poster, which was autographed by KENNEDY
(There is _a photograph of KENNEDY autographing the poster
on Page 76 of the special edition of Life magazine captioned,
"the Kennedys.") After signing the poster, KENNEDY and his
party entered the Embassy Room from the aforementioned
corridor, and he, WAYNE, remained in the corridor until
asked to leave by a woman wearing the red, white and blue
colors of the KENNEDY National Press Corps. He left via
the double doors at the end of the corridor next to the
press room, however, as soon as he saw the woman from the
National Press leave he re-entered the corridor. He does
not recall seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN in the corridor. Shortly
thereafter he departed again via the same double doors and
went into the Embassy Room where he heard KENNEDY finishing
his speech. Just prior to the end of the speech, he, WAYNE,

went through the same double doors again and into the kitchen
corridor near the press room. He did not see KENNEDY again.
He did observe, however, a group, which he knew was the
KENNEDY party, walking toward him from the far end of the
kitchen corridor. He remembers hearing some noises that

were not loud at about that time. He remembers hearing a

few noises and then shortly thereafter a number more. It

did not dawn on him at the time what was happening. He did
not see KENNEDY get shot or fall to the floor. He heard
voices shouting, "Oh, my God, he's been shot," and other

such cries, and then remembers seeing ROSIE GRIER and others
on top of a man on the chrome table to his front and left.
The man was swarthy in complexion, and he stated he was the
same man whom he has seen photographs of identified as SIRHAN.
He was very shocked and immediately ran into the press room
via the side door and picked up the phone and tried to dial
the operator, however, could not get the dial tone or anything
else. He tried it on several phones with the same results.
He then ran into the hallway in the front of the Embassy
Room and was asked by persons there what had happened. He
advised he could not say and continued to run, seeking a phone,
into the Gold Room, where he asked a busboy where a phone was,
The busboy did not know, and he ran out of the room and up to
a Negro Security Guard, and he asked him where a phone was.
The guard wanted to know why he wanted to phone, and he
replied that KENNEDY had just been shot, and he wanted to
summon aid, The guard appeared to WAYNE not to believe what
he had heard, and he handcuffed WAYNE and took him to some
security office in the hotel. WAYNE, at this point, was

very emotional and crying. The Security Guard advised him

of his legal rights, and he remained in the security office
about an hour, however, was allowed to get a drink of water
and call his mother and girl friend. He was then escorted
by two plainclothesmen from the hotel into the Gold Room,
where other witnesses were. He was released and went into
the next room, where the NBC television was, and ate some
rolls, drank cokes, etc. He was then taken to the Rampart
Station, Los Angeles Police Department in a police vehicle
with many other witnesses and remained there from about

1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., June 5, 1968. After giving his story
as a witness to the police, he was driven home by them in the
Los Angeles Police Department van.

He gave no indication whatever that he was displeased
with the fact that he had been detained at the hotel.

On June 4, 1968, at approximately 10:00 P.M. he went
to the Ambassador Hotel to participate in a rally for Senator
KENNEDY since he, WILLIAMS, is a member of an organization called
"New Images", which he described as a Negro organization formerly
dedicated to the support of Senator KENNEDY for the Democratic
Presidential nomination. At approximately midnight he heard the
Senator speak in the Embassy Room. Following the speech, he
observed that Senator KENNEDY was pressed by the large crowd as
he started to turn to his, KENNEDY's, right. The Senator then
turned to his left and proceeded behind the curtains at the rear
of the stage. A few minutes later he heard some rapid sounds which
sounded like balloons popping but which he later learned were
gun shots. He then observed a female Caucasian, who he later
learned was ELIZABETH EVANS, proceed from the direction of the
kitchen area of the ballroom with some blood on the side of her
head.

He stated that he was approximately in the center of the
ballroom when the shooting occurred and did not get any closer
to the scene due to the large number of people there. He did not
see anyone in a polka dot dress nor can he recall seeing SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN while at the hotel at any time. He advised that
BOOKER GRIFFEN, President of the "New Images" and publicity
director for the Negro Industrial Economic Union was on the
platform with Senator KENNEDY during the Senator's speech. He
also stated that GEORGE GREEN, Vice President of "New Images"
was also in the ballroom. He further recalls seeing WILLARD MURRAY,
Mayor YORTY's assistant in charge of liaison with the Los Angeles
Negro community, in the bailroom.

Mr. “SARL C, WILLIMAN, 3412 Helms Avenue, Culver City,
California, erployed as Assistant Chief Set Electrician,
Desilu Studies, and currently Vice President, Studio Electrical
Technicians, Gocal 728, International Alliance of Theatrical
Stage Employees and Motion Picture Machine Operators of the
United States: and Canada (IATSE), 1067 North Fairfax Avenue,
Los Angeles, California advised as follows:

Regresentatives of Local 728 attended a breakfast
meeting with Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY at the Ambassador Hotel
on June 1, 1968. WILLIMAN subsequently prepared a letter
advising the Senator that the union would support him in
seeking the Democratic nomination. WILLIMAN completed the letter
on the evening of June 4, 1968, and left his home to mail the
letter. En route to the post office, he decided to continue
to the Ambassador Hotel and deliver the letter to the Senator
or to one of his associates. WILLIMAN arrived at the hotel
sometime after 10:30 PM, and proceeded to the press room. In
the press room, he met the actor, MILTON BERLE, with whom he
is acquainted, and gave the letter to BERLE for delivery to
Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. WILLIMAN then decided to remain at
the hotel to witness the activity there. He primarily located
himself in an ante room directly behind the speaker's rostrum
of the Embassy Room. Senator ROBERT KENNEDY passed by WILLIMAN
to arrive at the rostrum and passed directly by him as he
departed the rostrum.

WILLIMAN further described this area by saying
that an ABC monitoring television set was located in the area
and two men from ABC were near the monitor who apparently had
something to do with the news coverage of the event. A third
man Was also in the area who was apparently of Latin-American
extraction in that he had dark skin and black, bushy hair.
This man was well-dressed and wore a polka dot necktie. He
was about 50 years of age and was about 6 feet tall. He was
stocky, and had a fat round face, This man sat in a chair
in this area during the time WILLIMAN observed him.

WILLIMAN noted that two women also were in this area.

Both women were white. One was rather young, was fairly
attractive and had light hair. She wore a beige dress, This
girl seemed interested in WILLIMAN, asked what he was doing
in the room and wrote his name down. The other was about

30 - 32 years of age, had dark hair, and wore a short black
dress. Subsequent to the shooting, WILLIMAN observed that
this second woman was interviewed on one of the television
networks.

WILLIMAN did not learn the names of the above-
mentioned individuals, and he could furnish no additional
descriptive information concerning them.

Upon completion of his speech, Senator KENNEDY
departed the rostrum and came into the area occupied by
WILLIMAN, KENNEDY was accompanied by a large group of people
who swept through this area and into the corridor beyond.
WILLIMAN stayed back and watched KENNEDY and the group pass
by. WILLIMAN then recalls hearing two shots, and he rushed
into the corridor to see what was happening. He noted that
aman was on the floor, and then observed an individual with
a gun was struggling with ROOSEVELT GRIER and some other
people. This individual still had the gun in his hand and
GRIER and the others were attempting to obtain possession
of the gun. WILLIMAN assisted in the struggle. While
struggling with the assailant, WILLIMAN noted that Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY was also on the floor of the corridor.

In the course of the struggle, WILLIMAN observed that
the assailant's arm and hand was being bent over a table or
ledge which ran along the side of the corridor. WILLIMAN
climbed upon the table or ledge and attempted to kick the gun
from the assailant's hand, WILLIMAN noted that RAFER JOHNSON
came to assist in controlling the assailant. After the assailant
was controlled, JESS UNRUH attempted to control some of the
erowd and keep the crowd away from the area.

TA 56-156

WILLIMAN noted that a hotel bus boy also was in
“the group attempting to subdue the assailant, and WILLIMAN
asked that he obtain a rope or cord to restrain the assailant.
This employee obtained a electric light cord or something
similar, but either ROOSEVELT GRIER or RAFER JOHNSON said they
should not tie up the assailant but should hold him physically
for the police. WILLIMAN then assisted in holding the
assailant until the police arrived and took custody of him.

WILLIMAN said he did not get a good look at the
assailant and mostly observed only the back of the assailant's
head in the struggle and in holding him. WILLIMAN said,
however, he could identify the assailant as being identical
with SIRHAN SIRHAN from photographs which appeared in various
news media following the assault.

WILLIMAN said he did not see SIRHAN prior to the
shooting and did not witness the actual shooting. Following
the shooting, WILLIMAN went to the Rampart Division of the
Los Angeles Police Department where he related his observations
in a taped interview.

WILLIMAN said SIRHAN put up a super human struggie
to maintain possession of the gun and to escape from the grasp
of his restrainers. WILLIMAN said that although he did not
observe SIRHAN's face and expression, he received the impression
that STRHAN was not mentally berserk and apparently was in
possession of his faculties.

WILLIMAN additionally noted that in the event someone
describes him as being involved in the struggle, that he is
52 years of age, 5'53" tall, 162 pounds, brown-greying hair,
with brown horn-rimmed glasses. WILLIMAN said he was wearing
a maroon sport coat, black slacks, white shirt, dark tie, and
cordovan shoes.

was advised of the nature of the inquiry by SA WILLIAM D.
HOSKINS. He advised as follows:

On the night of June 4, 1968, he, LLOYD B. WILKINS,
and ENNIS WHALEY, went to the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles,
arriving around 10:00 p.m., to attend the Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY victory celebration. He said his group went directly
to the Embassy Room where the victory speech was scheduled
but were unable to get in as the hotel security guards would
not admit anyone without a "press pass". He said they proceeded
directly to the Ambassador Ballroom where they remained for
the entire evening watching the proceeding on television
monitors.

He recalled his first knowledge of KENNEDY being
shot was when someone came into the room and said to switch
the monitor to channel 2 as KENNEDY had been shot. He said
he remained in the Ambassador Ballroom as there were so many
excited people running around he felt it was wiser to remain
where he was rather than try to go to the scene of the shooting.

He said he had seen numerous pictures of SIRHAN
SIRHAN in the papers and on television but does not recall
seeing him during his stay at the Ambassador Hotel.

He said he was unable to furnish any additional
information.

employed as the Senior Correspondent by Newhouse National
News Service, Washington, D. C, He related he followed the
ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign both in Oregon and California.
WITCOVER related he was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles, California on the night of June 4 - 53 1968, when
ROBERT F, KENNEDY was assassinated,

f

WITCOVER informed that he had congratulated
him on his victory when he came into the area of the .
hotel where he was located and had followed KWNNEDY to the
platform in the Embassy Room of the hotel. When KENNEDY
finished speaking,he passed through the corridor the same
way that KENNEDY had come into the Embassy Room. FRED DUTTON
or RICHARD GRAHAM, aides to KENNEDY, had advised him that ;
a press conference was to be held immediately after in the
Colonial Room and thus’ he presumed that KENNEDY would be
going to the Colonial Room via the kitchen, throvgh which
he had come to enter the Embassy Room. WITCOVER stated
that access to the Colonial Room and the Embassy Room
could be gotten by going through the kitchen, WITCOVER
stated that.when KENNEDY left the platform in the Embassy
Room he was approximately thirty feet ahead of KENNEDY going
down the corridoy which was ten to twelve feet wide and he
noted that two women were sitting in this corridor... They
were sitting in chairs on ‘the right side. He believed these
women were with the KENNEDY party and possibly wives of some
of the aides and he based this upon the fact that they were
very casvally dressed and definitely not actively working
for the KENNEDY campaign as they were not visibly excited
at the particular time. WITCOVER stated he then came to a
passage way about six feet wide. At no time did he-see
anyone other than these two women in. the corridor. He stated
he had almost reached the doors into the kitchen when he
heard a shot.. He first was unimpressed and:thought it was
a firecracker and then he heard rapid firing, at least four
or five shots. He informed he could not be positive that there

were four or five shots, or more. He informed that there was
a definite pause between the first shot and the subsequent
shots, WITCOVER stated that he turned around and first noted
ROOSEVELT GRYER and others whom he did.not immediately
identify. He advised he did not notice the suspect immediately
as there was alot of pushing in one area. He did notice
an individual with his hand in the air and there was a gun

this hand. He advised he is not certain at this time
in which hand the gun was but he believed it was in the right
hand,

WITCOVER informed that he did not see KENNEDY on
the floor immediately ag there were three or four people
around him, He stated there was no crowd at that particular
time. He advised that he noticed blood on KENNEDY's head
and his hand and that his mouth and eyes were open... He
thought that KENNEDY had been shot in the head and. stomach,
inasmuch as the hand on his stomach had blood on it. © He
noticed that KENNEDY at this point was still alive.. :

WITCOVER informed that he then turned around and
noted a scuffle was continuing with the suspect and now
ROOSEVELT GRESR ana RAFES& JOHNSON and others were holding
the.suspect, Present. at this point were yells," Get the
gun, kill him, don't kill him ," and the scene was complete
pandemonium.

He informed that there were no’police or doctors
for approximately fifteen minutes and it was his thought
that it took approximately five minutes to get the gun from
the suspect, .

He noticed that GRESR had a headlock on the suspect
and that they had finally § suceseded in removing the suspect
down the corridor away from KENNEDY, :

He related that photographers were all around
KENNEDY at this time taking photographs and finally the
aides came and pushed the photographers .out of the way,

however, the photographers continued to take photographs.
Mrs, ROBERT F, KENNEDY came several minutes later, knelt
down beside her husband and said something to him. or was
praying. She finally got up and asked the photographers

to leave and then knelt back down by her husband. Shortly
thereafter, a security police came, took his gun out and .
then WILLTAM BARRY, an aide to the KENNEDY campaign, told
this man to put his gun away. This man then went to the
area where the suspect was. Finally, about one half dozen
Los Angeles police officers came into the area and relieved
GREER of the suspect and took him away. Shortly thereafter,
an attendant came, placed KENNEDY on a stretcher, and he
was taken out of the area and put into an ambulance.
WILLIAM BARRY and Mrs, KENNEDY accompanied KENNEDY in

the ambulance, :

WITCOVER informed that after KENNEDY was taken
out, he stood in the room, observed the room, and went
to the press reom to write his story. ;

they had moved the suspect down to the end of the table,
and heard the suspect say, "My leg, my leg, "

He described the gun as beingasnubnose revolver.

WITCOVER stated that he did not see anyone else
on the floor initially, however, all attention was focused
on KENNEDY, but then noticed another individual on the
floor who was wearing a press badge. He later found out
that this person was PAUL SCHRADE.

WITCOVER stated in reconstructing the matter that
when he left the platform he had a clear passage way before
him although there were two women sitting in chairs on the
right side of the corridor and when he turned around, he also
had a clear passage back to the group of individuals. He
stated he believed he was immediately ahead of KENNEDY when —
proceeding through the corridor. He stated that he was
concerned with getting to the Colonial Room which was to be
used for the press conrerence inasmuch as he was interested .
in getting the best possible "story.

SIRHAN'S FATHER IN AMMAN: A TALK TO "AD DIFAA" AT MIDNIGHT

At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, ad-Difaa learned that Mr. Bishara Sirhan, father of
Sirhan Sirhan, accused of assassinating Senator Robert Kennedy, arrived in
Amman from the West Bank on a permit issued by the occupation authorities.
It is said that lr, Sirhan has. come to Amman to clear up certain financial

‘matters in preparation for his departure for America. Until 10:00 p.m.

ad-Difaa searched high and low for him. In what hotel was he staying? In
Whose house was he-a guest? At last, we found him at the Hotel Continental.
Our reporter, Salah Abd as-Samad, who spent over two hours with Mr. Bishara
Sirhan, wrote the following interview. a

Bishara Sirhan was sitting calmly and talking confidently. You could detect
in his tone parental emotions. The 52-year old man said, "The murder of
Senator Kennedy saddened me because he was from the Kennedy family, but the
picture has a second face..."

Which..."

"The political face..for the Senator was also an American politician, so on
this I have a view to express." :

"Please..."

"I believe that the imbalance in Senator Kennedy's speeches while electioneerins
for the Presidency was the primary cause of what happened."

"How. .?"

"He was promising certain parties to supply them with arms and aircraft with
full awareness of the consequences of that promise. Its consequences would
be more displacement of children, more orphans and more widows, This is in
addition to the degradation of and contempt for the Arabs in his speeches, a
thing that made my son Sirhan feel insulted in that society where Senator
Kennedy was speaking. And this is what pushed my son to act as he did. Had
the late Senator been reserved and merely called for peace in the Middle East,
nothing would have happened."

"Are you furious with Sirhan?"
"In the first moments after I learned of the incident I was furious.".
"And now?! :

"My heart and mind are now with him. I believe that world opinion and human
conscience will stand by him."

"Why?"

"Because he is a man of good character by the testimony of his university
teachers and friends.’ He is also a fervent Arab in every crop of his blood."
"What was the position of the Israeli authorities toward you?"

"At 4:30 a.m, of the day following the news, an Israeli military car parked
in front of my house. I was then taken to the Military Governor's office

in Ramallah. An Israeli officer asked about my life, that of Sirhan, and
the family..." . . .

"And the Israeli intelligence agency?"

"It also interrogated me and wrote down information sinilar to that which I
gave at the Governor's office."

"And what is the latest news about Sirhan?"

"I learned that he told the investigators he refuses to be tried in the USA,
and wants to be tried elsewhere."

"What is his pretext for that?"
"He is not American, I am not either, None of my sons got naturalized."

"What else?"

"Two Lebanese lawyers and a Swedish lawyer have volunteered to defend my son."
“What do you imagine will be the sentence against Sirhan?" ;

"I believe there are in the world people of free conscience. I believe world
public opinion will be on my son's side because Sirhan was a model boy and did
not commit his action except to prevent further tragedy and further dis-
placement of children from their homes. Sirhan imagined that Senator Kennedy
would add to those tragedies. For all that, I hope that people of conscience
in the whole world will stand by my son." :

"I only wish the Los Angeles Court, and the American people and members of
the Kennedy family would imitate me..."

"In what?"

"In my toleration. My son Munir was killed in Jerusalem in 1946 after a cer
ran over him, But I pardoned the culprit and gave up my rights, even the
amount given to me as compensation, 500 dinars, I.dorated it to mosques and
churches and to the poor, I only hope that toleration will be cbserved by
all during the trial. of Sirhan."

"Did you do anything to explain your views in defense of Sirhan?"

"Yes, I sent appeals to President Johnson, the Pope and to U Thant. I
appealed to them to work for peace in the Middle East and Vietnam so that the
tragedy of Sirhan and Robert Kennedy would not be repeated."

"When do you leave for America to attend the trial?"

"T am studying the matter from all angles, including the financial one and
the question of my safety while there," .

"That means you are afraid?"
"No. I am not afraid. The matter really requires careful study."
"Your style of talking indicates you are a lawyer?"

"I am a mechanic. The credit for that belongs to the holy books: the Quran,
the New Testament and the Old Testament. I studied them all and have them
in my house side by side."

"And if I request you to offer a last opinion in this interview...?"

"I say I hope the Arabs will unite."

Excerpts from ad-Dustour's Interview with Sirhan . ; j

(1) "Bishara Sirhan, 52, is the father of five children and was in charge of
a water section under the British Mandate Goverrment in Palestine until 198.

’ He then came to Amman and worked on various water and mechanics projects
until 1957 when he emigrated to the United States with his five children,
Sharif, Sa'dallah, Adel, Sirhan, and Munir. Three years ago, he returned
alone to his native tom, Tayybeh, in the Ramallah area." .

(2) "At dawn on June sixth while still asleep, I felt heavy footsteps on
the stairs of my house. I awoke and heard the 'moukhtar! (elder) of the
village, Fayez Ma'addi, knocking and saying, 'Open the door, Abu Sharif.
Don't be afraid. It's Fayez.' I opened the door and Fayez entered with two
Israeli soldiers and three civilians, one of whom began to question me in
English, which I know well, about my identity and the history of my family
and my son, Sirhan, I asked, 'why all these questions?! He answered that
.he was a correspondent of the NEW YORK TIMES and said, 'Did you hear about
Robert Kennedy?! 'Yes,' I said, 'yesterday I heard that someone fired at
him in Les Angeles.’ The reporter then said, 'Didn't you know it was your
son Sirhan who shot him?' I said, 'What do you say? My son killed Kennedy?

I think that most unlikely.' When he affirmed the news to me, it was a
violent shock. I was furious and sad, The reporter asked, 'what is your
opinion on the matter? Do you know anything?' I answered, 'here I am
asleep in Tayybeh, a village over 12,000 miles from Los Angeles. Of course
I do not know anything. It is an unpleasant, stunning, shocking surprise.!
The reporter asked, 'what is your feeling?' I replied, 'If the report is
correct, I am sorry for Kennedy and deeply regret the incident and am grieved
that this has happened to my son, '" ; \

(3) “As.I said before, there is no enmity between the Kennedy and Sirhan
families. I want both Arab and American opinion to listen to this statement.
Senator Kenned} had two personalities: first, he was a member of the t
American Kennedy family; second, he was a great American statesman. On the :
personal level, I am grieved by his death and shall continue to be so. As

for Robert Kennedy the politician, that is a different matter. He stated

time after time that he wanted certain nations to get stronger and certain 1
nations to get weaker. This, in my opinion, was a great error. I believe '
thoughtful men all over the world will agree. As a statesman, Kennedy i
ought to have been balanced in his statements end speeches and ought to i
have avoided saying things liable to kindle hatred in the Middle East. :
As a statesman he ought to have supported peace, right and justice in the : -
Middle East without favoring Israel."

(k) ‘Z still believe my son is innocent despite the accusations, But
even is we suppose he did it, we must examine the motives and reasons
that led him to such an act. His love for his homeland and religion must
: have overcome eveything else and incited him to act. I do not support
4 violence or political assassination. But Kennedy was rash in his statements,
. I say also that the conscience of America, and its courts, and world public
opinion will stani by Sirhan."

a (5) "Sirhan has seen destruction and: death in his om country, which last
' suffered war in 1967. In spite of the fact that Sirhan left for America in
i 1957, and Lived over ten years in American society, his religion and
homeland were constantly on his mind. The late Senator Kennedy was the
man who Lit the fuse of the mine inside my son Sirhan."
(6) "What is the program of your visit to Jordan?"
"I arrived in Amman today with a one week permit. I want to see. to my
account in Intra Bank, where I had some money before Jur une 1967. After that _
I will return to Tayybeh." .

"Do you want to go to the United States?"

vq am considering the matter in detail. I intend to hire. lawyers to
; ~ defend my son, but have not yet decided whether I personally will go to
' America to be with Sirhan during his trial."
