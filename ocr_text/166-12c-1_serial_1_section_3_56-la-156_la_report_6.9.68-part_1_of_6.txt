was no record of extra-curricular clups or other activities

record reflected he had interviewed SETRHAN on one occasion
in May 1965 because of his lack of regular attendance and
failure to appear at physical educatipn classes; however,
he could not recall SIRHAN at all due;to the large number of
students he interviews on a regular basis. Dr. LEWIS had no
record of any teachers or students whd might be acquainted
with STRHAN.

He stated there was no club on the campus composed
of Arab students or those of Arab origin, to his knowledge.

broad spectrum of foreign nationalities and the study of
any and all foreign cultures desired by the students. He
stated Miss JOSEPHINE NISSLEY, Associate Professor in the

JACK DAVIES, owner Jack Davies Richfield Service
Station, 2529 East Foothill Boulevard, Pasadena, California,
furnished the following information:

DAVIES advised that SIRHAN SIRHAN began working for
him at the station on September 28, 1964, and terminated this
employment on June 7, 1965. DAVIES advised that SIRHAN worked
at this same Richfield Station for one CLARENCE COPPING, who
had previously owned the service station prior to DAVIES
purchasing this station.

DAVIES advised that SIRHAN was an excellent worker
and never caused any trouble around the station, was friendly
to the customers, and seemed dedicated to his work.

DAVIES advised that during the time SIRHAN was
employed at his station, he worked the night shift alone and
was an excellent employee due to the fact that he was a loner
and never had any friends; therefore, there were never groups
of boys hanging around the service station while SIRHAN was on
duty. He advised that SIRHAN never made friends with anyone
at the service station and never expressed any of his political
views or nationalistic beliefs to him.

DAVIES advised that he never saw SIRHAN with any
girls and the only thing he recalls about SIRHAN was that he
enjoyed going to the horse races at Santa Anita and he always
got the impression that SIRHAN bet most of his salary on the
horses. He advised that SIRHAN once mentioned that he would
like to become a jockey and if he ever started any type of
conversation at the station, it was concerning horses that
were running at Santa Anita.

He advised that SIRHAN was very polite to the
customers, attentive, showed an outstanding personality, and
one of the best employees that has worked for him since he
took over the Richfield Station.

He advised that approximately two months ago, SIRHAN
came by his station on a Sunday and he helped SIRHAN tune up
his 1956 DeSoto. He advised at this time he noticed no change
in SIRHAN. He advised that during this time while SIRHAN was
at the station, no conversation developed other than SIRHAN
mentioned to him that his automobile had not been running for
the past couple of months and that he had not purchased license
plates for this automobile and that license plates currently
on the automobile belong to his brother.

DAVIES advised that he never met any of SIRHAN's
relatives nor at anytime while SIRHAN was employed by him did
any of his friends come to the station.

DAVIES advised that IVAN MILICIC, who runs the
Chevron Station across the street from his business, once
needed some help in 1965 and SIRHAN worked for MILICIC
approximately two weeks.

DAVIES advised that the last time he saw SIRHAN
was on June 3, 1968, at approximately 11:00 a.m. when SIRHAN
drove into his station to get gas. He advised that at this
time, he was talking on the telephone and he noticed that
SIRHAN had waved to him. He advised that SIRHAN waited on
himself by putting the gasoline into his car and gave the
money to SIDNEY MC DANIEL, an employee of the service station
and SIRHAN drove off before DAVIES could speak to him.

DAVIES advised that although several of his customers
may have known SIRHAN to see him, he is certain no one knew
him well. DAVIES advised that he did not notice any difference
in SIRHAN the past few months and he did not seem to change
any since he was employed at the Richfield Service Station.

DAVIES went on to say that when he saw the picture
of the suspected assassin of Senator KENNEDY on television,
he immediately identified this individual as SIRHAN, who was
employed by him and he further stated that it was hard for
him to believe that SIRHAN could do this type of thing.

DAVIES then furnished the following names of indi-

BERT ALTFILLISCH, manager and part owner of Granja
Vista Del Rio Farms at 13200 Citrus, Norco, California, advised
that his regular office manager and bookkeeper, who was off with
a broken dack, had observed on television the person accused of
shooting Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY in Los Angeles. Her had
contacted him and advised that this appeared to be a former
employee of theirs.

From his records, Mr. ALTFILLISCH was able to advise
that SIRHAN, with Teme to work
for this farm on June 2, 196, as an exercise boy with the
thoroughbred horses. He was laid off on December 10, 1966.
He gave his home address while working this six month period
as 696 East Howard, Pasadena. California. He gave his date of
aixth as 7 and his telephone number as SYcamore
-2136.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH was ale to advise from memory of
little contact with SIRHAN and, from comments made aiout him vy
other employees, that he was supposejto be a political science
student who had dropped out of school to try and become a jockey.
He had come to this country with his brother and mother, but
Mr. ALTFILLISCH did not know when. He seemed interested in
politics but did not espouse any particular ideology or ideas
that could be pinned to any political assaults or to any political
party of any kind. He was very adamant in his beliefs and was
dogmatic in his attitude in all things including politics and
including his desire to be a jockey.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH discharged SIRHAN after it was apparent
that he was not happy in his work and was not making much progress
towards becoming a jockey. The trainers and Mr. ALTFILLISCH
felt that he was too timid towards horses to ever become a good
jockey. He was also not looked upon with favor by Mr. ALTFILLISCH
since on one occasion he had attempted to organize the exercise
boys into going home at noon and doing only exercise voy work.

In other words, he did not like long hours of work and he felt
that he was above doing the groom work since he was hired as an
exercise boy. Mr. ALTFILLISCH was able to convince him and the
others that if they did not do their work as directed, they would

all be fired immediately. After this they all returned to work
including SIRHAN and no more was heard regarding this matter.

It is noted that this farm is a large thoroughbred
horse racing raising and training farm and as many as five to
ten exercise boys and girls are hired at one time. Mr. ALTFIILIISCH
said he did not recall exactly who SIRHAN resided with at the time
he was working at the farm. He believed he resided with one
SSSRRY M, WELCH and possibly with a RICK VALDIZ who is presently
at the Dscancio Farms near San Diego, California, and possibly
with STEVE GUERRERO,who he believes is working for RON MC MALLY
at the Santa Anita Race Track. He has no idea where TERRY M.
WELCH might be as he understood the Riverside Sheriff's Office
was seeking his whereabouts at one time. He advised that
STRHAN may have lived with these people and may not. He believes
he stayed Somewhere in the vicinity of Norco during the week
and traveled home to Pasadena on weekends. He was not particularly
close to anyone at the farms and did not form a buddy relationship
with any one particular person as is usually the habit of people
working in this type of work. Mr. ALTFILLISCH said the only person
working here at the present who would have had any contact with
SIRHAN would be GARY NORRIS, the present trainer. He advised
that GARY NORRIS took over the training work from one ROBERT
LYNN WHEELER, who is presently a trainer at the Santa Anita or
Hollywood Park Race Track.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH does not recall any mail coming in for
SIRHAN. He never heard of SIRHAN being a member of any type of
organization or attending any type meetings of any kind. He
again pointed out that he had a number of employees and they were
engaged in a busy type operation and although he had heard several
comments concerning SIRHAN he did not’ have personal contact
with him over a very few times.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH said that his records show that

te to6e. WELCH resided at 392 North Cota, Corona, California,
in 1966.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH advised that while employed here
SIRHAN was thrown from a horse on September 25, 1966. He
advised that this happenelin the morning hours and SIRHAN was
immediately taken to the Corona Community Hospital in Corona,
California. Mr. ALTFILLISCH made available copies of his
information furnished by the doctor, the insurance company and
his own report of this incident. He recalled that SIRHAN came
back to work within a very few days after this incident and
that he did not appear to be injured seriously. He was
scratched up considerably and was uncomfortable for a few days.
He worked for about two months after this and then later
brought an action to obtain money from the insurance company
for his injury.

Mr. ALTFILLISCH advised that during the summer, besides
TERRY WELCH he had employed at the time three local girls as
in the exercise area. One was PEGGY OSTERKAMP, the other was
LINDA SEABOLT and JANICE bucY.
