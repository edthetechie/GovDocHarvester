Bartolomeo (son of Countess

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2—
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan pleaded
not guilty today to murder in
{the June 5 slaying of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy.

A trial date of Nov. 1 was
set by Superior Judge Richard
Schauer.

Although Sirhan entered a
plea of innocence, it does not
necessarily mean he is deny-
ing his guilt. .

He is charged with murder,
‘with malice aforethought.

A guilty plea would have

been an admission of first-de-
gree murder—a wilful, delib-

erate and premeditated Killing,

The only way for a defend.
ant to have a determination
made of the degree df murder
—unless he specifically is
charged with second-degree or
manslaughter—Is: to be tried,
either by a jury or a Judge sit-
ting without a jury.

This apparently is what Sir-
han, in the face of seemingly
weighty eyewitness and cir-
cumstantial evidence against
him, did,

At a news conference that
followed the 24-year-old Jorda-
nian immigrant’s appearance
in court, Russell E. Parsons,

such a plea at a later time.

After the hearing, Mr. Parsons indicated he

“This defense will permit us to show the what

it? What prompted him? Why did he do it? Is he .
responsible?”

Califomia law defines first degree murder —
which carries the death penalty — as murder
committed ‘with malice aforethought."” If Mr.
Parsons can show the crime was not premeditat-

By Ralph Dighton

Ausociated Press

LOS ANGELES—Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan goes to trial
Tuesday on a charge of mur-
dering Sen. Robert F. Ken-
nedy—and a quirk in Cali-
fornia law could save him
from the gas chamber if he
is found guilty.

The quirk is a hair-split-
ting technicality, reinforced
by several decisions since
1949 but little known out-
side California, which recog-

| nizes'a person may be le-

gally sane yet still not fully
responsible for his actions.
A number of legal and psy-
chiatric authorities believe
the 24-year-old Jordanian’s
counsel might use a defense
‘wn as “diminished re-
sponsibility” to seek a ver-
diet short of first-degree
murder and a lesser penalty
than death, ‘

Presentation of ‘evidence
by bots sides is expected to
take two months or longer.
There are indications that
more than 200 witnesses will
be called. ;

_ Some are expected to say
that Sirhan waited in a
kitchen area of the Ambas-
sador Hotel early last June
5 as Kennedy announced to
a gathering of his support-
ers that he had won the Cal-
ifornia Democratic presiden-
tial primary.

Then, the prosecution will
attempt- to show, Sirhan

small-caliber pistol as Ken-
nedy and others passed by.

Kennedy and five bystand-
ers were wounded. The Sen-
ator died later in a hospital.

California Supreme Court
ruled that evidence illegally

defense arises from the fact
that the position has several
times won a reduced sen-
tence or even acquittal. In

evidence that the act was
not premeditated, which
would make it second-de-

five years to life in prison.

© The defense may try to
prove that Sirhan’s mental
capacity was diminished to a
point where he was not ca-
pable of malice. This would
be manslaughter, punishable
by up to 15 years in prison.

Diminished responsibility
has been claimed in several
cases when the defense
could not establish legal in-
sanity but could show the
person was influenced by
rage, fear, obsession, drugs
or even alcohol.

Sirhan pleaded not guilty
last Aug. 2.

Legal authorities pointed
out that the plea of inno-
cence did not necessarily
Mean Sirhan was denying
he killed Kennedy. Since he
is charged with murder with
malice forethought, the
“not guilty” plea could have
meant simply that he was
denying malice.

Parsons, at a news confer-
ence following the plea,
said:

“J haven't seen any evi-

He also said the not guilty
