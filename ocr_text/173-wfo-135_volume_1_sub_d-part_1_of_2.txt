5 Others Shot

In Los Angeles;
Suspect Held

By PAUL HOPE .
Star Staff Writer’

LOS ANGELES — Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was
shot in the head early today and remained “extreme
critical” after a team of six neurosurgeons remove

{ of a .22-caliber bullet from his brain in a thre
ne 40-minute operation at Good Samaritan Hospit

e.
The next 12 to 36 hours—that is, sometime be-
tween mid-morning today and tomorrow night—will
be “a very critical period,” Kennedy’s press secretary,
Frank Mankiewicz, announced after the senator was
transferred from the operating room to an intensive
care unit. ‘
Meanwhile, a young man held by police here as
the suspect in the shooting was identified as Sirhan

Bishara Sirhan, 23, of Pasadena, He was charged with |

six counts of assault with intent to commit murder.
The shootng took place in a kitchen of the Am-
bassador Hotel, a few minutes after Kennedy left
a celebration marking his victory in the California
emocratic preferential primary.
Kennedy's attacker also wounded at least five
ther persons. Among these was a Washington man!
iliam Weisel, associate director of the American
roadcasting Corp.’s Washington news bureau. Weisel
was reported to be in “good shape” after surgery.

Dr. Henry Cuneo of the University of Southern

who operated on Kennedy, was quoted today as|say-
ing that it was unlikely that the senator “will be,
able to recover fully... and (his condition) es
it doubtful that he could live.”

This remark, and other @ire conclusions sup-
osedly drawn by Cuneo, were. reported in an NBC
levision interview: by Dr. Lawrence Pool, who said

he had talked with'Cuneo. Pool is chief of neurosut-
Rerg-at-Columbla-Presbyterian Medical Center in New

Cuneo was quoted as saying that several major
arteties wete severed and Kénnedy’s brain suffered
extensive loss of blood and oxygen, as well as several

clots. He also sufferéd injuries to the spinal cord,
Dr. Pool said. :
: Pool himself concluded that “the outcome may
be extremely tragic.” He attributed this to the poten-
tial damage done to Kennedy’s “mid-brain” and the
“stem” that connects the brain “to all the rest of the
body” and influences such functiors as arm and leg
jovernent, eye and face movements, blood pressurg,

‘Washington Post Staff Writer
"G3 ANGELES, June 6—
Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, disre-
garding legal advice to cease
talking publicly about the
case, claimed today that Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy's assassin
had been a Communist sympa-
thizer and was inflamed by
Communist and pro-Arab agi-
tation. . ‘

“Evil Communist organiza-
tions played a part in inflam-
ming the assassination of Ken-
nedy," Yorty declared in a
press conference.

His publie statements today
and yesterday provoked rising
controversy and fears that his
comments would damage tlie
case against the 24-year-old
suspect, Sirhan B. Sirhan.

California Attorney General
Thomas Lynch cautioned
Yorty to limit the information

lease of such information
could be prejuditiaf and could
damage the case against Sir-
han.

In another development, po-
lice put out a bulletin seeking
information on a woman ina
white polka dot dress who, ac-
cording to a witness, left the
scene of Wednesday's shooting
shouting, “We shot him!”

One of Mr, Kennedy's cam-
paign workers, Sandy Serrano,
20, said she heard the cry and
asked who had been shot. “We
shot Kennedy,” she said the
woman called back,

|Wirin has interviewed him
twice in the Los Angeles
County jail while offering him

Police said Sirhan has ‘not
‘been traced to any subersive

Yorty also revived a promi-
nent local rumor in saying
that Sirhan’s car once was
spotted parked near a4 building
where the local W.E.B. DuBois
Club was holding a meeting.
The DuBois clubs have been
cited as subversive by the U.S.
Attorney General's office,

Yesterday, -Chief Reddin
said that a car to which Sir-
han once “had access” was
spotted near the building.on a
night when the club was meet-
jing. :

Yorty, under questioning by
reporters, agreed that it is not
known whether the car was
Sirhan’s. The Mayor had no
evidence that the suspect was
using the car that night or

Yorty said.

the search and said permission
bad been received from the
suspect’s brother, Abel.

Reddin has said yesterday
that a warrant would be ob-
tained in this extraordinary
ease, regardless of whether
permission was obtained in
advance.

Sirhan remained in the Los
Angeles County jail today. He
has been scheduled to appear
at a pre-trial hearing Monday
morning.

However, the County grand
jury has agreed to hear evi-
dence in the case Friday morn-
ing. District Attorney Evelle J,
Younger said he will seek a
‘murder indictment. He will
call 17 witnesses and present
“every bit of evidence on the
autopsy,” he said.

The suspect is being held
under $250,000 bond and is
being represented by a County
public defender, Richard
Buckley, The ACLU was mak-
ing arrangements to retain a
private attorney. The ACLU
also arranged police protec-
tion for Sirhan’s family.

Sirhan is being held in a
remote, windowless 9-by-12-
foot cell in the jail’s medical
ward. He is guarded coristant-
ly by six deputies -- one in
the cell, one watching through
a porthole, and four patrolling
the corridor outsid

Sheriff Peter Pitdpess said
eight to 12 telephoe callers
have threatened to kfil Sirhan
or his guards.

Sirhan is under treatment
for a broken left index finger

suffered, Pitchess said,in the
course of his arrest. He fs’un-
der care of Dr. Marcus Cra-|
han, the jail psychiatrist, who
“possibly” is. also giving him
psychiatric examinations, Pit-
chess said.

Sirhan, who was toll of
Kennedy’s death today, has ac-
eess to newspapers and books
and gets occasional exercise
in the corridor, accompanied
by two guards.

When Sirhan was arrested
he had $400 in his pocket and
a key to a Chrysler automo-
bile. Yorty has speculated this
suggests the suspect may have
been “thinking of leaving” the
Los Angeles area after the
shooting. There also was spec-
ulation the $400 may have been
a payment by someone else
for the shooting.

The indictment against
him is the more shattering
for its formality: that he did
murder “Robert Francis
Kennedy, a human being,”
and attempt to murder the
five other victims in that
hotel kitchen.

Case No A233421, the peo.
ple of the State of California
vs, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan,
‘is a very special ease,” said
the district attorney.

_ But is Sirhan a very spec-
jal person? Was it private an-
guish that moved him; and,
if so, what fed his hatred?
Or is he linked with the num-
berless groups of extremists
and fanatics in America or
the Middle East? .

Since the news reached
Israel at 8:30 p.m. on

Wednesday that the man ac. .

cused of the assassination
was Jerusalem-born, the Is-
raeli Secret Service has
been trying to discover if
any fanatical Arab under-
ground movement was be-
hind the. killing. So far,
agents have drawn a com-
plete blank.

Their main lead was Sir-
han’s father, Bishara Sala-
meh Sirhan, who lives in a
modest home at the village
of Taibeh, near Jerusalem,
When the father opened up,
he was asked first to identify
himself and then to answer
questions on his family and
Particularly his son Sirhan. :

“Why are you asking me ‘
about my son?” he.asked.

“You've heard the news
about Senator Kennedy?"

“Yes”

“Well, the man who is ac-

‘when the mother became -
strongly drawn*to" the Je- .
hovah’s Witnesses, A ver-
sion of events, given by peo-
le who know the family, is
that after the breakup, the
sect helped the mother to go
to America in 1957 with Sir-
han, two of his brothers and
his sister. ,

The father apparently
started divorce proceedings
through a Greek Orthodox
court, but stopped them
some months later and de-
elded to join. his family in
America. Other friends
claim that the passage, also,
was assisted by the Jehovah's
Witnesses.

The father’s present re:
lationship with the sect is
unclear. The Jehovah's Wit-
nesses have been banned in
dordan for nine years, but -
they still proselytise fierce-
ly. According to the Mukh-
tar of ‘Taibeh, the father is
supported by the sect—
though why, is unknown:

According to Mukhtar Mu’
addi, it was money from the
sect that helped the father
build his new ten-room stone
villa in Taibeh overlooking
groves of -almond and olive |
trees—a house that must
have cost around $12,000.

All this, the father denies,
But on the table in his sit-
ting room, he has a religious
tract in Arabic, “Solving
International Crisis,”
and: this is believed locally .
to be published by the Je.
hovah’s Witnesses. And in
his Bible he has marked in,

ho's to Choose Sirhan’s Lawyer?

Lbs Angeles, June 13 (UPI! — Sirhan B. Sirhan, awaiting trial jon
charges he assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, pored over books
on occultism in his heavily-guarded jail cell while outside cont#-
yersy swirled over who would represent him in eourt.

The 24 year-old native of Jordan was scheduled to enter a plea
June 28 in the courtroom of Superior Judge Arthur L. Alarcon to
charges he killed Sen. Kennedy and tried to kill five other persons.

Sirhan told A. L. Wirin, attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union, that he wanted two “big name” lawyers to defend him
rather than Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield, whom the court
appointed.

Mr. Wirin said “a number of. attorneys" had agreed to serve
without fee, but declined to name them. He also said Sirhan did not
want the services of famed attorneys, Melvin Belli and F. Lee
Bailey, neither of whom had volunteered.

The bearded ACLU attomey said Sirhan agreed to Jet the Los
Angeles County Bar Association’ select his attorney, but the Ba’
Association said it had nol agreed to do so and indicated it woul
ngt do so unless requested to. by the court.

Jr. Wirin also said Sirhan had asked him to serve as his. lawfer,
Bt lhe attorney said the ACLU’s interest in the case was only} i
sq that his constitutional righi to counsel was upheld.

Lee Harvey Oswald and Sir-

their apparent differences, are
brothers under the skin.

What matters more than
that one was born in New Or-

mired Russia, while the other
is fanatically pre-Arab—is
their underlying psychological
parallels.

heritage and education; they
are largely irrelevant. Focus

porary defection to Russia
where he married a Russian
girl.

Sirhan’s life story is a varia-
tion on the theme. His father
is still living, but is said te be
a volatile man who beat his
children when they were
small. He has been separated

from his family for many
years.
Mary Sirhan; the mother,

has managed to keep the chil-
dren together, but in pillar-
to-post cireumstances and an
atmosphere of religious fanati-
cism that has brewed -constant
discord. At least two of Sir-
han's brothers have been in
trouble with the law.

*

Furthermore, the crime of
which Sirhan is accused stems
almost inevitably from a tan-
gled network of causes. Yet
his mother claims he is ‘a
good boy” arid insists that if
he has changed, it is hecause
of having injured his head in a

~ fall from a horse.

Much has beet made of the
part rebellion against authori-
ty plays in assassination at-
tempts. On locking over the
evidence, the rebellion is of a
very special kind. John Fitz-
gerald Kennedy and his brath-
er, Robert Francis, were, as
président and presidential can-
didate, symbols of command
and power, Still, neither had a
style that was harsh or repres-
sive. Indeed, their identifica-
tion with the underprivileged
was a mainspring of their ap-
peal.

of all, I did not accept it as gospel. Secondly,

The mast that a colleague printed in the Washing-

predictions of 1968:

“I see a great burst around Sen. Robert Kennedy.
This could mean a great tragic — and planned —
accident.”

But privately she was more specific. She said he
would be killed.

In Miami around the middie of last January,
after making a speech at the Kentucky Fried Chicken
convention, Jeane took Col. Sanders, the founder of
the chicken firm; James Matthews, owner here of the
Tops Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants, and Frank
Callahan, the elderly Sanders’ traveling companion,

THERE CAN ‘RE NO LONGER any doubt about
the most sought-aftér ‘political song in this campaign
— “Will everyone here kindly step to the rear and Jet

a winner lead the way.”

Nelson Rockefeller wanted it but it is Hubert
Humphrey’s — signed, sealed and delivered.

If the songwriters and publisher had other ideas,
they have given them up. David Merrick has con-
firmed in writing what he told this columnist at a
White House party the first week in May. He wrote a
letter dated May 28 to the Humphrey headquarters
stating in no uncertain terms:

“You have my permission to use ‘Step to the
Rear’ for Mr. Humphrey’s campaign, and if there are

any claims of any kind from the composer, lyricist -

and-or agent, the E. H. Morris Publishing Co., I
hereby indemnify you against such claims, Good
luck.”? ‘

Merrick produced the musical, “How Now, Dow

Jones,’ in which the song was the biggest and best. -

thing in the show. And when David, who was a
lawyer before he became Broadway's most success-
ful producer, puts on a show he first acquires copy-
right ownership of the whole thing. In this case he
assigned only sheet music and record rights to the
Morris Publishing Co.

He has agreed to the song’s new campaign title,
“Let a Winner Lead the Way,” and to new sheet
music with the Humphrey lyrics. In fact, he has
given it carte blanche.

The lyrics sung here at the Humphrey birthday
party which were written by HHH volunteer Muriel
Nellis have been submitted, together with some
words written by the Vice President's daughter Nan-
cy Solomonson, ¢o original lyricist Carolyn Leigh for
editing, polishing or rewriting.

Although Morris had been quoted as expecting
thousands for the use of the song, Merrick told Mrs.
Nellis when he gave her his verbal okay in early May
not to worry about the Jost fee.

“Ag late as this morning,” he said, “we had a
very serious offer from the Rockefeller People, but
