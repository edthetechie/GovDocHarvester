SIRHAN United States History when he was in the llth grade
at John Muir High School, Pasadena, California in 1962.

RUSSELL stated he recalled SIRHAN well and considered him very
polite, reserved and sensitive. SIRHAN did ne have a
language problem. RUSSELL recalled no political or social
discussions with SIRHAN. He believed, but was not certain,
that there was a boy named TOM GOOD in the same class with
SIRHAN, however, he believed he recalled that GOOD and SIRHAN
were close friends. He stated GOOD was very anti-government
and the closest to being an anarchist in type of any boy of
chat age he had taught. GOOD's father was reportedly a dis-
abled civil service employee and TOM and his family were ap-
parently bitter as they felt his father had been cheated in his
settlement made with the government. GOOD did not like to abide
by the rules and was frequently in difficulty. RUSSELL re-
called GOOD's favorite autnors were ERIC FROMM and ALBERT
CAMUS, whom he believed was a French - Algerian writer of

a Revolutionary. type. He considered GOOD to have been un-
usually aware politically at that age and believed that if
GOOD had been a close friend he could have possibly influenced
SIRHAN in his political development.

Mr. RUSSELL stated he had not seen SIRHAN after teach-
ing him in the llth grade.

of business, the American Oil Station which he leases, located
at 797 East Mission Boulevard, Pomona, California, and
furnished the following information:

YOUNG advised, during the latter part of 1963
and the early part of 1964, exact month unknown, he was
employed by CLARENCE COPPING at the Elite Motor Service,
2529 East Foothill Boulevard, Pasadena, California. YOUNG
went on to say that, during 1964, CLARENCE COPPING sold the
Elite Motor Service to one JACK DAVIES, who operated this
business as the Jack Davies' Richfield Station and he was
also employed by DAVIES on a part-time basis during the
latter part of 1964. 7-1.

YOUNG advised that, while working for CLARENCE
COPPING and JACK DAVIES at the same place of business
located at 2529 East Foothill Boulevard, he first came into
contact with STRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. YOUNG advised that he
first met SIRHAN while working for CLARENCE COPPING. He
advised that, on one occasion, he worked with SIRHAN, the
reason being SIRHAN was to take over the night shift and
YOUNG's job was to break in SIRHAN on the night shift.
YOUNG advised that, on this occasion, he recalls SIRHAN telling
him that he was from Jordan and he asked SIRHAN if Jordan
was a good country to live in, and SIRHAN told him Jordan was
one of the best places in the world. He acvised that SIRHAN
then asked him what he thought about the United States and
he told STRHAN that the United States was no doubt the best
country in the world, and he recalls SIRHAN stating "Like
hell, it is". YOUNG advised that at this time he discontinued
his conversation with SIRHAN and they never had any further

friends and he never met any of his relatives or saw him
with any girls. He advised that, when SIRHAN was not
working, he would sometimes drop by the station but never
seemed to talk to anyone.

YOUNG further advised that during 1964 he can
recall that SIRHAN purchased a 1956 pink and white DeSoto,
name of the previous owner unknown, but believes SIRHAN
paid $150.00 for this automobile. YOUNG added that,
although he was not fond of SIRHAN because of the state-
ment he had made during their only discussion, he described
SIRHAN as having an excellent personality, a very good
worker, and any time he was told to do something at work he
always responded to it immediately. He advised that SIRHAN did
not seem to be a violent person and, when he was informed
by ROGER MOORE that the individual who shot Senator KENNEDY
was SIRHAN, it was hard for him to believe.

YOUNG added that he would not know of anyone who
would have been close to SIRHAN and the best way he could
describe him was as being a loner. He advised that the
last time he saw SIRHAN was during the first part of 1966
when he was at the Jack Davies' Richfield Station visiting
with JACK DAVIES and he recalls speaking to SIRHAN and
SIRHAN saying hello. He advised that SIRHAN at this time
did not seem to be any different from the last time he had
seen him and seemed to be the same quiet person.

Mrs. DONALD BOYKO (ELSIE) resides with her family
at 1545 East Mountain Avenue,, Pasadena, Galifornia. She is
e-years. of age. She is nominal “VPee President of NsB- .
Electronics Company, a firm which her husband previously owned
and now manages. Mrs. BOYKO was born in Lodi, California,
attended College of the Pacific and Walla Walla College in that
city. She is active in the affairs of the Seventh Day Adventist
Church, and has been a member of this church since childhood.
Mrs. BOYKO has lived at the above address for six years, and .
previously resided at 153 El Dorado Place in Arcadia, California.

In 1956, Mr. and Mrs. BOYKO met a Jordanian student
named ABDUL MJED DOBASS, a visitor to the United States who
was sponsored for study here by some neighbors. She had known
DOBASS as a student, but has not seen him duri the past four
or five years. He has remained in the United States, Se
married, and become a United States citizen. She does not know
his present whereabouts.

wee

Mrs. BOYKO first met SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN shortly
after Christmas of 1967, when she went to work as a saleslady
in a health foods store owned by JOHN WEIDNER at 1380 North
Lake Avenue in Pasadena. SIRHAN, whom she referred to as
SAUL, was already working in the store as stock clerk and
delivery boy. WEIDNER owns two other health food stores,
one in Monterey Park which is known as "Monterey Nutrition"
and another in Downey, California, on Florence Avenue (name
unrecalled). In addition to his duties as a store clerk,

SAUL would drive,: WEIDNER's station wagon to make deliveries
between the stores. She knew SIRHAN from December 1967 to
March 1968, when he left WEIDNER's employ because of daily
differences between them. When he was at the store, she would
talk to him during slack business times and found him to be a
serious, sensitive person and one with strong feelings. From
the beginning of their association, she made it clear that she
would not and could not discuss the politics of his country and

that of the Near Hast because she did not wish to and was not
sufficiently versed in this subject, but told him that she
would talk to him about religion and he very eagerly accepted
this arrangement. He told her that he was very much interested
in religion - all religions and was making a comparative study
of religicn. In this connection, Mrs. BOYKO said SIRHAN's
mother had been attending her church (Seventh Day Adventist)

in Pasadena for a couple of months prior to her meeting SIRHAN,
but she did not know her until some time later when SIRHAN
attended this church with his mother. He did not attend often,
perhaps three or four times, then dropped out. His mother
ceased attendance about a month after (February 1968). Mrs.
BOYKO has never met any other members of the SIRHAN family.

Mrs. BOYKO said she understood that during part of
the time that SIRHAN worked for WEIDNER, he took some religious
instruction from a relative of WEIDNER's who was living in
Pasadena at the time with his wife and was visiting the West Coast.
This person's name was PETERS, an older man who originally
came out to California from Wisconsin and has since returned.
The instruction Mr. PETERS gave to SIRHAN was in Bible Study.
Mr. PETERS is a minister in the Seventh Day Adventist Church
in Wisconsin (place unrecalled).

t% is Mrs. BOYKO's further reflection that Mr. PETERS
was highly incensed at JOHN WEIDNER's alleged harsh treatment
of SIRHAN. He > indicated to Mrs. BOYKO that WEIDNER's treat-
ment of SIRHAN was undoing any good effort he could make with the
boys from the standpoint of religious instruction

Mrs. BOYKO feels she had a good relationship with SIRHAN
and he seemed to like her. They talked of many things - nothing
of a serious nature - none of a political nature. Through these
conversations and other events that transpired in the store
(his relationship with WEIDNER), Mrs. BOYKO gained something of an
insight into his character. For example, she soon legmned that he
harbored a great envy for the good fortunes of others. He said
he did not like wealthy people. She cited as an example of his
dislike NELSON ROCKEFELLER who he said had too much wealth. He
did not mention ROBERT KENNEDY in this connection and never
mentioned his name to Mrs. BOYKO's knowledge. It was in this
connection - in his comments about wealth and his dislike for

-~ 521 -


--- Page 28 ---

LA 56-156
PIR/HMS

wealthy people-that he mentioned, inferentially, his dislike for
Jews. He did not mention these things with any discernible emotion,
but she remembers them from parts of his conversations.

SIRHAN's relationship with JOHN WEIDNER, in Mrs.
BOYKO's opinion, was never good, and as nearly as she and others
in the store could judge, SIRHAN was really not at fault in
this. WEIDNER is domineering, harsh and rude with his employees,
she said. He seemed particularly harsh with SIRHAN at times.
He insisted on strict compliance with his orders, i.e. "SAUL
come here at once!" STRHAN might have had a box of groceries
in his arms and would deposit them in a car or whatever before
complying. This would infuriate WEIDNER. He would regard this
as a challenge to his authority. He would berate SIRHAN and
accuse him of laziness and insubordination. SIRHAN would
defend himself shouting as loud "You just don't talk to me like
that" "You have to treat me like a man", and he would stand his
ground; then walk away in desperation and frustration. Mrs.
BOYKO tried to be the mediator, but the arguments and flashes of
temper on both sides became an almost daily occurrence. SIRHAN
wanted WEIDNER to fire him so he could get some severance pay,
but WEIDNER sensed this and would not fire him.

After these outbursts, SIRHAN would calm down and talk
to Mrs. BOYKO about his abiding interests. He indicated he was
interested in spiritual things. He definitely was interested
in horses. He spoke about his desire to be a jockey and talked
about his weight problems. He was also interested in the gambling
aspect. He went to the track frequently; every Saturday (at
Santa Anita) and apparently was a consistent loser. This bothered
him because he was interested in money and wanted money. He was
very conscious of his size. Being a little person, he felt dis-
advantaged. He felt this very strongly and had a defensive
complex about it. He felt it was a handicap, even though he
had aspirations to be a jockey.

He showed rv interest in,or interest in talking about,
girls. He indicated that dating girls was a waste of’ time, and
did not wish to discuss the subject. Mrs. BOYKO doubts that he
did date girls during this time. ‘

Finally.SIRHAN left the shep, sometime in March 1968,
and subsequently either sued or filed charges against WEIDNER
for back pay. Mrs. BOYKO does not know the particulars about
this.

Mrs. BOYKO said SIRHAN was strong in his beliefs -
strong in his convictions. With regard to other aspects of
his activity as known to her, Mrs. BOYKO said no one ever came
to the shop to visit him. He received no mail at the shop. He
received no telephone calls at the shop. He never waited on
customers except to carry groceries to waiting cars. He was
polite. He was respectful. He never expressed any strong
hatred even after his heated exchanges with WEIDNER.

He never came back to the store after he left and
Mrs. BOYKO last talked to him sometime in March.

He did complain about the poor condition of WEIDNER's
delivery station wagon.

Mrs. BOYKO said she has seen newspaper accounts
datelined Washington, D.C. which have quoted her as saying,
"STRHAN was a religious fanatic." Mrs. BOYKO said she never
said any such thing.

Mrs. BOYKO said the only Jordanians she has ever
met were ABDUL DOBASS (mentioned initially), SIRHAN and a local
barber named SIMON SHARU. Mrs. BOYKO recalls asking SIRHAN if he
knew DOBASS (above) and he acknowledged that he did, but said
no more, so that Mrs. BOYKO could not determine what the degree
of association was.

After the news of the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY and SIRHAN's picture was published in the
morning newspaper, all the persons at the store knew who it was,
but could not believe it. Mr. WEIDNER's reaction was electric.
He walked around the store beating his fists to his head saying,
"it's him, it's him - it's got to be him;" and then to a customer
who hed been friendly to SIRHAN in the past, he said "you see
Iwas right about him. I don't know why he didn't kill me -
he hated me so."

Mrs. BOYKO said she has no explanation for SIRHAN's
terrible act. She is shocked and unable to fit it with her
recollection of him. It is her opinion that she never did see

him except for some surface maniféstations, and these
were, to say the least, contradictory.

RETTA DRAKE 2516 Strathmore, Rosemead, California,
telephone 573-3897, advised that she was employed at the
Organic-Pasadena Health Food Store, 1380 North Lake Avenue,
Pasadena, California, as manager from December 15, 1967
until March 7, 1968,when she resigned. During this period
of time SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was also employed at this
store aS a general stock clerk and delivery boy. He had
been so employed both part time and full time since prior
to Mrs, DRAKE beginning her employment. She advised that
she did not know him and had never seen him prior to her
employment at this store.

Approximately one and one~half weeks prior to
her quitting on March 7, 1968, she submitted her letter of
resignation to the owner of the health food store, JOHN WEIDNER.
She advised that she left the employment at the above store
on the same date that SIRHAN was fired. On the morning of
March 7, 1968, she overheard WEIDNER tell SIRHAN that he may
leave the store, meaning that he was fired. SIRHAN then
proceeded to sit down in the store waiting to be paid his
wages due. Mrs. DRAKE said the situation at the store at
this time was tense after WEIDNER had fired SIRHAN, and to
ease this situation she made a statement to SIRHAN just in
general conversation. When she spoke to him WEIDNER then
came up to her and told her that she was not to speak to
SIRHAN since he was no longer working there. Mrs. DRAKE
advised that this infuriated her to the extent that she quit
her job on the spot.

WEIDNER eventually called the police on SIRHAN to
evict him from the store since SIRHAN would not leave until he

was paid.

WEIDNER refused to pay either SIRHAN or Mrs. DRAKE
and they both eventually filed claims for wages due before
the Industrial Relations Board. She advised that they did
not file these claims together but the cases were held
together on the same date before the Industrial Relations
Board, 107 South Broadway, Room 5015, Los Angeles, California,
on or about April 23, 1968. Her claim was eventually honored
but she has no idea whether SIRHAN received his money or not.

Mrs. DRAKE advised that she saw SIRHAN twice after

they terminated their employment at the health food store.

She once went over to his house to receive his help in filling
out her claim for wages due, and she met his mother. She also
saw SIRHAN on the date of his being fired from the health

food store in Katies Place Restaurant just down from the health
food store. She advised she was in there having coffee on this
date and he came in and joined her.

Mrs. DRAKE advised that she never saw SIRHAN either
before or after working hours while they were employed. The
last she saw of him was on the date that the claims were held
before the Industrial Relations Board.

In addition she did talk with him once or twice
over the telephone after leaving the health food store's
employment and prior to the claims being submitted before
the Industrial Relations Board.

She stated that SIRHAN never did talk very much
and what little conversation they did have at the store was
just general conversation. They never had any political
conversations and she cannot recall him talking of any of
his personal interests. On the one occasion that she was at
SIRHAN's house they talked only of Mr. WEIDNER and his health
food store.

Other than his mother, Mrs. DRAKE never met any
of his friends or relatives, and has no idea what he did
on his off hours. It was her understanding, however, that
SIRHAN was taking Bible lessons from Mr. WEIDNER's uncle.

She advised she has not seen nor heard from SIRHAN
since the claims were presented before the Industrial Relations
Board on April 23, 1968.

Her opinion of SIRHAN is that he was an extremely
nice person and that he did not seem bitter over being fired
by Mr, WEIDNER.

assumed he drank a little.

TERRY MICKEY WELCH, 25173 Farmbrook, Southfield,
advised that he recognized SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN from photo-
grapns on telecast concerning the attempt on the life of
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY. WELCH then called WWJ Television,
Detroit, Michigan, and mude them aware of the fact that he
knew SIRHAN and he was subsequently interviewed on that station.

WELCH stated that he first met SIRHAN approximately
three years ago when both were employed as exercise boys at
Granja Vista Del Rio, a thoroughbred horse farm located at
Corona, California, and owned by BURT ALTFILGISCH (Phonetic).
From that time until May 1967, WELCH was closely associated
with SIRHAN and considered him to be his closest friend. He
said that approximately 14 years ago, probably between Sep-
tember, 1966 and December 1966, SIRHAN suffered a very bad
fall from a horse at Granja Vista Del Rio and was admitted
to the hospital at Corona, where he remained in critical
condition for several weeks. He suffered head and back
injuries which resulted in his being partially blind in
his left eye and since the time of the accident, he has
su:fered from severe headaches. WELCH stated that SIRHAN
was supposed to get a settlement as a result of this acci-
dent and was angry because he did not get ag much as he
‘thought he should.

WELCH advised that SIRHAN underwent a complete
personality change after the above-described accisient. He
stated that prior to thet time, SIRHAN had been good natured
and easy to get along with. He was popular with other employees
at tne horse farm and with horse owners wno kept race horses
at this farm, WELCH listed DESI ARNEZ, BUDDY EBS@N, and DAL&
ROBERTSON, prominent television personalities, as horse owners
who were well acquainted with SIRHAN. He described SIRHAN
prior to the accident as well mannered, neat, clean, intel-
ligent, and a gentleman in every way. He said that while
SIRHAN was thrifty and would sometimes save his checks for
three or four weeks before cashing them, he was also generous

- in providing money to friends who were temporarily in need,

and in addition stated that although SIRHAN did not drink
himself, he accompanied WELCH and other employees to local
bars and would often purchase drinks for everyone present.

Following his fall from the horse in 1966, SIRHAN
became a "toner" who was resentful toward anyone who had
wealth. He, at this time, became unpredictable and unreliable
in that he would make plans to do things or go places with
WELCH and then for no apparent reason would change his mind.

After he was released from the hospital at Corona,
SIRHAN obtained a job with ROBERT WHEELER, an owner and
trainer at the Santa Anita Race Track. He remained on this
job for 3 to 5 weeks and when he found that he did not know
enough about the job, he quit and went back to Granja Vista
Del Rio to learn more about handling horses. WELCH said
SIRHAN had a great desire to be a good rider and although he
was frightened after the accident, he refused to quit riding
even after being repeatedly thrown from horses.

TERRY W:LCH advised that SIRHAN was also known as
Sol by race track acquaintances and fellow employees. He
said that inasmucn as persons of all nationalities frequent
race tracks and horse farms, he and SIRHAN worked with Mexicans,
Negroes, Irish, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Hungarians, and
SIRHAN never gave any indication to him of prejudice toward
any nationality. He said that before the accident SIRHAN was
curious and was always attempting to learn and improve himself.
He would visit dairy and poultry farms for example during his
off-duty hours, and could talk intelligently on almost any
subject. He spoke excellent English witn little or no accent.
He was an avid reader, particularly witn regard to law and
frequently discussed cases which he had read about. SIRHAN
did not appear to be particularly interested in politics and
WELCH does not recall any pertinent discussions of political
issues.

SIRHAN appeared to be devoted to his mother and told
WELCH he visited his mother in Pasadena, California, every other
weekend when he was not working. WELCH said he never went with
SIRHAN to visit his mother and does not know the names of any
of SIRHAN's relatives, but recalls SIRHAN stated his mother's
name was MARY. His father was overseas, according to SIRHAN,
and supposedly wealthy.

WELCH believes that the Reverend IFO HILL, Circle
City Beptist Church, Ninth and Sheridan, Corona, would possibly
know SIRHAN inasmuch as SIRHAN gave WELCH a card for this church
‘and suggested that he see Reverend HILL wnen he was having per-
sonal problems.

SIRHAN told WELCH on one occasion that he had been
expelled from a college in Los Angeles, California, as a result
of trouble with a girl. This incident supposedly occurred be-~
fore WELCH and SIRHAN became acquainted,

SITRHAN also, stated that at one time he had worked
for a gun or skeet club in. the Corona or Los Angeles area.
WELCH believed that BURT ALTFILLISCH would possibly have more
information concerning this. :

; TERRY WELCH gaid that when he first learned about
SIRHAN's connection with tne assault on Senator KENNEDY, he
could not believe that SIRHAN had shot KENNEDY because he

had previously been such a "nice guy". He has not seen or

had contact with SIRHAN since May 1967. He does not believe
that SIRHAN would have committed this assault for money, nor
_would he have been involved in a conspiracy. With regard to
the money allegedly in SIRHAN's possession when he wags cap-
tured, WELCH said it would not be unusual for SIRHAN to carry
large sums of money in his pocket inasmucn as he was a thrifty
individual and when he and WELCH were closely associated, SIRHAN
habitually kept his wallet in the glove compartment of his car,
which WELCH described as a 1950 or 1951 DeSoto. - WELCH said it
was common practice for race track employees to keep their
wallets in tne glove compartments of cars to prevent theft
from tnelr persons.

In conversations with fellow employees who were
refugees from communist countries, such as Cuba and Hungary,
SIRHAN always gave WELCH the impression that he was very much
opposed to communism, He indicated a liking for the United
States and never exhibited any particular loyalty or feeling
toward the country of his birth, Jordan. WELCH said he does
not recall having ever heard SIRHAN mention being or living
in any state other than California in the United States.

WELCH concluded by stating that he feels that the
personality change which took place in SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
after his accident must have gotten worse in the past year
since WELCH has had contact with him, and that he "went out
of his mind, or that something was preying on his mind."

WELCH said that SIRHAN was particularly friendly
with FRANK DONORAMA, one of the bosses or supervisors at
Granja Vista Del Rio, He added that prior to SERHAN's
accident, BURT ALTFILLISCH had been so impressed with SIRHAN's
- potential that he offered SIRHAN a good administrative
job at Granja Vista Del Rio. STRHAN declined this offer
inasmuch as he preferred to work directly with the horses
and become a good rider.

Mr. GORDON BOWSHER, Horse Owner and Trainer,
13505 Oaks, advised that SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN had been
employed by him from October 15, 1965, to March 31, 1966,
when he quit on his own volition. He stated he hired
SIRHAN as a stable hand at Santa Anita where SIRHAN walked
hot horses for him. After the Santa Anita season was over,
SIRHAN worked a little while for him at the Pomona Fair
Grounds. SYRHAN resided at 696 Zast Howard Street, Pasadena,

regarding SIRBAN was that he came from Jordan bic that he
had had no conversations with STAHAN and knew nothing
whatsoever regarding his background.

Mr. BUDDY EBSEN, television actor, was contacted
following an attempt to contact him through his agent, JAMES
MC HUGH, JR., 8455 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, California,
telephone number OL 1-2770. He was informed that an interview
was desired regarding any knowledge he may have of SIRHAN SIRHAN,
who had been accused of shooting Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.
SIRHAN reportedly had worked as an exercise boy at Granja Vista
Del Rio, Corona, California, a horse ranch where Mr. EBSEN was
said to have kept horses.

Mr. EBSEN said he could relate what information he
had inasmuch as he did not recall SIRHAN. ‘Two or three years
ago he stabled some horses at the above ranch, owned by BURT
ALTFILLISCH. His horses had been handled by FRANK DELMARA,
who was no longer employed at this ranch. BURT would probably
know FRANK's whereabouts. There were several apprentice boys
who handled EBSEN's horses whom FRANK would know or recall.

It was possible SIRHAN may have been at the ranch at that time.

On Sunday, June 9, 1968, Mr. EBSEN received a call
from GAYLE ROSENBERG, a representative of "Life" magazine,
seeking data and photographs of SIRHAN at the ranch as "Life"
was doing a story on SIRHAN. Mr. EBSEN checked through his
photographs taken of. his horses and came up with one showing
an exercise boy who could have been SIRHAN, but EBSEN was not
sure as only half of this boy's face showed in the photograph.
It was given to the "Life" representative who could be reached
at telephone number CR 3-1530 if it was desired to see the
photograph.

The exercise boys were paid by the owner of the
ranch and EBSEN paid a fee to the ranch to stable his horses.

Mr. EBSEN can be readhed at General Service Studios,
1040 North Las Palmas Avenue, Los Angeles, California, telephone
number 467-7935.

WALTER THOMAS RATHKE, Groom for VERN HUNTER,
Alameda County Fairgrounds, Pleasanton, California, advised
he first met SIRHAN SIRHAN at least three years ago when
both worked for GORDON BOWSHER, Yellow King Ranch, Chico,
California. He has also met SIRHAN's mother and one of his
brothers, not the one reportedly up for deportation. RATHKE
got to know SIRHAN quite well during this time and SIRHAN
never exhibited any leanings toward Communism or ever
became violent or exhibited any violence. RATHKE got the
impression SIRHAN did not want to return to Jordan and from
conversations thought.+ SIRHAN had made a move for American
citizenship. At no time during their conversations can RATHKE
recall SIRHAN ever mentioning any of the KENNEDYs or was the
subject of guns ever mentioned.

SIRHAN was working a quarter horse at Granja Vista
Del Rio Ranch near Chino when SIRHAN's horse bolted and
SIRHAN suffered head injuries from hitting the fence and
required hospitalization. RATHKE believes this happened
approximately September 1966 but is not sure of that date.
As a result of injury SIRHAN's pupil in one of his eyes,
believed his left, remains large and will not close and he
apparently has no peripheral vision out of that eye and can
no longer gallop horses so he had to give up being a groom.

RATHKE last saw SIRHAN in approximately June 1967 in
Pasadena where SIRHAN was working at a health food store. He
also saw SIRHAN's mother during this time and she indicated
SIRHAN "just wasn't himself" after the accident and RATHKE
stated SIRHAN was "more incommunicative" since the accident
but could not explain the exact changes in SIRHAN, RATHKE
has only seen SIRHAN for short periods of time since the
accident and has had no extensive conversations during these
meetings. When he last saw SIRHAN in Pasadena, RATHKE told .
SIRHAN he was joining the Theosophical Society but did not
discuss very extensively and has now read in the newspapers
that SIRHAN is reading books published by this society.
