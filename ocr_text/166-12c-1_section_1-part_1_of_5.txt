Dear Mr. Springer: . ;
i “hank you for your recent letter to President
Johnson. - : . fe

; You may be sure that the President shares your
concern and. that of the American people and their repre- -
sentatives regarding the relentless drive of the world --
Communist movement. The President is determined that
our country will successfully meet the challenges of
Communiem both here and abroad. a -

: . There fa no Federal legislation which effectively —
outlaws the Communist Party as such, and there is no law
preventing Communists from making spéeches or holding pri-
vate or public meetings. Moreover, it is mot illegal in
and of itself to be a member of the Communist Party. The
First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees to everyone
the right to speak and put in print his views on # subject
even though critical of our form. of government or of our
public officials. It grants to seach person the right to. .
associate and meet with persons of his ow choosing. _ -

' In this regard the judicial interpretation and.
application of the Smith Act which prohibits advocasy of
the violent overthrow ef the Government may. be of intemeat.: -
- She United States Supreme Court has held that the Smith Act
may not be applied in & nammer prohibit persons from
teaching or advocating the abatraet doct: of violent over-
throw of our Gevernment. The Supreme Court has held that if
it were to be go applied it would be held unconstitutional

as denying to Americans the right to express thetr opinions.

Tighten cage”

against Sirhan

. Associated Press - UP?
LOS ANGELES, June 10—With Sirhan Bishara Sirhan be-
hind bars, top prosecutors are meeting daily in hopes of closing
holes in Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. A233421.

That case contains the mur-
der charge against the 24-
year-old Jordanian immi-
grant accused of slaying
Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

Sirhan is to enter a plea to
the charge June 28.

‘Although Sirhan was ar-
rested at the scene of the
fatal shooting early Wednes-
day, and identified by several
witnesses as the New York
senator’s assailant, the case
presents unanswered que s-
tions.

Not the least of them is
whether there was a conspir-
acy behind the shooting.

Police haven't been able to
produce the dark-haired “girl
in the polka-dot dress.”
_ Sandy Serratio, 20, a Youth

for Kennedy worker, reported
seéing the girl run from the
Ambassador Hotel after the
shooting and say: .“‘We shot
him!?” :
1; Not the girl

Three young women, the
Jafest'a 19-year-old belly
daiicer, have claimed to be
the girl in the polka-dot
drdés, ‘all saying Miss Ser-
rang™: tnisunderstood their
wofds as they ran from the
i, Ba Miss Serrano says
nofélis: the girl she saw.

‘4¥ou've got to be color-
bli ad to think that’s the girl,”
Mi§s Serrano said of the belly
dafiter, Kathy Fulmer, who
had-told police she was wear-
ing a polka-dot scarf and a
bignde wig the night of the

muder.

Meanwhile, Pasadena police

sides imposing the strict-

ct) rity precautions ever
at dios/Angeles County jail

here, authorities are trying to
limit comment on the case by
all persons connected with it
and by public officials.

Of five other persons
wounded during the Kennedy
shooting, three have been re-
leased from hospitals and the
other two are reported in
good condition.

Sirhan has asked the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union to
help find a “big name” law-
yer to defend him.

A. L. Wirin, noted constitu-
tional lawyer and chief coun-
sel of the Southern California
ACLU, has been visiting Sir-
han daily in his cell.

Ask for attorney

This week Wirin will ask
presiding Judge Richard
Schauer of Los Angeles Su-
perior Court to call on the
Los Angeles Bar Association
and other legal groups to ob-
tain a defence attorney.

Superior Judge Arthur
Alarcon rejected Wirin’s mo-
tion at the arraignment for

_ “one or more outstanding

lawyers” to be appointed to
defend Sirhan but indicated
he would reconsider the re-
quest at a later time. .

Wirin emphasizes that the
ACLU has not undertaken the
defence of Sirhan and has
commended the courts and
prosecution for vigorously
protecting the defendant’s
rights, rare praise from the
ACLU... ~-

- Sirhan presently is repre-

sented by Wilbur F.- Little-
field, chief deputy trial law-
yer in the public defender’s
office. At his request, enter-
ing of a plea of guilt or inno-
cence was continued until
June 28.

Wirin hopes that a lawyer
of the calibre of Melvin Belli,
who defended Jack Ruby in
Dallas, would be sought by
the court:

“Our future may live be-

OTTAWA, June 10 — The
leaders of three national poli-
tical parties were among
some 1,000 people who at-
tened a Mass and memorial
service here yesterday for
Senator Robert F. Kennedy.
The service at Notre Dame
Cathedral was attended ‘by
Prime Minister Trudeau,
Conservative Leader Stan-
field, NDP Leader Douglas
and about 100 members of
the diplomatic corps, includ-
ing W. Walton Butterworth,
U.S. ambassador to Canada.
Archbishop J. A. Plourde,
head of the Ottawa Roman
Catholic archdiocese, cele-
brated the Mass and said
during a brief sermon that
ing would be “un-

He said the assassination

“inseribes itself in indelible -
characters not only in the his- j

tory of the United States of ©

* America but as well in the

conscience of humanity.”
Elsewhere in Europe,
American churches were
filled with large congrega-
tions of visitors and members
of American communities
who came to hear special
services for the slain senator.
In Paris, Catholic, Episco-
pal and other Protestant de-
nominations which serve the
American community held
special services in which
ministers and priests alike
condemned the violence
which killed Kennedy. They
praised his contribution to the
fight for peace, justice and
dignity of man. oo
‘In London, hundreds of visi-
tors formed a steady line into
the American embassy to add
their signatures to books af
condolences for Kennedy,
which now mount to volumes.
Students at International
Hall at London University
brought a huge red, white
and blue floral wreath to the
embassy which has been: in
the past the target of violent:
demonstrations by students. -

plained, “I feel I just had tv:

No metter the State, or the laws of that Stete, THIS ANIMAL
must be CAGED for the REMAINDER of it's NATURAL LIFE.

THIS ANIMAL is twenty four years of age. I shall pray every
hour of every day that THIS ANIMAL will live to age one hundred;
live with the horror of his act, and in utter hopelessness of ever
again being free...

To provide THIS ANIMAL with ANY loophole-with ANY possibility
of future freedom- would be not only a ghastly travesty on Justice,

ASSOCIATED TEACHERS AGAINST CORRUPTION

The following letter is reproduced in the interest of
the "Peo,le's Right to Know."
: Copies will be circulated to all presidential candidates
and to all law enforcement and investigation agencies - city, state,
and federal. Supporting documents are available.

2675 Ocean Ave,
Brooklyn, N.Y.
March 15, 1968

President Lyndon Johnson
The white House .
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

The enclosed letter to Richard Nixon and to Governor Rocke-
feller raises the crucial issue of the breakdown of law and order in
New York City and State. The most dangerous aspect of this breakdown
is that the judiciary, the police, the district attorneys and the
law enforcement machinery have been found to be in league with organ-
ized crime for the exploitation of the citizens who are heavily taxed
to support a government which betrays them.

_ I shall cite only a few of the major scandals that have
shaken the confidence of the public in their government officials,

1) The ‘"Marcus Case" shows that one of Mayor Lindsay's
most trusted commissioners was working with Tony "Duchs" Corrailo of
the Mafia to fleece the taxpayer by throwing “emergency” contracts to
their co-conspirators who cut up the graft and kickbacks between them.

2) The 350 man Police Narcotics Division has been "Shaken
up" by Police Commissioner Leary as a result of the proof submitted
by a dismissed police officer that the squad was riddled with corrup-
tion. The two most vicious examples of this corruption were the
theft from an office safe of several thousand dollars intended for
the widow of a policeman, and the revelation that police were peddling
the same narcotics they had seized from arrested narcotics "pushers."

3) The cynical attitude of the district attorneys and the
police officials is shown by their handling of the little notebook
which detective Peter E. Meenan lost in the subway over a year ago.
Meenan's notebook listing many firms to be touched for graft was
found and turned over to city law enforcement officials a year ago.

These officials "investigated" for a year and could
find no witnesses against Meenan. when finally the scandal of the
"little notebook" was exposed to public view, District Attorney Hogan
was unable to indict any of the grafting policemen,.

‘were given departmental trials have suffered no worse penalties than
reprimand or transfer,

The moral of these two ugly police scandals will not be lost
on police officers throughout the nation who continue to operate as
the official crime syndicate in uniform.

The moral is: Don't get caught! However, if you do slip up,
don't open your mouth about your Styeriors in the system - the worst
you can get is a slap on the wrist and a transfer. [In other words,
the graft you kick back to your superiors is protection insurance
and will be honored as such,

3) The judiciary in New York City and State has recently
been shaken by two scandals and is nervously trying to hold back
additional exposures of criminals whose black robes cover their black
deeds,

a) The case of Judge Lloyd Sarisohn in Nassau county
reveals a judge who consorts with prostitutes, fixes traffic tickets,
tampers with court records, and bullies the public who appear before
him.

b) The case of Judge Benjamin Schor in Kings County is
involved with a conspiracy to shake down a tavern owner for his
services in obtaining a liquor license,

Judge Schor is presently under indictment for perjur-
ing himself before the Grand Jury in connection with the shakedown
which involves also the New York State Liquor Authority.

Presiding Judge Beldock of the Appellate Division
who announced over a year ago that he would bring up Judge Schor on
charges of misconduct in office, has apparently decided to forget
the whole thing. Perhaps he fears it might revive the old scandal
in the State Liquor Authority where Mr. Morehouse, State Republican
Chairman and close friend of Governor Rockefeller, was involved.

The list of noisome scandals among judges and law
enforcement officials could be extended ad. nauseam. Currently, former
Judge Gustave Rosenberg is involved in an alleged conspiracy to
accept a bribe for giving a suspended sentence to a captain or "button"
man in the Cosa Nostra.

New York City and State under Mayor Lindsay and
Governor Rockefeller have already become a "disaster" area in law en-
forcement. It remains only for the President to issue an official
proclamation to that effect.

The enclosed letter to Mr. Nixon is an effort td brief
him on the breakdown of law and order in New York State under Governor

Rockefeller, who is his rival for the Republican Presidential nomin-
ation,

The fact that Attorney General Clark has assigned
a special Task Force to combat organized criine in New York City, is
evidence that you and the Justice Department are fully aware of the
national threat posed by the Crime Syndicate operating in our major
cities.

May I suggest that you make available to Senators
Robert Kemnedy and Hugene ieCarthy all of the facts on the threat
posed to the internal security of our aguion, by the treason of the
judiciary end law enforcement officials who have sold out to organized
erime.

LET'S GET OUT OF VIETNAM AND FIGHT THE SHANKER-
DONOVAN SELL-OUT OF TEACHERS AT HOME?

Is President Al Shanker and his entrenched bureau-
eracy a dummy front for the C,I.A.?

Are Vice President O'Neill and Richard Parrish
stooges for the Communist Intelligence service? |

What's behind this stage production of the Great
Debate on U.F.T,. policy on the Vietnam War?

The New York Times of March 8, 1967 quotes a Communist
Intelligence Expert who deserves to be heard on this problem
facing our union.

In discussing the strategy of Communist Intelligence
Services in the West, former Polish Communist official
Wiadyslaw Tykocinski said:

"Tt is not the recruiting of spies - that is quite.
easy. The whole thing is political - everything should show
that world opinion is supporting Communism.

"You are always looking here at home for Communists.
But they - the real Communists of the intelligence apparatus -
they don't want communists. They want citizens w money
and influence,

"They flatter the intellectuals and the non-Communist
left and they get them to do the work. They don't want them
as communist party members but as stooges who have entree in
society.

"To prove to the world that you are savings the world
and that you are the wave of the future, you need respectable
people - not workers , but students, teachers, churchmen, pro-
fessors and doctors.

This is the battle for influence that intelligence
officers say the general public does not understand.

Are Shanker and Kolodny the wave of the future for
the United Federation of Teachers? Is fake unionism where
Superintendent Donovan and Personnel Director Lang act as
hatchet-men for Shanker in purging his anti-communist opposi-
tion - is that the wave of the future for the rank-and-file
classroom teachers?

But on with the Great Debate on U,F,1, policy toward
the Vietcong!

We're listening!

ASSOCIATED TEACHERS AGAINST CORRUPTION

ASSOCIATED TEACHERS... AGAINST-CORRUPTION

Hell No! We won't go -- for Al Shanker's "Big Lie"
technique To cover up his rat-fink sellout of union teachers to
Donovan's kangaroo court departmental trials.

The Big Lie was Shanker's statement that any suspended
teacher will be defended by the Union if only he requests assistance.

The facts below throw Shanker's life back in his teeth and
in the teeth of every delegate who has joined in Shanker'’s conspiracy
of silence.

Demand that Shanker and Kolodny answer the charge of sell-
out of union members . . .

.

Beginning in May 1961 and continuing to date Mr. Shanker
has denied me all rights as a tenured teacher. He has been acting in
concert with the officials of the Board of Education.

The combination of this vicious discrimination and harass-
ment came at the Delegate Assembly of March 20, 1967.

There when I rose to answer a brazen falsehood of Mr.
Shanker, he replied in typical "big lie" fashion by stating that I
was not a member of the union.

Apparently, Mr. Shanker was officially pronouncing me an
"unperson" to excuse the fact that for six years he had denied me
every right spelled out in the Union Contract as well as under State
Education Laws.

The result of Mr. Shanker's failure to enforce the contract
has been that I have twice been suspended without pay and dismissed
from the school system with a loss in salary over the years amounting
to over $20,000 plus interest.

In support of my charges I sent a petition to Education
Commissioner Allen, This petition gives the details of the Board's
vicious illegal actions against me. At no time did Mr. Shanker and
the Union officials offer me any assistance in enforcing my rights
before Commissioner Allen.

IT was compelled to carry my demand for reinstatement with
pay through the Appellate Division. At this stage, the Union sub-
mitted an amicus curiae brief after having refused to supply me with
counsel. I won reinstatement at a cost of $9,000 in counsel fees
which represents a year's salary. The Union officials have refused
to contribute a single penny to the expense of litigation in defense
of teacher tenure,

I request that my fellow delegates redress this wrong done me.

/s/ Reuben R. Gordon
Member and Delegate of the United
Federation of Teachers
