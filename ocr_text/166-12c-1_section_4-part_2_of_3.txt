January 20, 1969

President Richard M. Nixon
The White House
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. President:

I want to congratulate you on this Inauguration Day and wish
you well. Mine and my family's prayers will be with you
during the next four years.

Today when you took your oath I wonder what your thoughts were.
Mine were that, if an assassin's bullet had not taken away the
life of Robert F. Kennedy, he would have stood where you did.

I am certain a thought like that must have crossed your mind
too.

You have now what you have dreamed about and worked for and,
by the grace (7???) of God been given. In gratitude for his
stepping aside, through no fault of his own, pay a debt to
Robert F. Kennedy by doing all in your power to have the
monster known as Sirhan Sirhan go to his speedy reward. I am
attaching Henry Taylor's column to let you see what I am
talking about.

Go on from there then and see that laws are passed to get

vid of all trash like that who kill, rape, maim and rob.

Never do away with Capitol Punishment - reve it up so that
assassinations will stop. When there is no punishment, why
keep in the hate. Believe me, mine is as great as anyone's

in the loss of the Kennedys - I have never recovered from
President Kennedy's death. He and his brother could have saved
the world and their deaths have set this country back a century.
Now, there is a threat against Edward. If he goes - so do I
---straight out of this country to Switzerland. I was a WAVE
in World War II on Admiral King's personal staff, my sister was
a Navy Nurse, I have a brother now who is a Major in SAC - last
of all, another brother was killed in Germany in April, 1945.

As I look at the cavalier attitude of the Courts at murderers,

I wonder what in the world my brother died for. It is DEFINITELY
not the country I knew and sacrificed for back in 1942.

Assuage some of my heartbreak at the loss of the Kennedys and
see that Sirhan comes to justice and to HELL as soon as you can.

Respectfully yours, hr». a. Vl). ina

. Dear Senator Jordan?

: , The subject of my letter is the two apparent assassins of .
_-Dr. King and Senator Kennedy. We naturally assume that in "due" | Pan
. ‘time and by "due" procass of law that they will be tried. .But I,

- for one, feel that the undue amount of time that is permitted and |
the legal maneuvering involved is far greater than necessary. IL
.' do not find in my mind an acceptance of the common explanation
. .;that such is necessary for the protection of. innocent people who ue

- a” “may! be- “charged with murder ; eet, : a

at ae ‘L. realize that’ thie is only very indirectly my problem. ;
- "perhaps it is more directly yours. I do feel that such outrageous. :

Dear Mr. Reinecka:

You have asked us teGEnsider the attached letter of Mr.
Kenneth Hahn, Supervisor for the Second District of the County ©
of Los Angeles, California, concerning the costs incident to _
the assassination of the. late ‘Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

It appears that virtually all these costs stem from the
apprehension, incarceration, and prospective trial of Mr. Sirhan
B, Sirhan, Mr. Sirhan is not charged with the violation of any
federal law, The murder of a candidate for the Presidency is
not now a federal crime, nor was it at.the time of the assassi-
nation of Senator Kennedy. 18 U.$.C. 1751 (Supp. III, 1965-67).
Moreover, at the time of the assassination there was no provi-
sion for federal protection of Presidential candidates. The

‘absence of such provisions presumably reflected the policy.

judgment of Congress that protection of candidates for. federal
office should be a matter of local control and responsibility.
Since the assassination of Senator Kennedy, Congress has au-
thorized federal Protection for candidates s P.L, 90-331, 82

Stat. 170. .

We are not aware of any. precedent for the federal govern-
ment reimbursing, localities for the costs of prosecuting de-
fendants charged with violations of state lew in connection
with the murder of federal officials. Whether or not Congress
should reimburse the County of Los Angeles for the coste of
prosecuting the alleged murderer of Senator Kennedy is a matter
of legislative judgment for Congress.

I hope this information is of interest to Mr. Hahn.
Sincerely,

Frank M, Wozencraft
