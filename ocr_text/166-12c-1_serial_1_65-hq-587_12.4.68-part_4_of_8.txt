JEANFREAU continued that his plane landed in Los
Angeles on the evening of June 4, 1968, and he estimates that
he and his companion arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, Los
Angeles, at about 9:00 p.m. that date. JEANFREAU recalls that
he and PAILET registered at the hotel at the same time as
a prominent psychiatrist whose name JEANFREAU does not recall,
who was scheduled to be a guest speaker at a medical convention
at the Ambassador Hotel the following day.

JEANFREAU said that he and PAILET went up to their
rooms, staying there only about 15 minutes, or long enough
to deposit their luggage and freshen up. At about 9:15 p.m.,
they both left the hotel and went to a number of night spots
on the "Strip” in Los Angeles, Since it was their first visit
to the city.

JEANFREAU said that he did not return to the hotel
until after Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY had been shot. He
stated that he first learned of the shooting from a cab
driver with whom he was riding.

JEANFREAU continued that since he had only spent
about 15 minutes at the hotel prior to the assault on
Senator KENNEDY, he could furnish absolutely no information
regarding the matter. JEANFREAU said that he later saw press
photographs of SIRHAN B. SIRHAN, but SIRHAN did not appear
