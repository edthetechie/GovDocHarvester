Mrs. HALDOR LILLENAS (LOLA), age 74, 5232 Roe Avenue,
Mission, Kansas, advised she and her late husband were sponsors
for BISHARA SIRHAN and family. Two oldest children of SIRHAN
family remained in Jordan because LILLENAS refused to sponsor
them as they were of legal age.

LILLENAS stated she and her husband, who was an
ordained minister of the Church of the Nazarene, went on a
European vacation in 1955. While visiting in Jordan, BISHARA
SIRHAN contacted LILLENAS and inquired as to the possibility
of coming to the United States. LILLENAS decided to sponsor
the SIRHAN family as their inquiries reflected the SIRHAN family
to be a worthy christian family.

Mr. LILLENAS, working through Church World Service and
the Friends Organization, became the sponsor of the SIRHAN
family and in November, 1957, SIRHAN came to Pasadena, California,
and lived in the LILLENAS home for about three months until
suitable housing and employment could be obtained.

BISHARA SIRHAN left his family in 1958 and returned
to Jordan because he felt living in the United States did not
allow him to control his family as in the past. BISHARA SIRHAN
wrote letters to his wife requesting her to return to Jordan
and if she refused he would obtain a divorce. Mrs. SIRHAN
refused to return to Jordan and told LILLENAS since she had been
married in the Greek Orthodox Church, no divorce would be granted
to her husband.

LILLENAS advised her husband had handled all the
responsibilities pertaining to the SIRHAN family and after
Mr. LILLENAS died in 1959, she has had only one contact with the
SIRHAN family which was in about 1963 when AYDA SIRHAN, a
daughter, died. At this time, LILLENAS saw only Mrs, SIRHAN
and she visited for only fifteen minutes. LILLENAS moved from
Pasadena, California, to Mission, Kansas, about three years ago
and has had no contact with the SIRHAN family since moving to
Mission, Kansas,

During the time LILLENAS knew SIRHAN, politics were
never discussed and they always appeared to be a devout christian
family. SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was recalled as a well-behaved,
industrious, and obedient cnilds

LILLENAS stated her contact with SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN was only at the time when they resided for the three
month period in her home in Pasadena, California, at which time
SIRHAN was a child approximately thirteen years of age.

DAVID KAL HAINES, 220 East Sierra Madre Avenue,
Apartment F, Sierra Madre, California, furnished the
following information:

He is nineteen years old and a student at Pasadena
City College, Pasadena, California. Since the end of April
1968, he was a volunteer worker at the Pasadena Headquarters
of the Youth for KENNEDY Club. On Tuesday, June 4, 1968, he
was busy at the Youth for KENNEDY Headquarters in Pasadena
until approximately 9:00 p.m. At that time, he and a fellow
worker, RAY (last name unknown), decided to go to the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles to await the election
returns. They went in RAY's automobile, arriving at the
Ambassador at approximately 9:45 p.m. They joined the throng
that had gathered in the lower level ballroom where television
sets were placed to follow the returns.

He met several of his fellow workers from Pasadena
and recalls meeting SANDRA SERRANO, who was in charge of
the Pasadena Youth for KENNEDY Club, sometime between 10:00 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m. SERRANO was in a group standing near a bar
set up in the foyer area at the entrance of the ballroom.
As she was obviously underage, he ordered Her a screwdriver --
drink from the bar and chatted with her for awhile. To his
knowledge, that was the only drink she had that evening.

He rejoined the crowd in the ballroom and was at
that location when the news that Senator KENNEDY had been
shot was received. He watched the proceedings on television
in the ballroom for some time and then started to move
through the crowd in the ballroom looking for his friends.
He came across his fellow worker, RAY, who had taken him to
the Ambassador, who was in a complete state of collapse at
the news and was lying on the floor. He and a girl, name
unknown, who had met RAY at the ballroom, gave assistance to
RAY and he remained with them until RAY was sufficiently
recovered, that he could leave RAY in the girl's care. He
then lent assistance to an unidentified elderly lady who asked

in the vicinity of the hotel, which he did. Upon returning

to the hotel, he again met SANDRA SERRANO, who was with
another Pasadena worker, IRENE CHAVEZ, They met in the
vicinity of the shop area or arcade of the lower level. He
estimates that this was at least one hour after he first heard
of the shooting.

SERRANO was extremely upset, crying, and distraught.
He recalls her saying "Oh, DAVID, you don't know what I have
seen" and "What should I do". She also said other things
which he cannot now recall, but as he was also upset and
trying to get back in the ballroom to where he had left RAY,
he attached no significance to what SERRANO had said. He
believed it only related to the fact that Senator KENNEDY had
been shot. He then returned to the ballroom, searched for his
friends, and had no further contact or conversation with
SERRANO.

While he was at the Ambassador Hotel, both prior to
and after the shooting, he did not see anyone resembling
the photographs or general description of suspect, SIRHAN
SIRHAN, nor could he recall seeing any women in a white dress
with black polka dots.

He has known SANDRA SERRANO since April 1968, and
she was in charge of the Pasadena Office of the Youth for
KENNEDY Club. He considers her to be a reliable, level
headed and a responsible person.

He is entering the Marine Corps in mid-July 1968
and prior to that time will spend two weeks vacationing in
Texas where he can be reached in care of Mr. BOB PHILLIPS,
4007 Cornelia, Greenville, Texas.

Street, Los Angeles, California, a stock brokerage firm. He
intends to return to Yale on approximately September 15, 1968.

Upon arriving home from Yale, he volunteered his
services to the Youth for KENNEDY Club in Pasadena and
worked there on Monday June 3, 1968, until 9:00 p.m. and on
Tuesday, June 4, 1968, the day of the California primary.

On June 4, 1968, at about 8:15 p.m., he and some
of his fellow-workers decided to go to the Ambassador Hotel
in Los Angeles to await the election returns. He went to
the Ambassador with SANDY SERRANO, IRENE CHAVEZ, GEORGE

He was in the lower level baliroom when he first heard
the news that Senator KENNEDY had been shot. This is directly
below the ballroom where Senator KENNEDY made his victory speech.
He believes that approximately twenty minutes later he left the
ballroom, with DINAH CHURCHILL, and was in the long corridor
leading to the entrance of the lower level ballroom, when he
again met SERRANO. She was alone, sobbing hysterically and
talking incoherently. He took her into his arms and attempted
to comfort her. He cannot recall anything in particular that
SERRANO said, at that time, but his impression was that it
simply dealt with the horrible fact that Senator KENNEDY had
been shot.

As his companion, DINAH CHURCHILL, was also visibly
upset and standing alone down the corridor, he excused
himself and took DINAH out of the hotel.

He was, thereafter, in and out of the hotel
several times searching for SANDRA and IRENE CHAVEZ in order
to take them home, but saw neither one. He assumed they had
obtained other rides and left the hotel at approximately
2:30 a.m. to return to Pasadena.

During the period he was at the Ambassador Hotel,
both prior to and after the shooting, he did not see anyone
resembling the photosraph or description of suspect SIRHAN
SIRHAN, nor could he recall seeing any women in a white dress
with black polka dots.

He first met SANDRA SERRANO on June 3, 1968, at the
Youth for KENNEDY Headquarters in Pasadena where she was in
charge He had an opportunity to tal’: to her extensively
on both June 3 and June 4, 1968 and considers her to be a
reliable and responsible person.

VINCENT DI PIERRO was interviewed
at the Ambassador Hotel just prior to his viewing seven white
dresses with black polka dots in an effort to pick out a dress
similar to the one worn by the woman he previously described
as being in the kitchen area of the Embassy Room, Ambassador
Hotel, just before Senator KENNEDY was shot.

DE PIERRO recalled talking to SANDRA SERRANO about
a woman wearing a white dress with black polka dots while they
were sitting together waiting to be interviewed by the police
after the shooting. They did not describe the dress to each
other, except to mention the fact that it was a white dress with
black polka dots.

DE PIERRO said no details about the person wearing
this dress were discussed since a police officer saw them
talking and warned them not to discuss the case.
