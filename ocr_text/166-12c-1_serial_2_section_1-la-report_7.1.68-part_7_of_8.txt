interviewed at the hotel at which time he furnished the following
signed statement:

"June 10, 1968
Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California

"I, Niwa Yoshio, hereby furnish the following
voluntary statement to Frank E. Chovanec who has
identified himself to me as a special agent of the
FBI.

"T have been advised that I could be required
to appear before a court of law.

"T was born on May 18, 1946 in Japan and arrived
in the United States approximately five years ago.
I reside at 2877 Edgehill Drive, Los Angeles, Calif-
ornia and have been employed as a cook at the
Ambassador Hotel since January, 1968. On June 4,
1968, I was working from 5 PM to 1 AM on June 5,
1968 in the 'coldmeat! department in the kitchen.
I don't remember exactly at what time but it was
shortly after 12 midnight when I heard a noise which
sounded like a 'snap' of a party streamer. There
were about five 'pops! or 'snaps! which did not sound
like a gun.

"T ran from the kitchen, my station, to the
Embassy service pantry. I saw a lot of people screaming
and crying. I saw people holding a man who had a gun
in his hand. I ran over to them and tried to reach
over the steamer counter to grap his arm but someone

"else held on to him and pulled him away further down
along the service pantry and onto another steamer
counter. Just before this they took the gun away
from him. After this I held his arm for a short
time but don't remember how long. Someone said to
get a rope. So someone else took his arm while I
went for a rope. I ran to the room service but
didn't get a rope and came back to hold the man's
arm again. I held his arm until the police arrived.

"While I did not see the shooting occur when I
ran into the service pantry I heard someone say
‘they shot him! and ail I could think of was Senator
Kennedy. I did not know the size of the gun but it
was small and dark,

“The man I was holding was about 5 feet 3 or 4
inches and 'skinny'. He had wavey hair but I can't
remember the color only that it was long. He had
small eyes, thin lips and dark complexion. He wore
a shite shirt, no tie, and light blue jacket.

"I will never forget his face even through I
have never seen him before. I do not know if he was
with anyone else at the hotel.

"During the time I held him I did not hear him
Say anything.

"I have read the above statement consisting of
this and two other pages and I have initialed each
page and it is true and correct to the best of my
knowledge.
