arrangements for the interview having been made through
his attorney, GEORGE T. DAVIS. OWEN appeared at the
office with BEN HARDISTER, a private detective and WESLEY
GARDNER, a former Deputy Sheriff in Napa County. Both of
these men were acting as body guards for OWEN. Prior to
the interview, GARDNER advised that OWEN had been under.
sedation and was somewhat tired. OWEN was interviewed
out of the presence cf HARDISTER and GARDNER.

At the outset of the interview, OWEN was
advised that he was being interviewed concerning his
knowledge of an individual whom he had identified to
his: attorney DAVIS and the press as possibly
being identical with SIRHAN B. SIRHAN and the fact that
he has stated that he had ‘received threatening calls from
persons unknown.

OWEN furnished the following information:

On June 3,°1968, he was in downtown Los Angeles
on business between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m. He explained that
he has part interest in a fighter named RIP O'RILEY. He also
is a minister and has been since 1937. He said that he has
approximately fifteen ponies which he keeps at his ranch at
Santa Ana and takes these horses around to shopping centers
to give free rides to children to get them to come to church.
He said that his church is located in Oxnard, California, |
and that he kept some of the ponies at his. ranch in Oxnard.
His purpose for being in Los Angeles on June 3, 1968 was to
pick up some sporting goods for O'RILEY at the United
Sporting Goods Store. He picked up a pair of boxing shoes,
a white robe, some trunks and other equipment.

He had purchased his merchandise at the sporting

at a stop light and two individuals approached his truck.

‘He said he was. driving a 1942 Chevrolet pick-up truck which

had a large palomino horse ornament on the hood. When the

“two young men approached his truck, the taller of the two

asked if he was going out Wilshire Boulevard and when he
said that he was, this individual asked if they could
ride in the back of the truck, to which OWEN agreed. He
described these individuals as follows: ; :

‘Number 1 |

They proceeded west on Wilshire Boulevard. At the
intersection of Vermont and Wilshire, OWEN stopped for a
traffic light and as he did so, both men got out of the truck.
Number one went directly to a bus stop near where the truck:
stopped and greeted a man and woman. The man was about *
thirty to forty years of age and dark complected, possibly.
Mexican. The woman was dressed in slacks with long dirty oo

blond hair, light complexion, possibly a hippie. Number
two started to follow-Number one but turned around and

_ came back to the truck. He opened the door and asked

' to ride up front to continue toward Hollywood. When OWEN
nodded approval, he climbed in the front seat. They pro-
ceeded on leaving Number one at the bus stop. :

During the ride, the conversation of horses” came
up and Number two asked OWEN if he owned horses and he said
that he did. Number two remarked that he use to work at a
race track and at presént needed a horse. OWEN said that
he had horses. for sale and offer‘ ed to sell him one for
$300. They talked some more about buying and selling a
horse and Number two asked OWEN if he could stop for a
short time so that he could see a friend who worked. in a
kitchen nearby where they were at the moment. . OWEN said
he turned off Wilshire Boulevard onto a side street, the
name .of which he does not know. He described the street
as a deadend street that was several blocks long. . He
parked the truck and waited while Number two went to ‘see
his friend. .

. After a wait of about ten minutes, OWEN decided
that Number two was not going to return so he began to
turn the truck around and leave. As he was doing this, he
observed Number two come through an opened gate in a fence
behind which was a tall building with many rooms. OWEN ~
said that he was later advised by a police officer of the
Los Angeles Police Department, University Station, that
this building was the Ambassador Hotel. ;

; ‘When Number two got back.in the truck, OWEN

again began making conversation and asked the man if he

was Mexican. He told him that he was not, saying that he
was from Jordan having either come from Jordan thirteen
years ago or when he was thirteen years old. OWEN could
not recall which he said. He said that his name was JOE and
gave a sirname which OWEN did not understand,. but which
OWEN believed sounded like ZAHARIAS. OWEN said at about
this time, he was arriving at his destination, that is a
shoe shop and tailor shop where he was going to leave the
boxing shoes and the robe for O'RILEY to have shamrocks put

on. He said that he parked the truck in the Hollywood Ranch
Market's lot and ‘took the shoes to a bootblack named- SMITTY.
While he was conducting this business, Number two stayed

in the truck. He returned to the truck and drove a few blocks
and let Number two out on the corner of Wilshire near a’
bowling alley and a go-go topless bar. Before he left Number
two agreed to meet OWEN at 11:00 p.m. on the same corner at

_ which time he would have the money to buy the horse.

He met the fighter O'RILEY that evening and left |
him shortly before 11:00 p.m. and arrived back at the
agreed meeting place and observed a 1958 or 1959 Chevrolet,
off-white in color, in which there were three men anda girl.
OWEN. believed that. one of the men and the girl may have been
the same couple that Number one was talking to earlier. at the
bus stop. He could not get a good look at the second man
in the car. Number two came over to the truck and showed
him a $100 bill saying he would have the rest of the money

the next day early in. the morning OWEN told him he would
stay overnight in Los Angeles and. pointed out a hotel which
was either St. Mark's or St. Martin, which would be where he
would stay. He registered at this hotel as J. C. OWEN and
requested the clerk give him a call at 8:00 a.m. However,
he said that he was up at 7:00 a.m. and just as he was
leaving the hotel he received a call from a man asking if-
he was the man with the pick-up and horse. OWEN acknowledged
that he was and said he would meet him in a few.minutes at
the truck. As he was going to the truck he saw the same
white car as before parked at the curb and Number one and
the girl whom he saw before, were sitting in the car. The
man who had been at the bus stop was standing by the truck
and as OWEN approached he said "JOE could not make it". He’
offered OWEN a $100 bill and asked if he could bring the
horse. to the same location that night at which time the
remainder of the money would be available. OWEN did not
take the money and explained that he would not be able to
deliver the horse that night because of a prior commiti ment
that he had in Oxnard. He left the man, giving him his ©
business card, which had his home address and an unlisted
telephone number and requested that JOE call him if he was

interested in the horse. OWEN then proceeded to Oxnard on

business and returned to Los Angeles the morning

of June 5, ‘1967.

OWEN said he went to the Coli seum Hotel to see a
man, BERT, who owns the restaurant and bar in the hotel.
He had, at this time, three ponies in his trailer, which

_he had obtained in Oxnard. While in the restaurant he learned

of the KENNEDY shooting hearing it on television.

Someone gave him a copy of the "Hollywood Citizen News",

which contained a picture of SIRHAN B. SIRHAN, which he

noted looked like the man he knew as JOE. He * aiscussed this
with BERT and other of his. friends in the restaurant and -

they suggested that he go to the Los Angeles Police Department,
University Station, which was nearby and tell them what had
occurred. At first he said that he did not want to do this,
but they convinced him that as a good citizen this would be

“the thing to do. That same day, he went to the Police

Department and gave them the same story that he was now
relating. He said that he was at the station from about
2: 00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. ©

On June 6, 1968, several phone calls were received
at his residence which were answered by his wife and daughter

‘and an each occasion, the person calling hung up without’

saying anything. When the phone rang again, OWEN said he
answered it. and the caller said "Keep yowmother blankéedy
blank mouth shut about the horse deal". He believes the
caller was a man but his voice was not familiar.

_ On June 18 or 19,.1968, OWEN received a call from
the Los Angeles Police Department requesting that he come
downtown to the Detective Bureau on the third floor between

- 1:30 and 2:30. He took another man named PERKINS with him.

When he arrived, the officer on duty asked him to wait,
saying that the officer who wanted to interview him was
going to be a little bit late. OWEN explained to them
that he was on his way to Phoenix and desired to proceed
with the interview if possible. After a few minutes wait,

‘the. interview proceeded. He said he was handed a number

of pictures and asked to pick out the picture of the man

“who looked like the one who had ridden with him in the truck.

He said that after looking through the pictures, he picked
out one stating that this man looked similar to the man
whom he had given a ride. He recalls that PERKINS asked

said that he could not answer this question. At the time of ~
this interview, he told the officer that he had received a
threatening call and that he would be staying in Phoenix
for approximately one week.

On June 22, 1968, OWEN said that he received another
Call with the caller again using profanities, stating
‘something to the effect "Keep your mother blankedy blank
mouth shut or your family may be hurt".. OWEN stated that
no further calls or threats have been received. : : .

Police Department, she ig a well-known and notorious
police complainant.

WHITE stated that on August 13, 1968, she and
her sister-in-law, BONNIE WHITE, were returning from ;
Milton-Freewater, Oregon, en route to Spokane, Washington.
She stated thates they left Walla Walla, Washington, at
approximately 11:30 PM, they observed a young man beside
the road hitchhiking in the direction of Spokane, Washington.
She stated that they felt sorry for the young man due to
the time of night and decided to pick him up. The man
gave his name as PHILLIP ETHRIDGE, age 19, and stated that
he had come from Alaska and was on his way to Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho, He stated that he had been hitchhiking and as he
had no place to sleep in Walla Walla, Washington, decided
to keep going en route to Coeur d' Alene, Idaho.

WHITE stated that as they proceeded toward Pullman,
Washington, ETHRIDGE informed them that he was going to have

emphasized the fact that he was not going to in any way
‘molest either of them. :

WHITE stated that outside Colfax, Washington,
they passed a dirt road and at this time he ordered her
to stop the vehicle and back up. She stated that she told
him that she could not back up and then he informed her to
turn around. WHITE stated that she turned the vehicle
around and headed back toward Colfax, Washington. As they
passed a road, now known to her as the Albion Road, he told
her to turn. She stated that they drove about five miles
up the road away from the highway at which time he ordered

The following investigation was conducted by SA

AT P@MONA, CALIFORNIA

Various attempts were made to contact LOUISE
KALSO (phonetic) at the Red Lion Restaurant, Foothill Boulevard,
and North Garey Avenue.

On July 30, 1968, CAROL TAVER, head waitress,
Red Lion Inn, Foothill Boulevard and North Garey Avenue,
advised that LOVISE KELLIS is a waitress employed by the
Red Lion Inn, however she is on an extended vacation in the
east and it is unknown exactly when she will return.

Mrs. TAVER was asked regarding her knowledge as
to the information that SIRHAN SIRHAN was well known
to the waitresses at the Red Lion Inn. Mrs. TAVER stated
that this is strictly a rumor inasmuch as there was an
individual who had eaten at the Red Lion Inn on several
occasions prior to the murder of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY
and that they have not seen the individual since the
murder. She stated that after pictures came out in the
newspapers of SIRHAN SIRHAN, there were remarks made
that the individual who had eaten there resembled SIRHAN
SIRHAN very much and it was felt poss&ble by some of the
girls that this was SIRHAN STRHAN. She stated, however,
that none of the waitresses at the restaurant were personally
acquainted with the individual other than having waited upon
him several times and that none of the waitresses knows
any personal background or any personal information whatsoever
about this individual, in fact they do not even know his
name, nor do they know that this is the same individual known
as SIRHAN SIRHAN.

Mrs. TAVER stated that she is quite certain that

LOUISE KELLTS has no further information than any of the rest

Mrs. ADA BUTEAU, who resides on the second floor at
51 Congress Street, Hartford, Connecticut, was interviewed
and furnished the following information concerning her ex-
periences on the evening of June 28, 1968:

She stated during the early evening of June 28, 1968,
she was alone at the Metropole Restaurant on Main Street,
Hartford, Connecticut, having a few drinks. She stated she
later met a couple of friends at the bar and conversed with
them briefly. A short time later, a man about 30, who was
drinking at the bar struck up a conversation with her and a
short time later asked if he could accompany her home. She
stated she agreed and they walked to her apartment at 51 Congress
Street, Hartford. BUTEAU stated that at the apartment he
talked quite a bit and his line of conversation frightened
her. She maintained that while both she and her guest had been
drinking, they were not staggering or incoherent in their
speech. She advised that he said he was a communist, of Arabic
origin, and was “against the KENNEDY family". BUTEAU stated
he claimedto know SIRHAN SIRHAN, the man who assassinated
Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. BUTEAU stated she became very con-
cerned for her safety and in order not to agitate the man,
kept agreeing with him. She stated he wag not rude while
with her and made no "passes" at her. She advised that after
about one half hour in his company at the apartment she asked
him to leave because she had things to do. She stated he left
without argument.

BUTEAU advised that the man left a penknife on the
kitchen table. She exhibited the knife which was about two
inches long of stainless steel with three blades, one of which
is a combination can opener and screwdriver, one a nail file
and the remaining a blunt knife blade. The knife bears the
following inscription on the handle: "Palmdale Service. Station,
MERRILL ROGERS, PH 23631, P. O. Box 1200". The knife appears
to be the type given customers for advertising purposes. The
name MERRILL ROGERS is probably the owner of the service station.
No stains were noted on the blades.
