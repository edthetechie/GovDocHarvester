: LEWIS A. PAILET, Vice President, Specialty Food
Sales Company, 725 Focis Street, was interviewed at his
office and he advised as follows;

He and a colleague, EDMOND G,. JEANFREAU, arrived in
Los Angeles, California, by plane on the evening of
dune 4, 1968. The trip was a business trip on behalf of
their company, and arrangements for the trip were made by”
Travel Consultants, a travel agency located at 338 International
Trade Mart, 2 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.

PAILET estimated that he and JEANFREAU arrived at ;
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, at approximately 9:00 p.m.,
on June 4, 1968. They spent a few minutes in their rooms
after checking into the hotel, and they both left the hotel
at about 9:15 p.m., planning to visit some night clubs in
Los Angeles and see the city since neither PAILET nor
JEANFREAU had visited Los Angeles before. He and JEANFREAU
went to Several clubs on the Sunset Strip before PAILET and
JEANFREAU separated. PAILET indicated that he was going to
return to the hotel as he was tired.

PAILET continued that he entered the lobby of the
Ambassador Hotel at about 11:50 or 11:55 p.m., on June 4, 1968.
He observed considerable activity in the hotel, and he learned
from bystanders that Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was then
participating in a victory celebration in the hotel following
his victory in the California primary in his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.

PAILET said that when he learned of the Senator's
presence in the hotel, he decided to remain in the lobby area
of the Ambassador Hotel to observe the festivities and to
perhaps see the Senator as he left the hotel.

He recalls standing near a fountain in the bbby
of the hotel, near some television cameras, when he observed
a person run from the corridor leading from the Embassy Room

was carrying what appeared to PAILET to be some type of card-
board tube, such as those in which blueprints are carried.
PAILET recalls several other people came out of the corridor
immediately after the lone individual, and they appeared

to have been pursuing him. The lone person and the following
group ran to another section of the lobby, out of PAILET's
sight, and it appeared that if the group were chasing the
Single individual, they caught up to him somewhere in the
lobby.

PAILET described the lone individual as a dark
complexioned white male who was not wearing a Suit-and=tie
type of attire. He recalls no other details of the individual
as he only glimpsed at him for a short while. He remembers
thinking that the lone individual must be some type of celebrity
who was hurrying in order to avoid newsmen and autograph
seekers. He does not recall a single thing more about the lone
male he saw being pursued, and he did not recognize anything
distinctive or familiar about him.

PAILET said that he learned of the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY only seconds after it occurred as word of the incident
Spread rapidly by word of mouth among the bystanders in the
hotel lobby. PAILET said that he does not specifically recali
whether he observed the aforementioned individual being chased
before or after he learned of Senator KENNEDY's being shot,
but he thinks that the pursuit incident occurred before word
came of the Senator's assault or otherwise he feels he would
have paid much more attention to the person being pursued.

PAILET went on to say that after the shooting became
generally known in the Ambassador Hotel, some television sets
were set up in various small rooms off the lobby and he joined
other bystanders in theSe rooms to watch the subsequent events
on television. He said that he engaged in small talk and
discussions of the Senator's shooting with others in the room,


--- Page 8 ---

whose identities he does not know, until about 3:00 a.m.,

at which time he went upstairs to his room and went to bed.
During these talks, he heard nothing mentiomed of a conspiracy
or any other pertinent reference to SIRHAN. B. SIRHAN.

PAILET said that the foregoing constitutes all he
is able to furnish on this matter. He affirmed that he has
never seen SIRHAN and he had heard no talk at all in the
hotel regarding SIRHAN's presence in the Ambassador Hotel
on the evening of June 4, 1968 or of any type of conspiracy
that may have been in progress. He pointed out that at the
time the Senator was shot, he had spent a very short time
in the hotel, this being only up in his room earlier in the
evening, and in the lobby later, and that he had never visited
Los Angeles pricr to June 4, 1968.

PAILET also said that he had not been previously
interviewed by any law enforcement officer regarding this
matter. He mentioned that there were just too many people
in and around the Ambassador Hotel on the evening of
June 4-5, 1968, for.everyone to have been contacted.

HENRIETTA STERLITZ, 1109 Brackenridge Road,

Mirror, Third and Cherry Streets. She and two companions,
. DELORES KNAPEK and EVELYN PLANAVSKY, booked a tour with
Sprowles TWA Travel Agency, 521 Seventh Street,
New Kensington, Pa., and left Pittsburgh enroute to
‘San Francisco and ultimately Los Angeles, California.
They arrived in Los Angeles om Sunday afternoon, “
June 2, 1968, and registered at the Ambassador Hotel.

HENRIETTA wltimately learned that Senator |

ROBERT KENNEDY was. also staying at that hotel and was _

to speak later that day. She and her companions remained
in the corridor leading from the Embassy Room to the lobby,!:
outside the rest room area, in order. to see Senator KENNEDY
_ and hear what he had to say. She advised that they

remained in that corridor from approximately 6:00 p.m.,

on June 4, 1968, until 12:15 a. He, On June 5, 1968,
when the’ shooting occurred.

While in the corridor, the only suspicious
activity she observed involved two teenage boys and one
teenage girl. They would occasionally pop balloons, ; a
which had been placed in the kotel for the victory rally
and after the balloons were popped they would say, “What’s
all the excitement,” amd another would reply, “Kennedy’s
dead.” They did this several.times and, at the tine, —
she felt that they were just horsing around even though
ait was in bad taste.

At approximately 12: 15 a. m., she heard three or
four shots. At the time, she thought that someone was
popping more balloons until she heard an unknown individual
say, “They shot Kennedy, Kennedy's dead.” She did not —
believe it at first, but when she saw one of KENNEDY’s ;
group <carrieéd out of the hotel and heard all the crying nd
and commotion, she was convinced.

consider unusval was a party in an a¥oining room which was
very noisy, and which continued to be so even after the
word of the assassination of Senator KENNEDY was publicized
on radio and television, She also felt that it was unusual
when a helicopter on the helicopter pad at the hotel left
just after the ambulance left the hotel with, presumably,

*- Senator KENNEDY, and the helicopter did not put its lights
on until it reached an altitude over the building. While
this struck her as unusual, she had no information which
. would connect the incident with ‘the asses sinaticn of Senator

KENNEDY. ; ek

' She was in possession of no information which
would indicate a possible conspiracy in the KENNEDY
assassination, she did not know SITRHAN B, SIRHAN, nor did
