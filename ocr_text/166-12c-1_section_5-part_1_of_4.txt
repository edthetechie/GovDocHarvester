Gentlemen:

some way we can stop this circus about/Sirhan Sirhan} He
is guilty and should either be put to Geath or sent back
where he came from. Neither he, nor his fapily are U.S,
citizens, Why are we using the taxpayers money to put on
this ridiculous performance,

I think the above is a sbout ts Is there not

There isn't another country in the world'that would
tolerate all this nonsense. They would either execute the
person or send them back and not fool around with all this
waste of money and time.

The evidence I heard this morning on the TV is
ridiculous too, The attorney claims Sirhan was in a trance
and achieved peace through the shooting. Isn't that great!

Yourf’ very truly

Barcelona, 15 de Febrero de 1.969

Al Excelentisimo Senor
Ministro de Justicia de los E.Ushe

Excomo Senor,

No debe haber clemencia para el asesino de Robert Kannedy.
La justicia no debe ser mas que ma , la de la razon , la equidad y la le-
galidad. No comprendemes porque esta costando tato dinero al Tesoro Nacio=
nal este asunto , prolongado hasta no poder ms., manteniendolo por tanto
tiempo, cuando en el] mismo instante de cometer su designio habia que li-
quidarlo inmediatamentee

Para que esos gastos de abogados de la defenea a cargo del
Estado ? Que es lo que tienen que defender ?y que argumentos pdrian invene
tar para alargar el proceso y ganar vas dénero ? Esta causa este perdida
antes de empezar el Juicio.... Lo que se ve es dar tiempo al tiempo para
preperar su absolucion, o declararle inocente. Esta es la Damocracia Ans=
ricana ? Donde esta la justicia ni la Ley ?

Este asesino ha matado y se la cogido con las armas en la
mano por al Gurda: espaldas. de Robert disparando contra su victima. No debe
haber mas juicio para el que oe] de la horca para castigar a otros con el

No tenemos tambien porque saber porque ha matado ? y cuales
eran los miviles que le han inducido a cometer este barbaro asesinato de:
um inocente, y un pilar de la Nacion Americana. Kl que mta debe morir
sean cuales fueren los atenuantes que la defensa pudiera presentar en su di
dia. 0 es que que se pretende ignorar los dogmas de la razon y la Justicia

No Sener/ La sangre de Robert y su memoria claman al ciele para
exigir vengansza por su muerte y se haga caer sobre el. indudable culpable:
el rigor de la Leys No lo dudamos, y asi lo esperamos que se cumpla para:
orgullo.y honor de: la Nacion Americana en el] Mundo entero. :

Muy respetuosamente le saluda hombre amante dela
Ley

26 February 1969

Office of Fublic Information
Department of Justice

Washington, D.C

Gentlemen:
On 3 February 1969, Metromedia News
in Washington reported as follows:
"Federal agents investigating the murder of Senator Robert
Kennedy have uncovered some evidence which hints at con-
syiracy...

when the accused assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was apprehended,
police discovered that keys in his pocket fit a car perked
a block from the hotel... The car belonged to a kitchen

worker at the hotel at which Kennedy was shot... Reliable

sources also report that the Secret Service had a file

on this kitchen worker, and had it been the president

who was in the hotel, the Secret Service would have detained

the man before the President ever came to town. While

the Secret Service had no file on Sirhan Sirhan before

the Tennedy murder...they did aprarently consider this

kitchen worker in question at least a thrert to presidents."

I would like to know what investir-
ationr_were conducted by federal arents, and what reports of that

work are available,
