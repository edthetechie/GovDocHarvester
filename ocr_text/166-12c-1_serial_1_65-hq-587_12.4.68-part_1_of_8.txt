NORMAN JACQUES, Rhode Island State Senator,
advised that he is presently residing at the junction of
Great Road and Wilbur Road in Lincoln, Rhode Island. He
stated that he unsuccessfully ran for a congressional seat
during the past primary election in the State of Rhode Island.
He stated that on June 4 and 5, 1968, he was in the Embassy
Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.
Mr. JACQUES stated that he was not altogether sure on the
exact date of the shooting of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY but knew
that it was on a Tuesday night. He stated that he was in the
Embassy Ballroom with all of the other workers of the KENNEDY
contingent awaiting the arrival of ROBERT KENNEDY who was
scheduled to give a short address on his successful results
of the California primary election. He stated that he was
close to the stage located in the Embassy Ballroom and was
located on the righthand side of the stage platform which
is the opposite way from which Senator KENNEDY departed and
was subsequently shot. .

JACQUES observed the diagram which appeared in the
"Los Angeles Times" on June 6, 1068, and pointed to the

stage area of the diagram and ” indicated that he was located

on the lefthand side of the stage from the audience, which

would be the righthand side of the speaker's podium, He

stated that he was located at this position and that he observed
Senator KENNEDY after he addressed his campaign workers in

the Embassy Ballroom, start off the stage to the Senator's

right and then apparently the Senator decided against going

off into the crowd and shaking hands and turned and departed
leaving the stage from his lefthand side and then on into

the area that contained the kitchen and where he was then

shot.

Mr. JACQUES stated that he did not observe any-
thing of an unusual nature with regards to the individuals
seated in and around the Embassy Ballroom. He stated
that the persons in the room were quite jubilant and that
people were singing and cheering on Senator KENNEDY prior to

his arrival on the stage and as he departed. He stated that _

he did not observe any individual week he could consider
‘suspicious in the Embassy Ballroom. He noted that the
‘security forces in th2 hotel were quite lax inasmuch as
almost anyone could gain entry into the Embassy Pdlroom.

Mr. JACQUES stated that just prior to Senator
KENNEDY's entrance onto the stage he looked behind the
curtain which was located immediately to the rear of
the stage and observed two individuals there. One he
described as a Negro in his twenties who was dressed in
an institutional type of jacket with a white male dressed
in a similar type of attire. He stated that he surmised
that both of these individuals were part of the hotel staff
and were working there in some type of capacity.

Mr. JACQUES stated that he did meet someone
from Rhode Island who had a camera and was walking around
the area taking photographs of the various members of
the KENNEDY contingent and he stated that this individual
followed Senator KENNEDY as he departed from the stage
onto the area where he was later shot. He stated that he
could not recall the individual's name but stated that
he was some type of reporter connected with the radio
station WEAN,

Mr. JACQUES stated that he could not recall
specifically who he was with in the hall at the time
but noted that he was associating himself with the Young
Professionals for KENNEDY, which made up a larze portion
of the group at the victory party at the Embassy Ballroom
at that time. He stated that he was with a schoolteacher
- from California and he spent all of his time with her
but could not recall her name.

Miss ADRIENNE R. LEIB, Assistant Press Secretary
to the Mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, advised that she was a member
of the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY Campaign Staff and was at
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, the night of
June 4-5, 1968, when Senator KENNEDY was killed.

Miss LEIB volunteered the following information
regarding an incident which occurred the night before the
assassination and which she brought to the attention of other
staff members and the manager of the Ambassador Hotel after
the assassination. She admitted having a "wild imagination"
and said she did not know if the incident had any connection
with the assassination.

She reported that at approximately 1:00 a.m.
on June 4, 1968, after she and her roommate, Miss TAMSEN
BREDVOID, had gone to sleep, the telephone rang. Her roommate
answered the phone. The caller was a man, whose name Miss
LEIB does not recall. He identified himself as a newsman
and said he had just arrived at the hotel. He said he needed
a shave before the KENNEDY party arrived and wanted to know
if he could borrow a razor. Miss BREDVOID told the caller that
they did not have a razor. The man seemed persistent and
said he could come up to their room for the razor. He was
again told that they did not have a razor and was asked by
Miss BREDVOILD why he did not call a man to borrow a razor.
She caller said someone downstairs had suggested he call
their room. The conversation with this man then ended.

The next morning, June 4, 1968, there was a
discussion downstairs in the hotel between the hotel
manager and members of the KENNEDY staff concerning this
man, who had represented himself to the hotel as a member
of the KENNEDY staff and who had made numerous long dis-
tance telephone calls during the night and charged them
to the KENNEDY party. The manager was informed by mem-
bers of the KENNEDY staff that this man was not one of
them. The hotel manager then began to check on this man

and learned that he had already "skipped out" without
paying for his hotel room or the telephone calls.

Following the assassination of Senator KENNEDY,
Miss LEIB recalled the above incident and wondered if
it had any connection with the assassination. In con-
sidering this possibility, she observed that the room
she and Miss BREDVOLD shared at the Ambassador Hotel
was one of four which opened onto a lower roof of the
hotel. The room was believed to be on about the fourth
floor. She said it was possible for a person to walk out
onto the roof and look down on the entrance of the hotel.

Miss LEIB said she was curious as to why the
above mentioned man called their room, and if he had called
any of the other rooms which had access to the roof. This
was mentioned to the management, who then contacted the
occupants of these other rooms and learned that none of them
were in their rooms at 1:00 a.m. on the morning of June 4,
1968. Because of this, Miss LEIB surmised that the man called
their room because it was the only one whose occupants were
available and through which he would have access to the
roof overlooking the entrance.

Miss LEIB said another reason why the above incident
appeared strange to her was the fact that the caller said he
wanted to shave before the KENNEDY party arrived; when, in
fact, Senator KENNEDY and his party arrived earlier in the
evening at the hotel, and were in their rooms by 11:00 p.m.
that evening. This man also told her roommate when he called
that he was a newsman, but he told the hotel management that
he was with the KENNEDY staff. Miss LEIB felt that there was
something mysterious about this man because no one seemed
to know anything about him.

In connection with the assassination itself,

Miss LEIB said she was in the Embassy Room standing
near the television cameras when the shooting occurred, but

~ oh .


--- Page 30 ---
CV 175-16

she did not witness the shooting, nor did she hear the
shots. She learned of the shooting moments later during
the confusion when everyone was asked to leave the room.
At this point, she left the Embassy Room and returned

to her room in the hotel.

Miss LEIB said she did not know SIRHAN B. SIRHAN,
and did not recognize his photograph as anyone she had seen
around the hotel.

Miss LEIB again referred to her "wild imagination",
and said she had no information whatsoever that the man referred
to above was actually involved in the assassination. She
said she was relating this incident for whatever value it
might be to the investigative authorities.

Miss LEIB stated that her roommate, Miss TAMSEN
BREDVOLD, was not a member of the KENNEDY staff, but was
visiting in Los Angeles at the time and they roomed together
at the Ambassador Hotel. At the present time, she and
Miss BREDVOLD share an apartment at the Chesterfield
Apartments, 1801 East l@th Street, Cleveland, Ohio. She
thought perhaps Miss BREDVOLD would recall the name of this
man that made the above mentioned call.

Miss LEIB was also unable to recall the name of

the hotel manager, but said he had a Swedish name and
was tall with light colored hair.

Mr. DYER, who is currently employed in the Community
Relations Department, said that at the time of the shooting

Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, he had been assigned as a
photographer by KNXT-News and had been at the Ambassador

Mr. DYER said that he had not been a witness to
the actual shooting of Senator KENNEDY and others nor was

Mr. DYER advised that CBS had instigated a new
policy concerning the interviewing of CES personnel by
government investigators. In substance, this policy requires
that the employee, when approached, notify his department
head, and the question resolved as to whether the employee
should be interviewed, and if the employee was to be a
potential witness, a subpoena would be required before any

areremesive. information was given.

Mr, LANSING LAMONT, 5163 Tilden Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. (WDC), advised he is the national political
correspondent for Time, Incorporated, Suite 1200, 1120
Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

During the week of June 3-6, 1968, he was assigned
to the Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY campaign and was registered
staying at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

Mr. LAMONT advised he was in the Embassy Room of
the Ambassador Hotel during the time Senator KENNEDY was
giving his victory speech subsequent to the California primary
election.

Mr. JAMONT was to the left front of the podium as
he faced Senator KENNEDY during the speech. After Senator
KENNEDY fefnished speaking, he observed the Senator and his
party exit through a curtained doorway to the rear of the
podium, Mr. LAMONT then walked towards the television cameras
located at the rear of the Embassy Room and started towards
the corridor which would lead to the Colonial Room where the
Senator was to give a short press conference to members of
the writing press. As he neared the door leading to the
corridor, Mr. LAMONT heard loud shouting and screaming coming
from th® area near the podium. As the shouting grew louder,
he walked over in an effort to determine cause. It was
perhaps two or three minutes after Senator KENNEDY left the
speakers platform that this shouting began. He then determined
persons including Senator KENNEDY had been shot in the serving
kitchen area.

Mr. LAMONT said he entered the serving kitchen
area and observed Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor and
another man who was wounded lying almost head to toe to the
Senator.

Mr. LAMONT described the scene in the serving

see SIRHAN SIRHAN; however, he did recall what appeared to be
a group of men scuffling to the rear of where Senator KENNEDY
was lying.

Mr. LAMONT said he was assigned to the KENNEDY
campaign, had been with the campaign party during the weeks
preceéding the California Primary, and at no time did he

DARYL LEMBKE, 19 Sky View Way, San Francisco,
California, who is a reporter and Chief of the San Francisco
Bureau for the "Los Angeles Times", with offices at 905
Mission Street, San Francisco, furnished the following
information: ‘

LEMBKE was assigned to cover the campaign of the
late Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY in connection with the primary
in Oregon and California. As a result of this assignment,
he was in Los Angeles, California on June 4, 1968 when the
California primary elections were held.

On the night of June 4-5, 1968, LEMBKE was in the
Ambassador Hotel and in the Embassy Room of that hotel or the
Press Room adjacent to the Embassy Room most of the evening of
June 4, 1968. At the time the late Senator KENNEDY was shot,
LEMBKE was talking on a4 telephone located in a bank of
telephones in the Embassy Room. He heard some screams and

-ran over to see what had happened. He was told by some un-
known individual that Senator KENNEDY had been shot and he
observed a woman lying beside the podium in the Embassy Room
with blood on her head. He was unable to get into the serving
kitchen area outside the Embassy Room where the actual shoot-
ing of Senator KENNEDY had taken place.

LEMBKE is not acquainted with SIRHAN B. SIRHAN and
does not recall seeing anyone answering his description around
the hotel on the night Senator KENNEDY was assassinated. He
also has no knowledge which would indicate there was any con-
spiracy involved in the shooting of Senator KENNEDY.
