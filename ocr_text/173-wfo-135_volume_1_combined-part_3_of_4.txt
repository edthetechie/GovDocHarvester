Lookout for Woman in Polka Dots

Indictment Is Sought for Suspect

LOS ANGELES, June 7 UP) — A California

and risk the possibility that, like Lee Harvey

grand jury assembled today to cousider a request.._Oswald, Sirhan might himself Fall victim to an

for a murder indictment against Sirhan Sirhan,
the accused assassin of Sen. Robert ¥". Kennedy.

Sheriff’s officers tightened security at the Los
Angeles County jail in response to phoned threats
to storm the jail and kill the 24-year-old
Jordanian immigrant. They said the callers said
they would risk anything — even death — to
eliminate the man they believe killed Sen.
Kennedy.

Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess said Sirhan, captured
Wednesday morning at the Ambassador | hotel
after Sen, Kennedy was felled by a bullet in the
brain, remained outwardly calm and
waconcerned. The. slight, swarthy race track
exercise boy and health store stock clerk was

fined to a I2-by-12 windowless cell in the
refnote hospital wing of the downtown jail.

‘ONSTANT WATCH

dim ceiling light illuminated the gray wa
of the cell and the prison bunk he slept upon. A
wash basin and toilet were the only other
furnishings. An unarmed, uniformed deputy sat
cn a stool outside the cell and watched Sirhan’s
every move. A second armed depuly outside kept
his eyes glued on the suspect thru an unbreakable
glass porthole:

Four guards paced up and down a narrow
corridor outside. Other deputies patrolled every
nook and cranny of the jail complex.

The extreme concern over keeping Sirhan alive
convinced Dist. Atty. Evelle J. Younger to go to
the grand jury for the indiciment, rather than
following the normal procedure of filing a formal
murder complaint. wat lininary

ilia mplaint necessitates a prelim
hemi 2 courtroom proceeding that would have
reqiired Sirhan to be present. The grand jury
method carries no such equiament.

Nd law enforcement official here wants to™
transfer Sirhan from his tightly guarded jail cell

assassin before coming to trial.

The grand jury hearing may shed some light on
growing speculation that the man who shot
Kennedy may not have gone to the Ambassador
Hotel election party alone.

WOMAN SOUGHT

An all-points bulletin was in effect for a young
woman in a polka dot dress who ran from the
primary victory celebration shortly after Sen.
Kennedy was killed.

“We' shot him,’ a campaign worker said the
woman told her,

“Prior to the-shooting,”” according to the police
report, ‘suspect (Sirhan) was observed with a
female Caucasian described as 23 to 27 years, 5

with three-quarter sleeves and with small black
polka dots.”

The woman wore dark shoes and “bouffant
type hair.” °

“We don't think it was a conspiracy at this
time,” a police investigator said, “but we are not
going to throw anything into the wastebasket.”

Altho the grand jury proceedings are officially
secret, it was learned the DA’s office planned to
call 17 witnesses, including Assembly Speaker
Jesse Unruh, Sen. Kennedy’s California campaign
manager, and Olympic champion Rafer Johnson
and football player Roosevelt Grier, the two men
who disarmed and immobilized the suspect.

No members of Sen. Kennedy’s immediate fam-
ily were scheduled to appear.

Mr. Younger said the evidence should be pre-
sented by tonight, but he said it “might be a long
day.”

TRIAL IN 60 DAYS

[2 6 inches tall, wearing a white voile dress

cepg nlemattaignment, Sirhan has 10 days in which

fe a plea. California law requires the .DA’s
office to bring the defendant to trial within 60

&

Hf

days of his pleading, but the defense frequent
wins delays. .
Sirhan, a few hours after the shooting; was
arraigned on six coumts of assault with the intent
to commit murder and bail wag set at $250,000,
But the Senator’s death automatically made it
capital case, which is not bailable. :

Strict precautions were taken to make certain’
that Sirhan’s right to a fair trial would not be pre-
judiced by any misstep by the police or prosé-
cutors. He was repeatedly warned that hé. was.
not required to make a statement, and that if
he did make a statement voluntarily, {t would:be
used in evidence against him, Whether, due to the
warnings or to a desire to protect other ‘possible
conspirators, Sirhan remained silent regandiig
the case, altho he is reported to have talked
freely on other subjects, <

MAYOR YORTY i

been for mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles, one-ot
the nation’s most voluble politicians. os

" -

Mr, Yorty, a man for whom TV cameras exer-:
cise a deadly fascination, appeared twice in p
conferences after the shooting, and both tit
disclosed information thats legal purists mi
hold transgressed the newly defined rights of ad
cused criminals. Mr, Yorty’s indiscretions, it
is what they were, hinged on the disclosure: ¢
some of the contents of a journal Sirhan had:
kept. Mr. Yorty also extrapolated the conclusiéd.
that Sirhan had been subject to communist’ influ
ence because a car to which the suspect had.
access had been seen parked in front of @ pl+
where the communist-front W.E.B. DuBiois club,
hejd meetings. Subsequently, Mr. Yorty admits
thht he did not ‘now whether Sirhan was usi

car or nol at the time, but insisted that cul
te§ts of the man’s notebook showed unmistaka
communist influence,

[Sirhan Asks "Big Name" Lawyer

LOS ANGELES, June 10 (UPD — Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan has asked the American Civil Liberties
Union to help find a “big name’ Jawyer to defend
him against the charge of assassinating Robert
| F. Kennedy.

A. L, Wirin, noted constitutional Jawyer and
chief counsel of the Southern California ALCU,
has been visiting Sirhan daily in his cell and
planned to do so today.

This week Mr, Wirin will ask presiding judge
Richard Schauer of Los Angeles Superior Court to
_ call on the Los Angeles Bar Association and other
legal groups to obtain a defense altorney,

Superior Judge Arlhur Alarcon rejected Mr.
Wirin's Motion at the arraignment for “one or
more outstanding lawyers’ to be appointed to

lefend Sirhan but indicated he would reconsider

plea of guill or innocence was continued until
June 28, ‘

Sirhan has indicaled to Mr. Wirin he would
prefer to be defended by a private iawyer, altho
he is not opposed to Mr. Littlefield in particular.
Mr. Wirin hopes that a lawyer of the caliber of
Melvin Belli, who defended Jack Ruby in Dallas,
would be sought by the court.

HEAVY GUARD

Meanwhile, Sirhan remained under heavy
Buard in the second floor hospital ward of Central
Jail. Newspapers are distributed in the ward and
deputies said Sirhan probably had seen pholo-
fraphs of the funeral of the man he is accused
of killiag June 5.

residence. During the day ARWODI, accompanied by a number of
other Arab students, spent some time with the dinner guests
and entered into political discussions.  ARWODI and others
indicated deep hatred of Israel and expressed anti-U,. S.
sentiments because of our support of Israel. They also
indicated they were opposed to ROBERT KENNEDY especially
because he had backed Israel. Informant stated ARWODI and
the other students at no time made any threatening statements
in regard to KENNEDY but the comment was made that they hoped
he would not be President.

Informant said ARWODI is a student at American
University and apparently has his own apartment in Washington,
D. C.44is the head of an Arab student organization at American
University. Informant has not seen him since the above
incident, In addition, informant does not know the names
of any of the other Arab students he met on Thanksgiving
Day.

According to the informant, he realizes the
above information is nonspecific and that these students /
did not make threatening statempnts but he felt it advisable J

He requested that if either THOMAS or THELMA
KOUZES be contacted in this matter that utmost discretion
be used in order not to identify him or his spouse because
they are very close friends of this family and would
probably be the only ones beside the KOUZES who heard
these statements made.

PARIS June 11 (UP) — North Vietnamese diplo-

mats charged today that “gun merchants” with ,

financial interests in the Vietnam war may have
conspired in ‘‘a plot'' to eliminate Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy because he was a peace candidate.

The communist envoys admitted to newsmen
they had no proof for their assertions.

The Hanoi diplomats engaged’ in preliminary
talks with the United States have refused public
comment on the assassination, contending it was
an “internal American matter.” But in private

admitted shock.

refuse any concessions to start substantive baj-
gaining even if President Johnson ordered a

Memorandum

TO : SAC, WFO (173-135) DATE: 6/13/68
FROM: ROBERT H, SYLVESTER, Clerk
SUBJECT: KENSALT

During the evening jof 6/13/68 an individual who identi-
fied himself as MICHAEL HU 3636 16th St., N.W., Apt.
B-412, telephone 332-5817,/ telephoned WFO and advised as followr

*

He believes he may have seen SIRHAN SIRHAN, the accused
assassin of Senator KENNEDY, three or three and on-half years
ago at the Sheraton Park’Hotel, WDC, SULLIVAN said he recalls
an incident wherein a waiter with an explosive personality then
working at the hotel Mm became involved in an altercation with
another waiter, At the time SULLIVAN was working ‘as a security
officer at the hotel,

SULLIVAN stated it is his opinion the waiter with the
explosive personality may have been SIRHAN, He did not know
the waiter's name, but recalls he was a "rag head," which he
explainedis an individual from one of the near eastern countries,

ni

It was noted during his call that SULLIVAN's conversation
was rambling and occasionally incoherent. When he was asked to
repeat factshe had already furnished, he gave different details.
It was obvious that he had no specific information to indicate
the individual he allegedly saw was SIRHAN SIRHAN,

WFOfile 105-81551, captioned MICHAEL HARRY SULLIVAN,
IS —- R, appears ident with above-captioned complainant. A
copy of a LHM setting out background info re SULLIVAN is attached
to this memo, WFOfile 62~0-21894 concerns a MICHAEL A, SULLIVAN,
3636 16th St,, N.W., WDC, who called WFO to complain That some-
one broke into the apartment of his sister in Monterey, Calif.
SULLIVAN claimed the burglar was a narcotics agent, and he wanted
FBI assistance in obtaining evidence against him,

In view of the nonspecific nature of the information

furnished by SULLIVAN it is recommended no further action
e taken at this time,
