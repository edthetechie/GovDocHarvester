of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY. He advised that he was a KENNEDY
supporter and member of Senator KENNEDY's Local Speaker's Bureau
and he was present at the Ambassador Hotel on the night KENNEDY

was shot. He provided the following observations which occurred
at the Ambassador Hotel on the night of June 4, 1968.

He arrived at the Ambassador about 10:30 PM on
June 4, 1968. The guards at the door of the Embassy Room at the
Ambassador would not let him enter the room. He was told
that because of fire regulations they were unable to allow
anyone else to enter the room. He then went through the kitchen
in order to enter the Embassy Room. While he was going through
the kitchen he stated that he observed SIRHAN sitting on a table
in the kitchen. He stated he thought it was odd that SIRHAN was
in the kitchen because jhe was not nine as a kitchen employee
and he was dressed in "dirty" clothin He did not speak to
SIRHAN but remembered seeing him in passing through the kitchen
about 10:30 PM, June 4, 1068.

stated he had been an active worker for the
KENNEDY campaign in the Los Angeles area. He was with the
KENNEDY party on the Senator's visit to Watts and at the Greek
Theater and acted as a security man at the Greek Theater.

After he arrived in the Embassy Room he saw Mrs.

ms who invited him to join the private after-victory

ar which was for the campaign workers. About mid-night,
Senator KENNEDY came into the Embassy Room to make a short
speech. It was his understanding that the Senator would leave
through the crowd. Someone told him that Mrs. KENNEDY was
feeling faint, so KENNEDY decided to leave through the back
entrance and through the kitchen.

He Joined the KENNEDY group and was following them
through the "pantry door" which leat to the kitchen. Just before
he went through the door, he saw many balloons floating in the air.

Just as he entered the door, he heard what he assumed later
to be the first of several gun shots fired. At first, he
thought the noise he heard was caused by the exploding of the
balloons. When he realized that the noises he heard were gun
shots, he recalled hearing six (6) shots. He did not see any
person firing the shots. The last thing he remembered of
seeing Senator KENNEDY was his apparent efforts to protect
hims hr up his hands. His next recollection was
°° ai G and others trying to take a gun away from
Sst .

An unidentified woman shouted to him to "get a
doctor, the Senator has been shot." At this point, Il
ran from the kitchen into the Embassy Room searching for a
doctor. While running in the Embassy Room, he stated he
remembered seeing a caucasian female about twenty-five, 5'4",
126 pounds, moving toward the exit. This woman was wearing a
white dress with black polka dots and definitely had dark hair.
He did not say anything to this woman, nor did he hear her say
anything. He stated the only unusual thing he noticed about
this woman was the fact that she appeared much calmer than
anyone else in the room, and appeared to be trying to leave
the room as soon as possible.

While in the Embassy Room, searching for a doctor, a
man hurried past him in a furtive manner. He corld not describe
this man, but believed he was caucasian and carried a notebook.

t the Embassy room into the hall, he saw Mr.
J > whg is an insurance broker with an office on Crenshaw
oulevard. said to him, "My God--he run right through our
fingers." stated that the man to whom : a was
err was the same man who ran past him mentioned above.
ee his impression at the time that this man ran
past himwas that he was a newspaper reporter. He did not

give this man any additional thought, since he was sure that
the assassin was being subdued in the kitchen.

us side the Embassy Room entrance, he found
D > who is a Medical Doctor, and Doctor -_
M whom he said is a surgeon. He attempted to lead them back |

to the kitchen where Senator KENNEDY had been shot. At this
time security was extremely tight, and the guards at the Embassy
Room entrance would not let them into the room. After proper
identification, indicating that the three were doctors, the
guards let them into the Embassy Room. The three of them then
rushed back to the kitchen.

When they reached the kitchen, the ambulance was
already there tak care of Senator KENNEDY. The first thing
he saw was Mrs. lying against the wall with blood coming
from her head. e advised that he is not a medical doctor,
but a clinical psychologist, therefore, he did not administer
first aid to Mrs. anyone else. He did what he
could to help Doctor in administering emergency
treatment to the other victims of the assassin's bullets.

As additional ambulances arrived the various victims were
taken from the kitchen.

Shortly after he arrived back in the kitchen with
the doctors, the police had SIRHAN in their physical custody.
As they were taking him out of the kitchen into the main
hall, he heard SIRHAN say, "I did it, but I can explain. I
did it for my country.'

After all the victims had been taken away in
ambulances, there was still mass confusion in the kitchen and
the Embassy Room. He stated ABC and CBS reporters wanted him
to make a statement which he did. At this point, he advised
that he became extremely exhausted and wanted to go home. He
went into the Embassy Room and discovered that the police
would not let anyone leave. He went back to. the kitchen and
had one of the kitchen employees lead him out the back way.
He went to his car and went home.

In reflection, he remembered that every person he
thought to be an employee in the kitchen was dressed in white.
This is anotherreason he thought it strange to see SIRHAN in
the kitchen area earlier in the evening.

He estimated that the lapse of time from the shooting

until he left the hotel to go home was about thirty (30) minutes.
He arrived home between 1:30 and 2:00 AM.

At one point he looked back as was his
practice and saw that he was going in the correct
direction and Senator KENNEDY was about 12 feet behind
him and was chaking hands with one of -the kitchea
emplovees. He then lcoked forward and et that
moment he hesrd very sharp shots. He knew they were
shots and thinks that there were five of them in very rapid
succession. :

He turned his head and saw people reacting,
shouting and screaming. .

There was a crowd around Senator KENNEDY |

and _—— could not see everything clearly but he
thinks tha ac of Senator KENNEDY's staff, may have
knocked down KHAN SIRHAN once or. twice. Out of the
great crowd around Senator KENNEDY came another ~

smaller crowd. In this latter group was JR e red-
headed male membcor_of Senator KENNEDY's staff,. SIRHAN
SIRHAN and maybe BR : oa the red-head, and
maybe had SiRHAN. then turned back. :

to Senator KENNEDY who was lying on the floor.

gun. At this point, the red-head, and ¥
had SIRHAN by the arm. and had him over a steam table
trying to get the gun from his -hand. There may have .
been a_third party holding SIRNAN. At about this time,
thinks the gun came loose from STRHAN's
han ut SIRHAN recovered it immediately. There were
no shots fired. Things happened very fast and others
were helping to subdue SIHHAN. A man wearing a_seer
sucker jacket had hold of SIRHAN's leg and RA cy
had hold of SIRHAN,

The struggle for the gun-took a long time as
SIRHAN had a firm grip on it. With JJ§f the red-head
and HJ holding SIRHAN's wrist, a person who
thinks was GR got the gun out of SIRHAN's hand.

Mr. JT UL ees of the California

State Assembly,
California, furnished the following information:

On June 4, 1968, he was on the fifth floor of
the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, along
with members of his staff and Senator KENNEDY and his
staff, awaiting the results of the California Presidential
Primary. People in the room off the main lobby, who were

awaiting the arrival of Senator EDY, began to get restless
and it was suggested that he ( go down to speak to
them.

At about 11:30 p.m. he went down and spoke to the
group. At approximately 11:45 p.m. he felt there were
sufficient returns for Sen KENNEDY to claim victory and
sent his assistant, Mr. —_ Ci” to get the Senator
and his party.

The Senator came down to the hall and addressed the
group congregated there for about eight minutes * °- and then
started to walk away. He proceeded to his right, towards a
table where P a 2 DEK BMJ were seated. He
was propelled, by someone whom he could not see, ds the
back of the stage. The stage was so jammed he ( de-
cided to go down the stairs from the stage and go to the
hallway by the door located at the foot of the stage -

When he stepped out into the hallway Senator KENNEDY
had already passed that area and was about ten paces ahead
of him. He then heard two or four pops followed by four or
five more. At this point he did not realize these were pistol

shots and thought they might be balloons. All at once

the crowd parted in front of_him as he continued to walk
forward. He then observed PE SHEE. ying on the floor
with an obvious bullet wound in his head and immediatel
noticed Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor ahead of _—,
Senator KENNEDY brought his hand down from his head and
appeared to clutch at his stomach, hence he believed the
Senator had been shot there. Someone had already gotten

to the Senator and had undone his shirt.

Inasmuch as the crowd was pressing in, his first
thoughts were to make room for the Senator and prevent his
being trampled on. He then attempted to push newsmen,
photographers, and other people in the area_away, Noticing
a photographer on top of a table where as had
pinned SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, he pulled him off thi le
and into the corridor. At this point it was the first time
he had seen SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and at no time did he
ever observe SIRHAN holding the gun.

Recalling the fate that had befallen LEE HARVEY
OSWALD,and hearing voices in the crowd yelling to kill
SIRHAN,he recalls yelling to the group holding SIRHAN to
protect him. He could not recall exact words used but,
remembering the events in Dallas when OSWALD had been Shot ,
he did not want to see the same thing happen there. He
did recall saying something like, | a the system works at
all, we are going to try this one"

When the police arrived he attempted to keep the
police all around SIRHAN . . to protect him. He .--
grabbed SIRHAN by the scruff of the neck and helped to
propel him down the hallway through the lobby and to a police
car parked in front of the hotel.

He accompanied the police officers in the car that

SIRHAN was in to the Rampart Division. He sat in front with
the driver and SIRHAN was in the back seat between two other

police officers. About the time they entered the car
SIRHAN mumbled, " I did it for my country". He could not
recall at just what point he c . asked the question
during the ride, but since SI ooked like a Latin-Amer-
ican he asked SIRHAN, “Why him? Why him? He was trying
to do something". SIRHAN muttered, "It's too late, it's
too late". He also recalls SIRHAN saying, "I can explain,
I can explain". He could not, however, recall the exact
sequence of the statements except for the one made as they
entered the car.

They arrived at the Rampart Division and SIRHAN
was taken into a room there by one of the officers. His
sole concern there was that SIRHAN not be in a position
to do himself any harm and he was assured by an officer
that SIRHAN was still handcuffed and would not be able to
do himself any harm. Shortly after their arrival at the
Rampart Division he noticed the time was 12:43 a.m.

SIRHAN subsequently was brought out, placed into
a police car, and taken to the Central Division. He followed
in another car. <° Upon arriving SIRHAN was taken to
an isolation room and interrogated and that is all he saw
of SIRHAN.

He added that he was not aware of any formal
plans for Senator KENNEDY to address the press. The only
plan he was aware of was that there was to be a victory
celebration at the "Factory" a discotheque in Hollywood,
California, to which he and his staff had been invited. To
his Knowledge all plans were made by the Senator's staff.
