President Lyndon B. Johnson
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20310

Dear Mr. President:

Like all other people I am stricken with grief over the attempted
assination of Senator Kennedy.

I feel strongly that emphasis on this event and others is being place
improperly. True, stricter gun control laws are needed, but I feel

the problem is much deeper. Many people are saying that the American
people are sick, sick people. I strongly believe that these assinations
and attempted assinations..over the years are “Communist inspired. This
~jhaybe a false analogy but what better way is there to make the US
appear chaotic at home as well as in our foreign affairs - especially
Vietnam. When other nations see these things happening they must think
that the United States is incapable of running its domestic affairs,
thus causing many to lose faith in democracy itself.

Thank you for your kind attention.
I would appreciate an answer to this letter by anyone.

Sincerely yours,

Alda? F. ibe,

Gilbert F. Tiberio, Jr.
