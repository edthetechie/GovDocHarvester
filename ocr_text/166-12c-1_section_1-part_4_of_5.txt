UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

- June 6, 1968

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

“a

This is to advise that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Jordanian
national, has been identified as the individual who shot Senator Robert F.
Kennedy at 12:15 a,m,, Pacific Daylight Time, June 5, 1968, in the
ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel at Los Angeles, California, The

-Senator subsequently died at 1:44 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, June 6,

1968, at the Good Samaritan Hospital, Los Angeles.

After the assailant was taken into custody by authorities, he
refused to identify himself or otherwise discuss this matter, He was -
shortly thereafter charged by the Los Angeles Police Department with
intent to commit murder and held on $250, 000 bond.

His brother, Adel Sirhan, notified authorities as to Sirhan's
true identity. The FBI subsequently identified Sirhan’s fingerprints as
being identical with those of an individual by the same name which were
submitted by the California State Horse Racing Board during 1965.

According to the Lios Angeles Police Department, the weapon
used in the assassination was an eight~shot , 22 caliber Iver Johnson
pistol, All eight shots were expended, Records of the California
Department of Justice show this pistol to have been sold on August 10,
1965, to one Albert Leslie Hertz of Alhambra, California, Ikwas
subsequently traced by police authorities through several parties to one

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, according to records of the Immi-
gration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles, California, was born
on in Jerusalem, Palestine. His current address was Pll
given as 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, California. Immigration
and Naturalization Service records show he entered this country on
January 12, 1957, with his father, Bishara Salameh Ghattas Sirhan, his
mother, Mary, four brothers and a sister who is now deceased. His
brothers, Adel, Munir, and Saidallah, are currently shown as residing
with their mother and Sirhan at 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, *
California. The fourth brother, Sharif, is a resident of Highland Park,
California. His father allegedly resides now in Jordan,

Our Los Angeles Office reports that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan
graduated from high school in Pasadena, California. He thereafter
attended Pasadena City College, a junior college, for approximately two
years, but did not graduate. He formerly worked as a race horse
exercise boy and during September, 1966, sustained a head injury after
falling from a horse. Interviews with his family indicate his behavior
has changed considerably since this injury. Records of the State of
California reveal he was awarded a settlement on March 27, 1968, in -~
the sum of $2,000. His brother, Adel, advised the assailant has been
unemployed for the past three months. When taken into custody he had
$409 in cash on his person. . .

During a search of his room in the Pasadena family home
numerous items, including notations advocating the overthrow of the
President of the United States and statements alluding to the necessity .
for assassinating Robert F. Kennedy, were found. According to United
States Attorney William Matthew Byrne, Jr., Central District of
California, who had been in contact with the office of the Los Angeles
County District Attorney, this material should not be disclosed publicly
prior to the trial nor should it be made available to unauthorized persons
since it could have a serious adverse effect upon successful prosecution
in either Federal or State court. One handwritten page bearing the date
May 18, 1968, 9:45 a. m., contains numerous notations among which
are ''My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of
an unshakeable obsession." "RFK must die - RFK must be killed.
Robert F, Kennedy must be assassinated." Another page contains the
handwritten statement that The so-called President of the United States


--- Page 6 ---
ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

of America will be advised of their punishments for their treasonable
crimes against the state. More over we believe that the glorious United
States of America will eventually be felled by a blow of an assassin's
bullet." .

A third page contains the following statement. "Ambassador
Goldberg must die die die."' Repeated numerous times on this same page
appears "Goldberg will be illiminated, "

Page four contains the statement "Kennedy must die - Kennedy .
must fall," which is repeated numerous times,
---Page five contains the statement’ that "RFK must be disposed
of like his brother was. "

The statement "I advocate the overthrow of the current
President of the (obscene) United States of America. I have no absolute
plans yet - but soon will compose some" appears on page six.

Page seven contains the statement "Well, my solution to this
type of Govt. today is to do away with its leaders and declare anarchy, _ -,
the best form of Govt. or no Govt." :

On page eight appears the statement "I believe that I can effect
the death of Bert C. Altfillisch, '' who was the employer of Sirhan at the.
time he was thrown from a horse during September, 1966.

Also appearing was the notation "Robert F. Kennedy must be_
assassinated before 5 June 68."

In addition, a source who has furnished reliable information
in the past and who is an active member of the Communist Party in
California advised that he received information from an associate of
Sirhan's to the effect he was extremely anti-Semitic in his views, was
in favor of the Vietcong and supported some Communist Party ideals.’
Sirhan, according to this source, had been thoroughly briefed on
Communist Party activities at the University of California at Los Angeles
within the last two weeks. ” Although it was reported to this source that
an attempt had been made to recruit Sirhan into the Communist Party,
Sirhan allegedly has not engaged in any Communist Party activities.

Sir:

It is my scarnest belief that the s rity of our
country is rectly involved in the as sination of
Senator Robert Kennedy, and that these security interests
require a thorough interregation of the suspect, Sirhen
Bishare Sirkan, by you and your staff.

ecu
Sas

I base my contention the following considerations.
fiest, Siren is quoted as shouting et the time of the
shooting, "TI did it for my country." Since hs hag never
becone s citizen of the United States, his Loyalty is
cbvicusly dirzcted elsewhere. Second, four hunered dollars
sere found in his possession at the tine of capture, a
sum that strcengly survests that he had been subsidized.
+nird, a Woman was seen in his company prior to the
shooting, and afterward she is said to have bousted of
the crime. Fourth, Fadeeyan (guerilla) units have sprung
up in great numbers throughout Jordan, avd their raids
into Israel have multiplied. Since these activities have been
amply financed by the oil vroducing states, the possibil-
ity of an international Arab conspiracy cannot be dis-

sed out of hand.

sclding the key to this mystery is the prisoner
Sirhan. Vvertainly he must not be allowed to carry such
crucial secrets to his grave as Os d did. Certainly
tne United States, which hes already lost so much at his
hands, dare net risk losing more of its valued leaders
through the failure of extracting from Sirran all he
knows.

In view cf his intransigence, I believe that hypnotic
drugs such as sodium pentothel should be administered
to fnecilitete the eliciting of informetion. If this
information is withheld from tne courts, but used instead
as a means for avprehending collaborators if they exist,
the prosecution egainst him shoulda not be hampered or
uvejudiced in any a a i; oe |

Dear Mrs. Bell:. , ,

The Attorney General has asked me to thank you
for your letter concerning his statements on the
assassinations of Senator Kennedy and Dr, King.

Let me assure you that Mr. Clark has not made
the statements which you attribute to him. He ©
has never ruled out a conspiracy in either case
but has pointed out on several occasions there Was
no evidence of conspirdcy. This is still true.

. He did not announce "an imminent capture’ of the
. Killer of Dr. King, but expressed his hope and
confidence that the killer would be apprehended.

Sincerely,

Cliff Sessions
Director of Public: Information.

Ramsey Clark,

U. S. Attormey General
Attorney Generals Office
Washington, D, C,

Dear Sir:

I was deeply shocked and upset this morning by your statements made
after the shooting of Senator Robert Kennedy. I realize you are
under tremendous pressures in fulfilling your duties as Attorney
General but you do the country and the people a grave injustice when
you make unsubstantiated statements during a crisis. You probably
Wish to reassure the people, but all you do is make them fearful and
doubtful of you.

I refer to your statements following the assassination of Rev. King
and again following the shooting of Senator Robert Kennedy. In both
instances, before you could possibly have had time to make any kind
of investigation, you went on the air to announce "There was no
organized conspiracy". In the case of Dr. King, you went further
and announced an imminent capture of the killer, when you must have

been aware this was poppycock.

You insult the intelligence of the people and create doubt with these
irresponsible utterings. I would strongly urge, for the future, that
no public statement be made until you can tell us the truth.

The people of our country are confused enough without adding to the
turmoil - what we want now is TRUTH, not blandishments. And you can
not tell the truth without the facts. And you cannot make up facts =
you have to establish them upon investigation.

Yours very truly,
a

Ruth Bell
