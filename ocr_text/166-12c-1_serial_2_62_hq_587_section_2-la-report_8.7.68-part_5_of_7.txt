as the suspect in the KENNEDY shooting. She said that
ANTOINETTE became very upset and began to weep. ANTOINETTE

was on his way home. She advised that about 3:15 to 3:30
p.m. SHARIF SIRHAN arrived home and went immediately to the
pack of the house. SHARIF asked the police to keep the press
and spectators away as he would not speak to any of them.

She said she and ANTOINETTE accompanied SHARIF to the back

of the house and it was at this time she was introduced to
SHARIF, whom she had never met before. She stated the police
officers, who were with them, did not question SHARIF
regarding the whereabouts of the family. She stated the
house was locked and SHARIF had no key. She said an officer
advised them to enter the house or else leave the premises in
view of the fact the press was there with numerous spectators,
She said SHARIF did not want to leave as it would cause great
concern to his mother.

She said an officer lifted her up so that she could
enter a side window which was found to be unlocked. She then
went to the back door and let SHARIF and ANTOINETTE into the
house. They immediately drew the shades in the house. She
stated that within a few minutes two women arrived at the house
and SHARIF let them in as they were friends of the STRHAN
family. She said that ANTOINETTE knew both of the women she
let in through the back door of the house. She said that the
telephone rang many times with both crank calls and calls from
sympathetic people. She said she became very upset with the
environment of the confusion and drawn shades. She said she

she obtained a babysitter in her apartment house to care for
her son and then she returned to the SIRHAN residence in
Pasadena.

house alone when COREY returned. She said a policeman
told her todrive around the block and park on Ladera
Street and he would see that ANTOINETTE would meet her there.
She said they then drove over to friends of the SIRHAN family
on Sacramento Street, address not recalled. She said that when
they arrived there, two patrol cars were parked on the same
block near the house where the SIRHANs were staying. She
said that SHARIF came out of the house to tell them that
ADEL and his mother were in the house being questioned by
detectives and that we should not come in the house.
ANTOINETTE asked SHARIF to have ADEL call her if he wanted to
do so.

COREY stated they then drove to a drive-in nearby
in Pasadena and had dinner. She said that following dinner
they drove back to ANTOINETTE's apartment and arrived there
about 9:00 p.m. She said that about 10:00 p.m. three plain-
clothes policemen knocked at the door and were let in. She
said they searched ANTOINETTE, NABIL, the maid NELLIE BIANCA,
and herself for weapons and placed them under arrest for
attempted murder. . She said they exhibited badges but no
other identification card. She said that she gave them somewhat
of a bad time until they had exhibited an identification card.
She said that a little later on two other detectives in
business suits came into the apartment. Thefirst three
officers took ANTOINETTE, NABIL and COREY to the Rampart
Division while the other two detectives stayed to search the
apartment. The maid, NELLIE, remained to care for ANTOINETTE's

On July 1, 1968, ALI KALLA, 1750 North Sycamore
Street, Apartment 308, Los Angeles, was interviewed at his
emp Loyment as operator of the Texaco Service Station, 1400
South Alameda Street, Los Angeles. He stated he had been one
of the owners of the Shakers Oasis Bar at 6756 Hollywood
Boulevard, Los Angeles, and while this was in operation, ADEL
SIRHAN had worked for him as an entertainer, playing a musical
instrument, and sometimes tending bar. KALLA said SIRHAN
STRHAN never came to the bar to drink or watch the enter--
tainment, but would periodically stop by as the bar was closing
to visit ADEL. KALLA said a group which included JESSE
KARADSHEH and MAROON MANSOUR would then go out for breakfast
and talk. KALLA said SIRHAN was always quiet and reserved,
and had very little to say. He was pleasant, but did not talk
much, KALLA said the group never discussed politics or the
situation in the Middle East, since they all thought much the
same way on the subject, and there was no point in discussing
it. He stated the common belief of all the Arabs of his
acquaintance was that a great injustice had been done the
Arabs by the formation of the State of Israel, and all were
bitter about the expropriation of their land and property
and their expatriation. He said it was such a common belief
that it was very rarely discussed unless an outsider wanted
to discuss it.

KALLA stated that to his knowledge, SIRHAN never
associated regularly with other Arabs, but came to the club
to meet his brother. He said SZRHAN never talked about any
Arab groups or clubs, including student groups, to his knowledge.

KALLA stated he and other friends would occasionally
meet SIRHAN at the race track, wherever he happened to be, in
the hope of getting tips on the races. He said another man
who appeared to know SIRHAN fairly well through the race track
was one MAHOUD STYAM, commonly known as MIKE. He stated he
did not have SIYAM's address, but would get his telephone
number at home and furnish it at a later date.

SIMONE E. SIMANN, Owner and Operator, Shell Service
Station, Avenue 26 and Figueroa Street, Highland Park,
California, furnished the following information:

He is not acguainted with SIRHAN SIRHAN, however, he
does know ADEL SIRHAN, the brother of SIRHAN SIRHAN, inasmuch
as ADEL would stop by the trucking business SIMANN briefly
operated in Pasadena during 1961. This was shortly after
SIMANN arrived in this country from Jordan and he and ADEL have
naintained a casual acquaintanceship to this day.

SIMANN recalls seeing ADEL SIRHAN in the Fez Restaurant,

Hollywood, approximately five days before the shooting of
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, At that time, ADEL SIRHAN was dining
in the company of four or five other Arabs, none of whom were
known by SIMANN, and SIMANN overheard ADEL bitterly complaining

' about the support for Israel Senator KENNEDY had expressed
during the Oregon primary. ADEL was upset that Senator KENNEDY
was cultivating the Jewish vote in the United States, however,
SIMANN did not hear ADEL SIRHAN threaten Senator KENNEDY in
any manner.

SIMANN is of the opinion that ADEL was exasperated
with Senator KENNEDY and may have passed some of this bitterness
to his younger brother, SIRHAN STRHAN.

SIRHAN, the brother of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. He stated that
ADEL was working at the Fez as a musician at that time.

YOUNG advised that ADEL became @ good friend of hers
and that he wed to take her home after work quite often, out
for breakfastand on other. social engagements. She state d that
approximately one year after having met ADEL, he introduced her
to one of his brother's,who was at the Fez Restaurant, and to her

this individual about two more times, each time at the Fez
Restaurant. Ths lest time was approximately April 1968,

YOUNG advised that during the time she knew ADEL, she
never had any occasion to discuss politics with him and she never

stated that she knew ADEL to be a kind,generous person and thought
8 great deal of him.

She said that in her few encounters with ADUL's brother,

discussing anything such as politics or ideologies. She stated
thet she never remembers his brother to display any sign of temper
or violence in her presence.

She stated that she left the employ of the Fez Restaurant
earlier thisyear inasmuch as she was of a Jewish background and
she did not wish to put up with some of the comments or insults
of some of the Arab patrons of the restaurant. She said that the
upper floor of the Fez Restaurant was a very pro-Arab nationalist
environment. ' On the night that Senator KENNEDY was
assassinated, several of the individuals there,whom she did not
know by name, indicated that they were glad that the "Jewish lover"
was dead. She stated also that she sensed, among many of the Arab
people at the Fez,the strong feeling of anti-Americanism.

that he recalled the incident in July 1967 involving
SIRHAN SIRHAN attempting to apply for a job which was
offered through the Distributive Education and Placement
Service at the college. Dr. LEWIS stated that he had not
remembered the matter during prior interviews because of
the number of students with whom he deals. Dr. LEWIS’ stated
that he first became involved when SIRHAN went to the office
of the President at the college to mace a complaint but that
SIRHAN was referred to his office because the Placement Service
had been placed under his supervision about a month earlier.
Dr. LEWIS stated that he could not really remember the
particulars of the meeting but that he did have SIRHAN fill
out a second application card and then sent SIRHAN back to
the employment office. Dr. LEWIS stated that he believed
he had telephoned the office suggesting that they give
SIRHAN the job information SIRHAN requested, even though
SIRHAN did not meet the requirements for educational back-
ground or physical requirements.

Dr. LEWIS stated that he kept a journal from day
to day noting matters cut of the ordinary which arise.
Dr LEWIS referred to this journal, where under the date
July 24, 1967, was the notation:

"saw SIRHAN ~ noted job 604, Retail Management
Trainee, Permanent Resident Visa, Dr. LEWIS okay to
Re apply for job-113c”.

Dr. LEWIS stated that each job opening is given a
number, which is probably reflected by "job 604." He further
stated that "Permanent Resident Visa" is probably a reference
to the fact that when foreign students apply for positions
the number of hours they can work are limited by their type
of visa and therefore SIRHAN would have had to been asked
what his status was for this reason.

just general interest, because this was the area of his origin.

indicated to RATHKE he was unhappy over this. RATHKE stated
these were the only two times the Rosicrucian Order was
mentioned by SIRHAN and they never discussed the Rosicrucian
Order as such regarding its philosophies or aims.

RATHKE stated the Theosophical Society is a world-wide
organization with world headquarters in Adyar, Madras, India
and the United States headquarters in Wheaton, Illinois where
the society also has a publishing house.

RATHKE stated aims of the society are to build the
idea of the brotherhood of man without regard to color, sex
or religion and to further the study and research of all
philosophies of religion. The society is made up of individuals
of all religions and at meetings the members discuss their
various religions and philosophies.

From newspapers, television or radio broadcasts, RATHKE
learned SIRHAN had requested books written by Madam BLAVOTSKY
(Phonetic), C.W. LEADBEATER (Phonetic) both of whom have
written books for the Theosophical Society and both of whom are
now deceased. Madam BLAVOTSKY was born in Russia and moved to
New York City where she became a co-founder of the society and
LEADBEATER was a Bishop of the Church of England. At this time
RATHKE also learned Madam BLAVOTSKY at one time had written a
book on the lives of revolutionaries which he had not known

before.

THOMAS DANIEL GOOD, 22 South 11th Street, San Jose, Califor-
nia 95112, was interviewed in the San Francisco Office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San
Francisco, California, on June 14, 1968. GOOD voluntarily appeared
accompanied by his attorney, AUBREY GROSSMAN, who was present during
the interview.

GOOD related that he is unemployed and is a student at San
Jose State College, San Jose, California. His parents are ROSCOE
WAYNE and INEZ GOOD, who reside at_1364 Elizabeth Street, Pasadena,
California 91104. He was born on 5 at Altadena, Cali-~ Pil
fornia.

GOOD furnished the following information concerning the indi-
vidual whose photograph appeared in local newspapers, identified
as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, reported assassin of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY:

He first met this individual at John Muir High School, Pasadena
California, in what he recalls to have been the 1962-63 school
year when he was in the llth grade. This individual was known to
him only as SIRHAN, with no other names recalled. He believes he
first heard of SIRHAN at Social Science class during a discussion
on the question of politics. During this discussion some student
suggested that he felt they should hear from SIRHAN on his views
since the discussion, as recalled by GOOD, involved the Middle East.
He thereafter became an acquaintance of SIRHAN and never did con-
sider him what he would term a friend. He thereafter visited in
SIRHAN's home on approximately three occasions, and on one occasion
SIRHAN visited in GOOD's home. GOOD recalled that he went on a
picnic with SIRHAN's mother and a sister who is now deceased. Also
present at this picnic were a Mrs. HAYWARD, address unknown, and
some members of her family. Mrs. HAYWARD reportedly knew Mrs.
SIRHAN from church attendance, and he recalled that Mrs. HAYWARD
was also a friend of his parents.

As GOOD recalls, he last saw SIRHAN in 1964. He remembers
SIRHAN as a student at Pasadena City College for at least one
semester during the time GOOD attended from the Fall of 1963 until

July, 1965. GOOD was a member of the Young Democrats at Pasadena
City College. He was unaware of any other political organizations
and does not know what groups or organizations SIRHAN belonged to,
if any. He recalled that SIRHAN had some contact with other Arab
students but he had no knowledge if there was any formal group or
organization among such students. He stated there was a large
group of Arab students attending Pasadena City College at that time.
GOOD stated he was unable to.furnish any information concerning
SIRHAN's political views but recalled him as being very anti-Israel,
He was aware that SIRHAN came from Palestine and attributed his
feeling toward Israel to his national origin.

GOOD is acquainted with one WALTER CROWE and recalled that
CROWE was a friend of SIRHAN. He related that CROWE met SIRHAN
when the latter first came to the United States. CROWE also attend-
ed elementary school with SIRHAN and later John Muir High School.
He stated that he knew of no contacts between CROWE and SIRHAN out-
side the context of the school. CROWE mentioned SIRHAN to GOOD on
more than one occasion but never commented on the political beliefs
of SIRHAN.

GOOD related that he never heard SIRHAN express his feelings
regarding the KENNEDY family or any other Government official. He
stated that he recalled the reactions of numerous friends to the
assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY but does not recall the
reaction of SIRHAN to this event. He stated there was nothing in
his acquaintance with SIRHAN on which he could base any motive for.
his action in this case. He recalled SIRHAN as a very distant
individual, no matter how friendly one became with him. He
recalled him as an individual who seemed to be alienated from
people in general, even from other Arabs, and WALTER CROWE appeared
to be his only friend and this friendship was not a close one. He
stated he:never detected any strain of violence in SIRHAN, but, ‘to
the contrary, remembered once when he was: visiting in the SIRHAN
home there was adeafmute or blind girl also present and SIRHAy
seemed very gentle to her.

GOOD related that of the many Arab students who attended

Pasadena State College with whom he was acquainted, SIRHAN had
stronger ideas of Arab nationalism than any of the others.

Mrs, ERNESTINE GARCIA, 452 North Hill Street,
Pasadena, California, mother. of IVAN GARCIA, friend of
SIRHAN SIRHAN, was contacted at her employment as an
accountant at the Los Angeles Drug Company, 5001 Earle
Street, Rosemead, California. Mrs. GARCIA stated she knew
SIRHAN slightly during the time IVAN GARCIA was attending
Pasadena City College with SIRHAN. She said he had visited
at her house on perhaps a half dozen occasions, however,
he primarily visited her son, and she had no lengthy
conversations with him, She said they never discussed
his political or philosophical views. She said she was
aware that SIRHAN had tried to become a jockey and got
the impression that SIRHAN was possibly self-conscious of
his small stature, and understood he may have received
counseling that he should try to become a jockey. She
said the last time she saw him, he had been injured ina
fall from a horse and appeared quite discouraged and
frustrated, and indicated he probably would not become a
jockey but would remain an exercise boy, Mrs. GARCIA
said she could not recall when this occurred but believed
she last saw SIRHAN about two years ago.

Mrs. GARCIA stated she had never met any other
members of SIRHAN's family and knew nothing further concerning
him, excepting she always considered him to be very polite
and very quiet,

On June 20, 1968, IVAN GARCIA, who refused to furnish
his home address, was contacted at Pasadena City College,
Pasadena, California. He stated he was regularly employed from
6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturdays and
Sundays at Allied Auto Parts, 1060 East Colorado Boulevard,
Pasadena (793-1893), and could be contacted through his
employment if necessary. He stated his mother was highly
nervous and did not want her disturbed.

GARCIA stated he was a national of Guatemala. He stated
he had known SIRHAN SIRHAN for approximately four years, having
met him in class at Pasadena City College. GARCIA
stated he had visited SIRHAN's home and had dinner there,
had met ADEL STRHAN and SIRHAN's mother, all of whom he
regarded highly.

He stated he considered SIRHAN to be extremely
polite, sensitive and thoughtful. He stated he thought
SIRHAN's generosity and unselfishness toward his friends
was very unusual, and was his most outstanding virtue.

He said SIRHAN would do everything to make a guest or friend
comfortable and at ease, and usually insisted upon paying
bills wherever he went with friends, although he did not
have a particularly large sum of money at any time.

GARCIA stated he and SIRHAN did not discuss politics,
partly because GARCIA did not like to discuss them, and partly
because his and SIRHAN's interests were more scholastic
and social. SIRHAN did not appear to be particularly aware of
any political party, was not interested in groups or being
a leader, and was not openly fanatical about politics. He
said SIRHAN was highly individualistic in his ideas,. and did
not follow the crowd or fads.

SIRHAN never discussed Senator KENNEDY, the
Arab-Israeli dispute, or racial recriminations which
might have arisen out of such a dispute. The closest
SIRHAN ever came to discussing anything racial was
when he discussed the possibility of his becoming a jockey,
which he desired very greatly, probably because of his
size and the possibility of being a success in this
endeavor. SIRHAN stated that many of the people for whom
he would work as a trainer were of Jewish background, and
STRHAN felt that his advancement as a jockey might be
hampered because of the feelings of Jewish people concerning
those of Arab origin.

Regarding women, GARCIA stated SIRHAN did not
appear to have a strong interest in them, and never mentioned
having dates or other social contact with women. SIRHAN
was more idealistic and humanitarian, and seemed to love
people in general.

GARCIA stated he did not see SIRHAN on June 4,
and stated his contacts with SIRHAN had not been so numerous
in recent months because of the different hours each worked,
and the fact that SIRHAN was no longer in school.

GARCIA stated SIRHAN had never expressed an interest
in firearms, and he had never seen him with a gun of any
kind. GARCIA considered a gun foreign to SIRHAN's nature,
which appeared to be generally peace loving.

GARCIA stated he had noticed a very definite change
in SIRHAN after his accidental fall from a horse. SIRHAN
had been much more jovial before the accident, and seemed
to be more gloomy and pessimistic about his future afterwards.
SIRHAN believed he was through as a jockey, and did not seem
so ambitious after the accident. GARCIA commented upon the
monetary settlement SIRHAN had received from his accident, and
stated he was sure this was the source of the money SIRHAN
had on his person when arrested. He stated that shortly after
