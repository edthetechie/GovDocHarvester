Dialogue
with youth,

By Erwin D. Canham
Editor in chief of

was shocking
in its implications and your reply was
exactly right.

However, ny reevaluation ofthe leest
ftatua of “marijuana by your readers
should certainly take into account a state-
ment by Dr. Stanley Einstein, executive
director of the Institute for the Study of
Addiction, as quoted in a recent issue of
McCall's:’ “No drugs are safe—not even
marijuana. All drags, including pot, ca
cause disorientation in even a alightly un-
stable personality: when you deal with
drugs you can never predict consequen-
ces. Particularly, you can't predict which
mug experimenter will get hooked.”

T recently attended a business iuncheon
at which a Professor of Pharmacy from
Ohio Northern University was the princl-
pal speaker. In commenting on the grave

langers attending drug addiction he aid:
‘With 17 million Americans today who
are suffering from some form of mental
illness there is an urgent need for more
Tigid laws to control the use of euch
drugs as marijuana and LSD which can
take the user over the borderline into
ayehos

In view of the fact that drugs are being
vigorously pushed in virtually every high
school and college in the country you cane
not over-emphasize this danger in your
Dialogue with Youth column.

Roy A. F.

Cleveland Hts., Ohio

E. D. C.: Iam grateful for these authorita-
tive quotations. It is certainly true that
drags are being “pushed” in and around
just about every high schoo! and college
in the United States, and in some other
parts of the world as well. The motives
are vicious. We must Indeed help people
to awaken to the dangers,

By Thelma Winkler Orenstein

Danny Kaye is a chameleon, buffoon,

philosopher, “‘an honorable man.” He is
truly a delight.

Compassion is one of his admirable char-
acteristics. Kindness is another of his qual-
ities—taking precious time, for instance,
from. an incredibly taxing schedule, to in-
sure that a teen-ager’ traveling alone is
seated beside him. Snobbery certainly isn't
one of his attributes: he treats his employ-
ees as associates. When he's fatigued, he
confesses he becomes difficult and some-
what “crabby.” But relaxed and rested,
he's extremely friendly and spontaneous.

‘The term “glamour boy," as Hollywood
defines it, doesn’t fit him. His real person-
ality-is rather an intithesis of his tole a
a relaxed entertainer. He is serious about
‘his work to the point of perfection and self-
sacrifice,

Mr. Kaye is a tireless supporter of many:
deserving organizations, especially those
connected with children. His face lights
up when he talks about various experiences
hhe has had with children around the world.

Last summer, after spending five weeks
entertaining wounded soldiers in Israel,
‘Mr. Kaye made a hospital tour of Southeast
Asia and a short visit to Expo. He then
covered more than a dozen cities for the
United Nations Intemational Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) for which he
has worked for 14 years. Every October
Mr. Kaye flies his own plane throughout
the United States and Canada for the bene-
fit of UNICEF's annual ‘trick or treat" pro-
gram, In 1965, when UNICEF was named
the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Danny.
Kaye was requested to accept the honor
for them.

In addition to UNICEF and the United
Jewish Appeal, he entertains regularly
for the Musicians’ Pension Funds and per
forms for servicemen in Vietnam.

During a period of six months, Mr. Kay
had been home a total of only 16 days at
acattered intervals, Devoting himself un-
selfishly to humanity prevents him from
spending as much time as he'd like with
‘his daughter, Dena, a senior at Stanford
University.

Aas

Following Mr. Kaye's Itinerary with
UNICEF, he joined “Gadna,"" the Israel
National’ Youth Orehestra_and conducted
their group across Israel, Europe, Canada,
‘Mexico, and South Ame

In June he stopped entertaining in Las
Vegas and canceled another performance
at Chichester, England, the fighting
broke out in’ Israe} i on the
antipathy of the British press, he says, “It
was either diversion for the ladies of ‘Chi-
chester or entertaining the wounded Israeli
soldiers. Thad to make a decision; one has
to follow the dictates of his own conscience,
In time the whole thing will be forgotten.”

Ho hasn't worked professionally for more
than six months, but expects to go back to
films, as opposed to a weekly TV show.
Presently Mr. Kayo is acting in a picture
being made in France, "The Madwoman of
Chaillot," directed by'Bryan Forbes. Pro
duced by Warner Brothers-Seven Arts,
the film adaptation of Giraudoux's comic
fantasy also stars Katharine Hepburn, Yul
Brynner, and Charles Boyer,

Danny Kaye firmly states that he will
not consider entering the political field, but
is pleased his capablo contemporaries have
been victorious. Azied which comedian he
most admires, he says be has many favor-
lites and feelé that Red Skelton and Bob
Hope are masters of their art.

Because he thinks the world's hope for
future peaceful coexistence lies in working
‘with the younger generation, Br, Kaye con-

Commentary

Liability of consensus

The Italian elections have produced no
major upsets. In effect, they have con
firmed in office Premier Aldo Moro's coali-
tion government, based on an alliance of
the country’s two major right-of-center
and left-of-center democratic parties, But
‘what must not be overlooked is that the
elections have also pointed to a liability
ef consensus politics in parliamentary
democracies. In a word, the results tend
to confirm that the system in a parlia-
mentary democracy works better when
the electorate hns before it twa clear
alternatives, when the discontented have
an opportunity of casting their vote for
@ democratic party which stands some
likelihood of coming to power and thus
being able to do something to alleviate the
discontent.

Italy's coalition. government —still on
balance the best to run the country under
present circumstances — represents con
sensus politics. It brings together Italy's
biggest single party, the Christian Demo-
rats, and what had been the biggest non-
Communist alternative to the Christian
Democrats, the Socialists, Thus it robs the
electorate of a choice between the demo-
cratic Right and the democratic Left be-

¢ the one-time contestants have be-

In voting at the weekend, the Socialists
the ones who paid the biggest price
— in party terms — for being party to con-
sensus government. The votes that they

lost went mostly to the Communists, who
seem to have inherited some measure of
what the Socialists apparently surren-
dered by deciding to enter the govern-
ment with the Christian Democrats.
Ironically, the presence of the Commu-
nists as a valid party within a parli

mentary framework may have helped
spare Italy some of the more savage
wrenches which consensus polities — in
one form or another—have brought to
France and threaten West Germany with.

Interestingly in West Germany, the So-
cialists have of late joined in a coalition
fas minority member with the Christian
Democrats—the same pattern that has
persisted in Italy, Every sign indicates
that as a consequence the German Social-
ists, like the Italian Socialists, have lost
ground with the electorate,

In France, the setting is different, but
there is a parallel in general terms. Ten
years of Gaullism have been 10 years of
imposed consensus. There has not been
intelligent dialogue or meaningful politi-
cal interplay between the General and
the Left. The price is being paid this very
week,

‘None of this means that a particular
party ought to be more right-wing or
more left-wing. None of this is meant to
add to the respectability of Communists.
‘But what it does mean is that healthy con-
flict and healthy alternatives within a
democratic framework are needed to keep
democracy alive and well.

Containing the fire

‘Thus far major student uprisings have
shown an ability to attract great num-
bers for overt marches and seizures of
buildings, but the students have failed to
Rain a consensus in the political sense for
orderly negotiation with university or
government authorities,

In Paris, a meeting in the Théatre de
France of over two thousand students
showed them unable to agree on the issues
of their uprising, The New Left the stu-
dents were supposed to represent proved
to be a mixture of “Marxists,” “Maoists,”
“anarchists,” and "“situationists.” The lat-
ter, as defined by the New York Times,
“have no tdeology and weigh each pro-
posal as it arises,” and reflect the inco-
hesiveness of the protest elements.

‘The main splintering issue in Paris and
elsewhere is whether the students are
pressing for specific reform of their
campus or for widespread social reform.

This debate drove a third of the 70
members of the student negotiating body
at Columbia University to form their own
party. They hope to focus attention on

The purpose of problems |

President Johnson’ spoke wise words
when he warned that the curing of Amer-
ica’s ills depended upon the spirit in
which they are approached. Particularly
timely was his reminder that no prob-
lems are solved if men give way to “erip-
pling despair.”

It is important that a nation, like an
individual, bear in mind the fact that
problems arise for the specific purpose of
being solved. In short, such challenges,
however big or small, are an opportunity
for progress, if seen in this light.

This was never truer than of the United
States. Many of its problems (racial ten-
sion, rampant crime, pockets of poverty,
urban blight, ete.) “are major. But, as
President Johnson himself said, it is
utterly wrong to render a verdict “of
fatal sickness in our society.” These prob-
lems will, he so very rightly said, “be
solved by realism, by determination, by
commitment, by hope and by self-disci-
pline.”

One of the most instructive and
thought-provoking passages in the New

Columbia's renaissance, rather than get
drawn into protests with broader politi-
cal implications.

‘This restraining move of the moderates
is encouraging, though whether they can
dominate Columbia's student political
situation remains to be seen. New Left
elements in the past have been so intent
on fomenting crises that they have ne-
glected programmatic action. Reform, it
appears, must be left up to the very
administrations the young radicals are
protesting against.

No one argues reform is not needed.
‘Something is amiss at the Sorbonne when
“G00 archaeologists are trained while
there are jobs for only eight.

But now that the fires of change have
been lighted, surely the moderating ele-
ments must have firm support in their
attempts to contain their fire for the
illumination of their institution. And they
should not be confused with those who
would use their torches for anarchic con-
flagration, who must be met with wise
sternness.

‘Testament emphasizes that the chastening
effect of problems may be momentarily,
grievous but that the end result can and
should be a great step forward. This

ipplies as much to a people as to an indi-
vidual,

History is filled with examples of coun-
tries which had the courage and wisdom
to recognize that the time for a step for-
ward had come, listened to the guidings of
their highest’ concepts and became
stronger, happier and better as a result,
‘Who can really doubt that the United
States will not do the same thing
the problems which face it? 3

Problems and crises are not,.of t
selves, the major danger. The greatest
threat is the refusal to
wisely and calmly and to

meet it forcefully, In brief, of
any challenge is the mental atti n
toward it. If such trials are looked upon

as proofs of the profound fact that right
progress bas a more than human inspira-
tion, then it is impossible to give way to
discouragement or to consider such chal-
lenges beyond one’s power to meet.

Hanoi’s peace mood

Among the American negotiators at
Paris there is strong belief that North
‘Vietnam has a dual strategy: on the battle-
front, and in Washington,

One aim is to fracture the government
and the Army of South Vietnam, its co-
hesiveness, its fighting clan, Hence the
savage slashes at South Vietnamese cities
in the Tet offensive, and the latest heavy
attack on Saigon itself. Henee the rumors,
spread by the Viet Cong, that Washington
will “sell out” the Thieu government.

‘The other aim is to wear down the
American will-to-persevere, in this elec-
tion. year, by inflicting heavy casualties
on the American forces, thus appealing to
antiwar sentiment.

Hono} well uaderstands what impact a
disintegration of the Saigon government
would have on the Paris talks. It equally
understands that a wearing-thin of Amer-
fcan resolve could result in Washington
peace concessions otherwise unattainable,

Months ago, Henoi’s private pronounce-
ments were suggesting that 1968 was to
be the war's climactic year. That year now
fs nearly half over, and victory still eludes
the North,

Yet Hanoi’s rate of military replace-
ment is running very high, despite Amer-
fean bombing (which smashes an os
mated 20-25 percent of the supplies).
Hanoi’s war effort, reinforced by approxi-
mately a billion dollars’ worth of Soviet
materiel in the lest 12 months, has not
slackened off.

‘American negotiators, watching at Paris
for any telltale indicia of Hanoi's mood,
find little one way or the other, Hanoi
could be deciding now that the war was
going abysmally poorly, and could be pre-
paring for concessions that would permit
the development of an independent and
durable non-Communist regime in Saigon.
‘Or Hanoi could be determining to fight on,
to give not an appreciable inch, and to
utilize its reinforced Army in further at-
tempts to smash the Saigon government,
the South Vietnamese forces, and Amer
ica’s perseverence.

It is probably too early for Hanoi to
have come to final conclusions. The one
available fact, so far, is that Ho did agree
to peace talks, with some alacrity, when
he might well! have said “not interested”
as he did so often in the past.

‘As one who works with and trains Ameri

‘The American soldier in Vietnam, despite
his youth and the inexperience of his lead-

all he has been asked to do, and more. He
has served in a way which in any other

Collegiate computer

By John

Lisbon Falls, Maine

A gentleman was telling me the other day
about a college that puts its affairs into a
Computing machine which it rents from a
wholesale grocery’ company. All the bust-
ness affairs of the grocery chain are han:
dled by this machine, but even so its ca
pacity is not taxed. They keep wages, taxes,
inventories and all such, but there was
room over in a spare corner to feed in the
collegiate business, and they got a modest
fee for this service. Well, when the semes-
fer grades came out one atudent got sil
A's and four cases of black pepper.

This, at present, seems to be the total
situation with computing machines, and evir
dently we are doomed to a frustrating tu.
ture, coursing down a long road of mixed
up matters about which nobody can do
anything. At the slightest criticism, a com-
puter seems to draw in its head like a
turtle and sulk.

In connection with this same college, a
sheet of paper came out one day and said
the English department had no. funds for
mimeographing the final exams. Since funda
for mimeographing the final exams had been
allocated, and they hadn't been mimeo-
Braphed ‘yet, the professor in charge de-
murred soltly, as professors of English do,
bbut the bookkeeper showed him the sheet of
paper and it said there were no funds,

Since an English department without final
exams doesn’t ound just right some small
research went on, and after much mechani-
cal manipulation it was learned that the
English funds had inadvertently been ap-
plied to the department of biology, which
now had. twice as much money for the
mimeographing of final exams.

Lovers of the electronic process will be
glad to know that for eight years, now, the
English mimeographing has been paid for
by ‘biology. It was simpler to setup a
contra-account than {t was to begin again.

NOW! Through the Incredible Power of —

MENTAL PROJECTION

— You Can “PROJECT” Things Metaphysically Right into Being!

Dear Friend:

Here's news about a revolutionary and potentially earth-shaking PROJECTION
mechanism. It's based on a new metaphysical discovery, and is now available in
a startling book.

It's true. The famous "20th Century Philosopher," Anthony
Norvell, reveals one of the most astounding discoveries
ever made: how to use a powerful PROJECTION mechanism to

metaphysically transform your thoughts and desires into
reality.

Called "MENTAL PROJECTION" this mind mechanism can change your entire life
-- from the very first moment you turn it on -- money and power appear meta-

physically, as if out of nothing.

The famous Anthony Norvell explains the transmutation techniques you need
to work "MENTAL PROJECTION" -- and tells you with complete details:

* How to tune into the "Music of the Spheres" the wavelength over
which all “PROJECTIONY takes place.
* vow to "PROJECT" yourself into "The Land of Beginning Again" and
wipe out all your past mistakes and failure in a single blow, and
start over with a clean slate.

* How to "PROJECT" yourself through a mirror and come out with such dignity,
such regal power no one will dare defy you.

* How to write a sum of money on a slip of paper and "PROJECT" it into
becoming yours.

Now I will give you a clear, scientific demonstration of the natural laws
behind "MENTAL PROJECTION."

WHY YOU CAN TRANSMUTE THINGS INTO EXISTENCE:

For over 25 years Anthony Norvell searched the literature of all ages,


--- Page 11 ---
travelled to corn-:s of all parts of the ea -h. And throughout it all he looked for

just one thing -- the p-wer to turn thought into reality. Nowhere was the
answer to be had. But iinally he discovere. that with a certain technique he

could reverse important key laws of nature.

He discovered that he could make it just as easy to create matter, as it usually
is to destroy it. It's easy to start out with something -- say a $100 bill -- put
a match to it and end up with nothing. Now he found out, you can start out with
nothing, AND END UP WITH SOMETHING.

He could hardly contain his excitement. He tried it once.
It worked. He began telling others about it. It worked
for them. He called it "MENTAL PROJECTION" and tried it
on thousands of people no different from you.

USED PY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

Jane Addams was given 6 months to live because she was chronically wasting
away. But by giving away a certain part of herself, she was able to
"PROJECT" herself practically a whole new body. She lived to bury four

of her doctors.

xx A woman was 76. She never had a trade or profession but always longed
for one. She used The "Invisible Law of Mental Vibration" to "PROJECT"
herself a talent. She became a great painter and made $1 million before
she died at over 100.

xx A young man was caught ina fire. His legs were just about burned away.
Doctors feared he would die. He managed to pull through, but without
hope of walking again. Yet by contacting the "Cosmic Mind" he was able
to "PROJECT" himself a "new" set of legs. A few years later, in the world
famous Madison Square Garden, he ran the world's fastest indoor mile.

xx A man and his wife had little money. But they had their hearts set on
owning their own home. They used the technique of "Centro-Dynamics" to
"PROJECT" not just any old home, but their dream house. And they got
it for what little money they had. :

xx A certain group of people had no future before them. No money. No
contacts. No influence. Yet they wanted to be famous, They used "The
Magic Circle" technique to "PROJECT" a great talent into their lives.
Later, they all became famous movie stars. You'll recognize their names
immediately.

xx A man had no money all his younger life. His father died at a young age.
His mother scraped along by selling biscuits to men for lunch. Then he
used the Law of Capillary Action to "PROJECT" great wealth into his life.
Before he knew it the biscuit business just grew and grew. He became
a multi-millionaire.

Yes, "MENTAL PROJECTION" works, All you need do is use the specific
techniques, for the specific things you want.

IT WORKS LIKE THIS!

"MENTAL PROJECTION" works by enabling you to shape the "protoplasm" that fills

THE FABULOUS CAREER
OF ANTHONY NORVELL

For twenty-five years, a bronze plaque on the doors of New
York’s world-famous Carnegie Hall has commemorated the
teachings of Anthony Norvell, one of the great minds of
our time.

Over the years, tens of thousands have come to absorb his
deep and profound wisdom —a_ complete and practical
system of self-mastery and spiritual power that com! ines the
Science of the West with the Mystic Knowledge of the East.

Norvell’s deep thirst for spiritual fulfillment has taken
him on travels to the most remote corners of the earth, He
spent many years in India, where he studied with a noted
guru (Holy Master). In North India, he later met a Tibetan
monk from the Great Monastery at Lhasa, who revealed cen-
turies-old secrets to him — the most sacred mysteries of the
Orient, revealed in this book.

you end up with something -- exactly what you want.

For example, you'll see how to use the following techniques to "PROJECT" meta-
physically what you want: ;

1. How to "PROJECT" a much longer life for yourself -- 100 and over is not
impossible -- by increasing your own personal charge of "magnetism."

2. How to "PROJECT" firmer lips, cheeks, smoother skin and a younger look, in
general, through the technique "magnetic tensing."

3. How to "PROJECT" contact with the "Higher Mind" and get explicit advice on any
problem having to do with family, neighbors, friends or bosses.
