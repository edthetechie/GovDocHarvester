SAC (44-new) DATE: 6/5/68

Supv. ANDREW M. SMITH

UNSUB.; SHOOTING OF
SENATOR ROBERT KENNEDY
CR

At 9:00 a.m., 6/5/68, Supervisor CHUCK HARDING,
Atlanta Office, telephonically advised he had just received
a call from the Bureau instructing the Atlanta Office to
call 12 other field offices immediately and furnish the
following Bureau instructions:

All field offices are to remain alert to receive
any information concerning any possible racial violence or
demonstrations resulting from the shooting of Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY. If any information is received in this regard, the
Bureau is to be advised immediately by teletype. The Bureau
does not desire to be advised of the administrative handling
of these instructions, such as the fact that all sources
have been alerted, and the like, but only is interested in
receiving positive information of any racial violance or
demonstrations.

On instruction of Supervisor HARDING, Supervisor
JOE CONNORS in the Mobile Office was advised at approximately
9:30 a.m. of the above information.

SA MARVIN EUBANKS has been instructed to alert all
of his sources and also have SA C. B. STANBERRY, who was not
immediately available, to alert his sources and informants.
SA EUBANKS is now in the process of alerting all Resident
Agents to alert their sources and furnish any information
immediately concerning any possible violence.

In the same matter, it is noted that at approxi-
mately 8:15 a.m., Chief JAMIE MOORE of the Birmingham PD

ically advised as follows:
telephon y Yo ~SPP2 ~f

He has learned from Officer MARCUS JONES, who had
obtained information from his sources, that the "Poor
Peoples' March," which was camped near Mt. Zion Church at
Bessemer, had on the morning of 6/5/68 hitched up their

mules, apparently earlier than usual, as if they were leaving
their camping place. However, apparently when they heard of
the KENNEDY shooting, they engaged in a discussion concerning
this and the people involved in the march then returned to
their camping place, apparently cancelling, at least for the
time being, their plans for immediate departure.

Chief MOORE advised he had not learned of any plans
for any demonstrations or violence as a result of the Senator
KENNEDY shooting, but said that if he did learn of any violence,
he would inform the Birmingham Office. He requested that if
we receive any such information that we inform him of it.

SA LARRY GETTINGS was advised immediately of Chief
MOORE 's call and he said he was then in the process of
attempting to contact Officer MARCUS JONES, concerning the
"Poor Peoples' March." SA GETTINGS has been requested to
alert his sources to furnish information of any violence or
demonstrations.

FD-350 (Rev. 7-16-63)

“We're not going to accept vio-
lence as a way of life in America,”
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy told cam-
paign crowds in California last week.

On Tuesday, moments after he
claimed victory in ‘that ptimary,
violence struck him down. ,

The Birmingham News believes

crisis not entirely isolated to the mur-
ders and attempted murder of public
figures.

What is happening does violence
not just to individuals but to Amer-
ican’s political processes. What is
threaiened is the murder of the
American dream.

“This nation prides itself, rightly, in
its nearly two centuries-long record
of peaceful transition of government
through free elections. Events of re-
cent months—of recent years—cast
a deepening shadow over that record.
Jt js no ilonger _inconceivable—

though still by no means probable— |

that conditions could arise which
would make the holding of a presi-
dential election and the transfer of
power to a new administration on
schedule questionable.

It seems to The News that certain
things are absolutely vital at this

nation united:

The President of the United States
must, must, stand before the nation
and tell its people directly, forcefully,
that their country now must insist on
responsible citizenship. He made a
start in the right direction in his tele-
vised address to the nation last night.
But what is needed is much more than
the appointment of another commis-
sion, however valuable the work of
its distinguished members might be.

Too long have’ the President and
other national leaders permitted the

United States- government to be
bullied by an irresponsible few. Too

against gross violations of good sense
if not of 1. Ware

Every citizen in this country, in
public office or private life, who can

(exert any influence in behalf of a

ee a

that this nation faces grave crisis, a.

moment if America is to survive as a-

long have they hesitated to speak out:

e

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

‘—— The Time Is Now —\

—N\

restoration of reason has an obliga-
tion to his country to do so.

The nation must insist’ on this.

.Of course there is dissent; of —
course there are differences of opin- -
jon, There always have been and .
there always will be. But one of our °

strengths always has been our po-
litical system’s ability to record these

differences and to adjust to them. « -
There is machinery for change in’

America; machinery for peaceful, or-
derly redress of grievances.

What some people have fostered is
not orderly change but the destruc-

tion of the very mechanism, our po- —

litical system, which can effect it.

America must pledge itself to deal :

honestly with the needs of its citi-

zens. It also must ask that all citizens -

have faith that the pledge will be
honored; that they cease provocative

conduct and join in a common rededi- .

cation to preservation ‘of the consti-
tutional foundations of that faith.

It has been cited so frequently that
it is by now a Cliche, U. S. Supreme

Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ -

observation that the right of free

speech does not carry with it the’ -
right to shout “Fire!” in a crowded ~

ee

theater.

Too many people have gone much -
too far in their attacks on America, :
however real their grievances. Too. ©
many people have remained silent :
rather than risk, in the emotional |

climate which has been generated,
being misinterpreted.

It is not' out ‘of lack of sympathy
for those who need assistance or out ©
of lack of commitment to providing —
it that responsible Jeaders now -
should speak up. It is out of first and °

overriding concern for preserving
this nation.

Those truly concerned about Amer- .

ica, truly. devoted to this nation, will
have no difficulty noting the inflam-
mability of the situation and acting
to damp rather than fan it,

! Those who do the opposite ne no 9 long-
er can be treated as if they have no
responsibility for their actions and
their utterances,

The Kennedy Shooting

Ls >
/, terms of the personal tragedy to

the Kennedy family, the shooting of
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy is simply in-
credible:

The deaths of a son and a daughter
in plane crashes were accidents,
which could happen to anybody, the
severe injury of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy also resulted: from a plane
crash, an accident.

But the murder of President John

. F. Kennedy and the attempted slay-
ing of the senator were no accidents,
These crimes were committed by.

in the cheers raised at the news of
the death of President Kennedy and
in the question raised by those who
seek to justify the slaying of Dr.
King and the shooting of Scnator
Kennedy: “Well, they asked for it,
didn't “they?” ..
Society must rid itself of this ~

plague; and society can only accom-
plish this through its leaders, who-

‘ever they may be.

They must be Jeaders to whom jus-
tice is a sacred obligation and en-
forcement of the Jaw a first duty, sub--

men with deluded minds—either“ject to no exceptions.

poisoned by the most evil bigotry or
bereft of all powers of reason.

Murder generated in passion or in
criminal greed (as in robbery) is
no less tragic but is susceptible to
some semblance of explanation. As-
sassination for the sake of assassina-
tion is beyond the limits of human
reasoning. Yet it seems to gee with
trend which has infested our so-
ciefy—tHe wild and unrestrained no-
tion that violence is justified by its
objectives, that government can be
stampeded by marches and extrava-
gant villification of public officials,
that in the end any end can be
achieved simply by maligning or
eliminating others.

It is a state of affairs which could
trigger in an already diseased brain
(and obviously has) the idea that if
you do not like a policy, trample it

(as in some of our universities) and

if you do not like a man, slander and
berate him—or. shoot him!

This mood of malice has been un-
duly tolerated, indeed often encour-
aged (knowingly or otherwise) by
some of our more avid politicians—
by their over-heightened statements,
by their appeals to emotion rather
than judgment, by the abuse they
have dealt those who differed with
them.

It has been said before by some
(after the Kennedy assassination and,
after the Martin Luther King assas-
sination) that our society is “sick.”
Now it is being said again.

Many have seen a manifestation of

Whe si Sickness in our own’ community

No a

If any good can come from so
despicable a crime as the attempt on
Senator Kennedy’s life, it can only ~
be that the senseless misfortune in-
flicted upon him will provoke gov-
ernment (and the country as a whole)

“into restoring civilized processes and

erasing so-called “civil disobedience”
in all its vagaries.

The first evidence of this type @ of
reaction already has occurred in the
House of Representatives, where a
vote on the Senate-passed anti-crime -
bill suddenly has been scheduled to-
day—one of the many steps which
have been called for during these
many months and years of rising
crime. Gun control is a top provision
of this bill.

Meanwhile, every decent American,
as a member of the overwhelming
majority, will prayerfully wish for
the prompt recovery of Senator Ken-

nedy to full health and faculty. And,

will sincerely commiserate with the*
family which has suffered so much, -
tragedy.

- The effect of the shooting on the
election is highly problematical and
at this moment far beside the point.

The only issue now was aptly cap-
suled by Governor Hughes of New
Jersey when he said:

“We'd better wake up and take
the guns away from the lunatics be-
fore they shoot all of us.”

if the bullet is to replace the bal-
Jot in American politics, if violence is
to replace rhetoric and persuasion,
then our way of life is lost. And w/

pray God, simply cannot happen.
