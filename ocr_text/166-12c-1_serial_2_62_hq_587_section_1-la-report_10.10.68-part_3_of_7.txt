her that the man with the gun was reaching over someone to
point the gun, but she does not recall anyone in front of the
man. She noted only that he was a small dark-~complected man
with dark hair. She did not notice him enough to be able to
positively identify or recognize him again.

At about this time she was knocked down by the rush
of the crowd and could not get up. She was afraid of getting
erushed or shot and crawled back down the corridor or room to
@ partition leading into another adjoining room. While crawling
into the room she recalled crawling past a man who was on her
right and was lying on the floor very still. She thought he
was dead and noted that he was covered with blood.

She finally sat down next to a Mr. GOLDSTEIN who had
also been shot in the hip. She was sitting there when Mrs.
ETHEL KENNEDY came into the room and spole to .GOLDSTEIN.

Miss SCHULTE advised that she could not identify the
person she saw with the gun and who probably was the person who
shot Mr. KENNEDY. She stated that there was so much noise and
excitement that she never did really focus on the individual with
her eyes. She did not see Mr. .KENNEDY get hit, at least she did
not know that he had been hit as she was knocked down or fell
down soon after she heard the first shots.

She was later joined in the room, where she had taken
refuge by DICK FRICK who was not previously with her in the
hallway when Mr. KENNEDY was shot.

She concluded by stating that she could furnish no
further information regarding the shooting of Mr. KENNEDY.

NANCY WALLACE (iirs. JOHN WALLACE nee Webber), 10
Behr Avenue, San Francisco, telephone 564-8883, furnished
the following information:

WALLACE is presently an employee of the Fireman's
Fund American Insurance Companies, 3333 California Street,
San Francisco, and is a student in the Computer Programming
Section. :

On the day of the State of California primary
elections, June 4, 1968, a group of about 25 students,
including WALLACE, from the University of California at
Santa Barbara, California, had a suite on the third floor of
the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. This
suite was registered in the name of ROGER ARBUCKLE. The
students arrived at their suite in the Ambassador Hotel about -
10:00 p.m., and for over an hour watched the results of the
primary elections as they were being broadcast on television.

About 11:30 p.m. some of the students decided to
leave the suite to see whet was going on in the hotel. VALERIE
SCHULTE, who was handicapped with a cast due to a broken leg,
and WALLACE ended up at the Embassy Room on the second floor
of the hotel shortly after they left their suite. They tried
to gain entrance to the Embassy Room in order to join the
victory celebration for Senator ROBERT KENNEDY, but were
informed that they could not enter the room without a press
pass. They then decided to try to get into the Embassy Room
by going through another room and through the kitchen into
the anteroom and then into the Embassy Room. They were
successful in this endeavor, and arrived in the Embassy Room
as Senator KENNEDY was speaking to the gathering. The room was
very crowded, and SCHULTE found it difficult to maneuver with
her leg in a cast so she withdrew and went back to the kitchen
area.

WALLACE stayed in the Embassy Room until after
Senator KENNEDY finished speaking and was standing near a
doorway leading from the Embassy Room into the anteroom.

She did not see Senator KENNEDY leave the Embassy Room;
however, shortly after he finished speaking, she heard some
noiges, to which she did not pay any attention, but which she
now thinks could have been shots. Right after she heard these
noises, a commotion started in the room and people were saying
someone had been shot. She worked her way out of the Embassy
Room, and returned to the suite occupied by the students. It
was there that she learned that Senator.KENNEDY had been shot.

To the best of her recollection, WALLACE feels that
she did not see anything connected with the actual shooting
of Senator KENNEDY, and has no recollection of observing anyone
answering the description of SIRHAN SIKHAN. She does recall
that VALERIE SCHULTE later told her that she had been very
close to Senator KENNEDY in the kitchen when he was shot.

MARY SIRHAN, 696 East Howard Street, advised that
her son, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, had a savings account at the
Lake Washington Office of the United States National Bank
of San Diego, 1255 North Lake Street, Pasadena, California.
She exhibited the passbook for this account, and a i

LOWELL J, BEAN, Assistant Professor of Anthropology
at California State College, Hayward, California, was interviewed
at his residence, 2040 O'Farrell, Apartment 308, San Francisco.
BEAN received his BA and Master of Arts Degrees from the Univer-
sity of California, at Los Angeles, California, and is presently
writing his dissertation for his Doctorate of Philosophy Degree,
also from the University of California, at Los Angeles, California.
BEAN furnished the following information on SIRHAN B. STRHAN,
with whom he is acquainted as SIRHAN was formerly a student in a
Cultural Anthropology class which he taugnt at Pasadena City
College, Pasadena, California, approximately Spring 1964.
This was a two hour class that met on Tuesday and Thursday,
consisting of approximately 4O students, many of whom were
foreign students. At that time, BEAN was teaching three diff-
erent anthropology subjects and introductory sociology, and
believes that SIRHAN may have been a student in his sociology
class, but is not sure of this.

He recalls SIRHAN as a pleasant, polite, reliable,
good student, who dressed neatly and who got along with other
students except on two occasions when he exhibited emotional
outbursts during discussions with other students on the Israeli-
Arab cOnflict.

It was his policy in teaching the Cultural Anthropology
class to call on various students to prepare and give oral
reports in class on the culture of their nationality. At his
request, SIRHAN gave an informal report to the class on Arabic
culture. SIRHAN discussed Pan-Arabianism, which he described
as a joining together of all Arabic nations into a dominant
cultural and political block which will become a major political
power in the Near East. He described this cultural and political
block of nations as overriding all their political boundaries
into one inte ‘gral unity. BAN had never looked at the Arabic
culture previously as a political force, and to him it was some-
what frightening to see the potential intense drive of this
political fantastic force as related by SIRHAN. All of SIRHAN's
thinking in his report wae in the terms of Pan-Arabianism, Pan

meaning "all" the Arabic nations including Northern Africa,
egypt, Turkey, and others joining together into one great force.
SIRHAN became very emotional during his report, and when an
American-Jewish student in class either asked SIRHAN a con~
troversial question or made a negative remark about the Arabs!
involvement in the current conflict with Israel, SIRHAN became
emotional, almost to the point of violence. The emotional
eruption between SIRHAN and this student almost developed into
a fist fight which argument was stopped by BEAN.

uither after this incident.or on another occasion
a short time later, SIRHAN again became involved in a very
heated discussion in the hall at school with a student on
the Arab-Moslem-Israeli conflict. SIRHAN exhibited an almost
uncontrollable temper in defense of Arab national unity.

SIRHAN did not associate with other students, from
the Near Fast, most of whom were from Iran. These students were
“yarty boys" and not good students. SIRHAN was a good student
and did his assignments well, but probably would not be classified
as an "A" student. The other Near Fast students tried to connive
their Professors into getting good grades and always had excuses
for failing to do their class work.

There was an active New Left group at Pasadena City
College, Pasadena, California, including a W. &. B. DuBois Club
and Students For a Democratic Society. To his knowledge,
SIRHAN had nothing to do with either of these groups, and
was never active in their rallies or demonstrations.

On two occasions in 1965, after SIRHAN had left
Pasadena City College, he stopped in to see BEAN at school.
On one occasion, he had lunch with him and on another occasion,
had dinner with him. BAN at the time was teaching night school
and believeg on both occasions, SIRHAN stopped in to see him
without previously calling him, and they were impromptu visits.
He can not recall any of their conversations during the two
visits. It was his practice, however, to frequently have lunch
with his students and also have dinner with them when he was
teaching night school.

BEAN was on the Board of Trustees of the Malki Indian _
Museum, located on Morongo Indian Reservation near Palm Springs,
California. Students paying $.50 could become members of the
museum and this money was used for the operation of the museum.
SIRHAN became a member and BEAN was surprised to see this because
actually, foreign students do not join the museum as they were
not interested in this project. Many of the students who become
members visit the museum;and work with the Indians, however, he
can not ever recall that SIRHAN visited the museum. The last

vane he had any contact with SIRHAN was when they had dinner in
1965.

The night former Senator ROBURT F. Ki:NNEDY was shot
in Los Angeles, California, BEAN was watching television and
recognized SIRHAN as the accused assassin. When he saw that
SIRHAN was involved, his mind immediately reflected upon what
had occurred in his classroom when SIRHAN was giving a report
and he became very emotional in his thinking on Arab unity.
When SIRHAN was not emotionally disturbed, he had a very
pleasant personality and 'got along nicely with other students.

APPENDIX
STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it
is known today, came into being at a founding convention held
at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. The SDS is an association
of young people on the left and has a current program of pro-
testing the draft, promoting a campaign for youth to develop
a conscientious objector status, denouncing United States
intervention in the war'in Vietnam and to "radically transform"
the university community, and provide for its complete control
by students. Gus. Hall, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,
when interviewed by a representative of United Press International
in San Francisco, Galifornia, on May 14, 1965, described the
SDS as a part of the “responsible left" which the Party has
"going for us". At the June, 1965, SDS National Convention,
an anticommunist proviso was removed from the SDS constitution.
In the October 7, 1966, issue of "New Left Notes", the official
publication of SDS, an SDS spokesman stated that there are some
‘communists in SDS and they are welcome. The national head-
quarters of this organization as of April 18, 1967, was located
in Room 206, 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young. socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP
itself. .

A second source has advised that the founding con- -
vention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21,
1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at
which time the name W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America (DCA) was
adopted. Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United
States attended this convention.

-. The second source advised in September, 1966, that
Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro
communities the Party still supported the plan to build "left"
socialist centers and to solidify the Party base through the
DCA, This source also advised in September, 1966, that Daniel
Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party
believes the DGA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass
organization favorable to socialism, socialist countries and
Marxism, and in April, 1967, advised that Gus Hall, CPUSA General
Secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on
developing mass resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1967, that Jarvis
Tyner was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at the
Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New York,
from September 8-10, 1967.

A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that Jarvis

He has been residing in California since May 19,
1961, when he entered this country on a student visa to
study at Pasadena City College (PCC). It was at PCC sometime
during 1963 that he first met SIRHAN SIRHAN, who was a fellow
student. From their first meeting in 1963 until 1966 when
LECLAIR finished at PCC, LECLAIR would often meet and talk
with SIRHAN SIRHAN at the PCC cafeteria or occasionally at
a coffee shop or restaurant neighboring the PCC campus. LECLATR
never visited STRHAN's home, however, and their activities
together were limited to the PCC campus.

LECLAIR described SIRHAN SIRHAN as a quiet person
who displayed extremely good manners and who dressed very
nicely. According to LECLAIR, SIRHAN SIRHAN was popular with
other students of both sexes and LECLAIR believes SIRHAN
dated frequently although he could not recall the names of
any girls SIRHAN might have dated. LECLAIR could not recall
the name of an oriental student at PCC who appeared,to LECLAIR,
to be a close friend of SIRHAN. However, LECLAITR believes this
oriental is related to the owner of Jung's Inn, a restaurant
on Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena. The only other possible
friend of SIRHAN SIRHAN that LECLATR could recall is a TIM
MC INTIRE of Pasadena. MC INTIRE, LECLAIR believes, is a
friend of the SIRHAN family and might have been in some way
connected with the sponsorship of the SIRHAN family when they
entered the United States. LECLAIR could not provide any other
information regarding MC INTIRE.

The conversations between LECLAIR and SIRHAN SIRHAN
were mainly concerned with school and girls, but from time to
time they would discuss politics. During these political
conversations, SIRHAN never exhibited anything but a reserved
reasonable demeanor and LECLAIR could not recall SIRHAN ever
losing his temper.

teaching 10th Grade English and Social Studies to SIRHAN SIRHAN
in 1960 or 1961. MC KAY recalled SIRHAN as being"different"

a good command of the English language for the short time
he had been in the United States. He recalled SIRHAN appeared
to like to wear his uniform of the California Cadet Corps,
when some students refused to wear it if possible. He said
while SIRHAN was polite, he was not reticent, and was willing
to recite and discuss issues in class. Mr. MC KAY said they
discussed world affairs at some length because it was a Social
Studies class, and SIRHAN was interested, He saw no particular
leaning on the part of SIRHAN against Israel at that time,
although SIRHAN had a nationalistic interest in the fact that he
was of Arabic background, He said the Suez crisis was recent
enough that it was discussed in class, and the discussion as he
recalled it was about evenly divided for and against Israel.
Mr. MC KAY could recall no apparent anti-American feelings on
the part of SIRHAN, although SIRHAN expressed a scholarly
disapproval of United States policy in supporting Israel more
than the Arab cause. This disapproval did not appear to be
violent or to make SIRHAN too unhappy. Mr. MC KAY could recall

None of the incidents resulted in any violence or anything
other than strong words.
