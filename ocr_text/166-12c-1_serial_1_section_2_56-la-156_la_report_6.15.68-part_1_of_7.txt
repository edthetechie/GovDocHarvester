Mrs. MARGUERITE DAUGHERTY, 709 East Howard Street,
telephone number SY 7-4664, furnished the following
information:

She moved to this address in December 1962. She
recalls that approximately one year after moving into this
home, she observed an individual painting the house across
the street at 696 East Howard. As she needed some painting
work done on her house, she approached this individual to
inquire as to whether he could do some painting work for
her. She subsequently learned that this individual was the
son of the woman who, a short time later, moved into the
house at 696 East Howard. The woman who occupied this house
was a Mrs. MARY SIRHAN. She lived there with three of her
sons and a daughter. She learned that the man whom she had
talked to about painting her house was the eldest son of
MARY SIRHAN. She recalls having met each of Mrs. SIRHAN's
five sons and her daughter at one time or another but she
cannot recall the names of these children because they are
foreign names. Mrs. SIRHAN's daughter passed away approxi-
mately one year ago of leukemia.

Mrs. DAUGHERTY viewed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Number BK 495139,
and stated that she recognizes this photograph as being the
second youngest son of Mrs. MARY SIRHAN. She stated that
this son lived with his mother at 696 East Howard but that
she recalled for a lohg period of time prior to’ the death
of his sister, he was not seen around the house. She
commented to Mrs, SIRHAN concerning this and Mrs. SIRHAN
merely said that this boy had "acquired the ways of American
boys" without elaborating further. She did not say whether
this boy had actually moved out of the house.

Mrs. DAUGHERTY continued that she is quite certain
that SIRHAN SIRHAN has been living at home in recent months.
He has an old pink DeSoto automobile which for many months
was inoperative. However, about one month ago, SIRHAN got

it working again. As best as she can recall, she last saw
SIRHAN approximately one week prior to June i, 1968,

Mrs. DAUGHERTY stated that SIRHAN SIRHAN was the
only member of the family who did do any work in the yard.
He used to mow the lawn and helped his mother in various
other ways. Occasionally, she would see him going or coming
from the house or doing yard work and would wave to him;
however, she never had any personal contact with SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN. She knows of no friends of SIRHAN SIRHAN
and added that she does not recall ever seeing any young
people visit the home, although occasionally, she did see
older persons visiting at the home. She never saw SIRHAN
SIRHAN in the company of any persons his own age, male or
female.

Mrs. DAUGHERTY stated that she did not know
where SIRHAN SIRHAN worked and frequently used to wonder
whether he had a job because she saw him so much during
the daytime. On several occasions in the not too distant
past, she recalled seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN running up the
street as if he were late for work. She heard recently
that he worked for a health food store on Lake Street in
Pasadena.

Prior to the assassination of Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY, she never heard the neighbors discuss SIRHAN SIRHAN
or any other member of the SIRHAN family. All of the neighbors
considered the SIRHAN family to be normal people who never
did “anything out of the way". However, since the assassination,
Mrs. NANCY (PETER) JOYCE, who used to live in the house next
door to her but who now lives on North Chester Street, told
her that all of the children in the neighborhood were afraid
of SIRHAN SIRHAN. She stated that she does not know why
Mrs, JOYCE would say this and, as far as she was concerned,
it is not true as children frequently played outside when
SIRHAN SIRHAN was working in his yard. She stated that she
takes care of her granddaughter five days a week and that
her granddaughter has not complained or even mentioned
SIRHAN SIRHAN,

Mrs. DAUGHERTY stated that she recalls that on
several occasions, SIRHAN SIRHAN had discussions at length
with a Negro male, who had a beard and who was the regular
trash collector on East Howard Street. She last saw SIRHAN
SIRHAN talking with this Negro approxinately three weeks
ago. She stated that the trash is pick sed up on Wednesdays
between 10:00 and 11:30 AM,

Mrs. DAUGHERTY stated that this morning, she
received a telephone call from a Mrs. E,. K. ALLEN, 230
Cordova Street, telephone number 512-1059, who advised
that she was a close personal friend of the SIRHAN family.
Mrs, ALLEN desired Mrs, DAUGHERTY to deliver a message to
Mrs, SIRHAN to the effect that she (ALLEN) was a member of
the American Arab Club and also that America was to blame
for Senator KENNEDY's death rather than SIRHAN SIRHAN,
Mrs. DAUGHERTY stated that she has not as yet delivered
this message to Mrs. SIRHAN.

Mrs. DAUGHERTY concluded that as she has never
had any discussions whatsoever with SIRHAN SIRHAN, she
knows nothing of his personal or political interests. She
added that she has never heard anyone else comment concerning
SIRHAN SIRHAN, except as noted above.

Mrs. NANCY JOYCE, 1450 North Chester Street, advised
that she has only lived at her present residence for approxi-
mately one month and formerly resided at 717 East Howard Street
for approximately two years.

JOYCE stated that during this period of time, she
has known of the SIRHAN family who resided almost directly
across the street from her residence but that she never
associated with the SIRHAN family. She stated that on numerous
occasions, she saw the mother and brother of SIRHAN SIRHAN
and merely acknowledged a cordial hello. She stated that
she also saw SIRHAN SIRHAN on several occasions walking on
Howard Street all hours of the day and night. She stated
that because of this factor, she did not think that SIRHAN
had any type of employment. JOYCE advised that she never
entered into any conversation with SIRHAN SIRHAN because he
appeared to her as being a "creep". She stated that just
looking at SIRHAN SIRHAN made her very uncomfortable.

JOYCE stated that on one occasion approximately one
month ago, she was shopping at a local grocery store and had
observed SIRHAN at the same store. She stated that while
walking home, SIRHAN seemed to be following her. She added
that after she reached her residence and went into the house,
SIRHAN just stood out in front of her house until her husband
went outside and then SIRHAN ran to his house.

JOYCE stated that she does not recall seeing any
strange visitors visiting the SIRHAN house or in fact seeing
any strange cars parked at the SIRHAN residence.

JOYCE advised that she thought at various times
that she had heard what sounded like gunshots in the neighbor-
hood but never could be certain of this. She stated that
she first heard what she thought to be gunshots sometime
around December of 1967 and the last time sometime either in
February or March of 1$68. She stated that the shots appeared
to be coming from an area in the vicinity of SIRHAN's residence

in the area. She stated that she did not give it much though:
because not too long ago several young children in the area

stated that the trash is always pickec up on Wednesday and
described the individual talking with SIRHAN as a Negro male,
approximately 5'10° and approximately 30 vears old.

Mrs. EDNA FREUH, 717 East Howard, furnished the
following information:

She has resided at this address since August 1967.
She knows that a family by the name of SIRHAN lives at
696 East Howard, across the street from hey and that in this
house reside Mrs. MARY SIRHAN and three of her sons, ADEL,
MUNIR, who is also called "Joe", and SIRHAN.

Mrs, FRUEH viewed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Department Number BK 495139,
and stated that she recognized this photograph as being that
of SIRHAN SIRHAN, the son of Mrs. MARY SIRHAN. She stated
that approximately two weeks ago, the next door neighbor
to the SIRHANS, BRANDON LAMONT (phonetic), who lives at
708 East Howard, was involved in some sort of incident with
one of the SIRHAN boys. She was not certain which of the
boys this was, however, he was driving a 1955 pink and white
DeSoto which is frequently parked in the SIRHANs! driveway.
While nothing of a serious nature occurred, there apparently
were some harsh words between the SIRHAN boy and BRANDON
LAMONT. Mrs. FREUH stated that there are six men living
with BRANDON LAMONT as well as a couple of women with four
minor children. The neighbors are up in arms about these
people because of the activities that are taking place at
that house. The children in this house are apparently not
very well cared for. JANE LAMONT, who is the wife of BRANDON
LAMONT, apparently is a member of the Peace and Freedom
Movement. Mrs. FREUH thought that perhaps this was why
the SIRHAN boy would have had "words" with LAMONT,

Mrs. FREUH stated that she has never seen any
visitors at the SIRHAN house. She has seen SIRHAN SIRHAN
mow the lawn on occasions and commented how nice he kept
the yard. Prior to the assassination of Senator ROBERT F,.
KENNEDY, she never heard any of the neighbors make any
comments concerning SIRHAN SIRHAN. The only comments she

Mrs. SIRHAN was extremely gentle with the children and

was recommended as a babysitter. However, since the
assassination of Senator KENNEDY, she has heard that children
in the neighborhood were afraid of SIRHAN SIRHAN, Mrs. FREUH
attributed this statement to Mrs, JOYCE, who formerly lived
in this neighborhood in 1967. She added that she has two
children and that neither of these children have said that
they are afraid of SIRHAN SIRHAN. Mrs. JOYCE had commented
that SIRHAN SIRHAN had "looked her over" and felt that
SIRHAN could attack her. The only comments the other
neighbors have made concerning SIRHAN SIRHAN since the
assassination of Senator KENNEDY was that he was "quiet"

and "helpful".

Mrs. FREUH stated that she has not seen SIRHAN
SIRHAN around the house during the past two weeks, She
continued that she has never had any conversations with him
and has no idea as to who his friends are, where he works
or anything concerning his personal habits or activities.
She could furnish no other information.

Mr, STEPHEN FREUH, 717 East Howard, furnished the
following information:

He has lived at this address since August 1967.
He works full-time and attends school at night and, because
of this, spends very little time in the neighborhood. He
stated that he is only vaguely acquainted with the members
of the SIRHAN family who reside at 696 East Howard. However,
approximately two weeks ago, one of the SIRHAN boys was
driving a pink and white DeSoto automobile slowly down the
street. This was approximately 10:00 PM. He recalled that
BRANDON LAMONT (phonetic), who resides at 708 East Howard
and who is about 20 to 21 years old, called to the driver
of this pink and white car, "Are you looking for someone?
Can I help you?" The driver of the car responded in a very
hostile way, "You don't belong in this neighborhood. Why
don't you get out of here?" LAMONT then went into the house,
The person driving the car went into the SITRHAN house and,
during the next two or three hours, he was seen walking
around the LAMONT home smoking a cigarette and getting in
and out of the 1956 DeSoto. However, nothing more of consequence
happened concerning this incident.

Mr. FREUH viewed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Department Number BK 495139, and
stated that he recognized this photograph as being one of
the SIRHAN boys but that he did not know whether this was
the individual who was involved in the above described
incident.

Mr. FREUH stated that he has recollection of two
1955 DeSotos being parked at the SIRHAN house, one of which
is pink and white, as described above, and the other is
blue with primer spots. He stated that he does not recall
seeing the pink and white DeSoto in the last few days.
However, he has seen a beige Volkswagen parked in the driveway
of the SIRHAN home.

Mrs. MARION WALDO, 670 East Howard ftreet, Pasedena,
California, advised that she has resided at this address for
approximately the past 20 years. She noted thac possibly six
years ago SIRHAN SIRHAN, his mother MARY and several brothers
and a sister moved in at 696 East Howard Street, two doors
down the street.

She advised that they were a very quiet reserved
family, who kept to themselves and did not socialize with their
neighbors. She advised that they were extremely quiet about
their own family affairs almost to the extent she felt they
were ashamed of something. She stated she only knew SIRHAN
SIRHAN to say hello to and he impressed her as a quiet polite
person. She stated that about tno years ago SIRHAN's brother
SHARIF had given some expensive gifts to his girl friend but
she continued to date other fellows. Apparently this upset
SHARIF quite a bit because she learned reading a newspaper
account of how he placed a bomb in this girl friend's car.

As she recalled it, SHARIF was caught while he was doing this
and the girl was not injured. However, she stated that several
times after this incident she saw him back on the street and

she did not know how this incident came out. She further stated
that this family was so quiet that when SIRHAN's sister died
about one year ago they did not even know she was married until
they read it in the newspaper. She stated they impressed her

as being mysterious people.

She further stated that possibly one or two years ago
Miss ANN SYLVAN and Mrs. OLIVE BLAKESLEE, next door neighbors
to SIRHAN SIRHAN, had told her that MARY SIRHAN had informed
them (SYLVAN and BLAKESLEE) that she was worried about her
son, SIRHAN, because he was becoming too communistic. She could
not recall any further details concerning this statement.
However, she stated yesterday she talked to both Miss SYLVAN
and Mrs. BLAKESLEE about this conversation and they both stated
they could not recall SIRHAN's mother making the statement.

She advised she could furnish no further pertinent
information concerning SIRHAN SIRHAN.

him to be "kind and gentle" and recalls that on the few
occasions on which she has had any contact with SIRHAN
STRHAN, they discussed gardening work. She stated that
SIRHAN SIRHAN has always been helpful around the house and
that he frequently worked in the yard. She last saw SIRHAN
SIRHAN approximately two weeks ago when she stopped by the
SIRHANs home to say "hello" to Mrs. SIRHAN. At that time,
the family was watching television in the living room.

Mrs. PULITO stated that she has never heard anyone

Mrs. SIRHAN was advised of her rights, which she
orally waived after discussions with her sons SHARIF BISHARA

write it, and she signs it.

Mrs. SIRHAN and her son, SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN,
discussed their knowledge of the assassination of King
ABDULLAH of Jordan, the grandfather.of King HUSSEIN.

This occurred in probably the early 1950's. Their knowledge
of the incident is based entirely on their recollection

of news accounts of the incident at the time. It is their
recollection that a man named MUSTAFA ESHOO (phonetic) shot
the king as he knelt in prayer. They recall that probably
the killer then turned the gun on himself and killed
himself, The killer was in no way related to, connected

Mrs, SITRHAN added that she heard a news story
today alleging that a brother of her son SIRHAN SIRHAN had
been arrested as an Israeli spy. She noted this was absurd
in that she has only five sons, SIRHAN, ADEL, MUNIR,
