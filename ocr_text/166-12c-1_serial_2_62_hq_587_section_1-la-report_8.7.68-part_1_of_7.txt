AOR/alm

As previously reported, the facts of this case were
presented to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on June 7, 1968,
by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

As a result of the Grand Jury Hearing, an indictment
was rendered charging SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN with five counts
of attempt to commit murder and one count of murder.

On June 7, 1968, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was
arraigned in the Chapel facility of the Los Angeles County
Jail before Superior Court Judge ARTHUR L. ALARCON. In
this appearance, SIRHAN was represented by the office of
the Los Angeles County Public Defender and a date of plea
was set by the judge for June 28, 1968.

Also on June 7, 1968, Superior Court Judge ALARCON
issued a court order limiting publicity on and discussion of
this case as he indicated it was the duty of the court to
guarantee that the defendant received a fair trial.

WILBUR LITTLEFIELD, Chief Trial Attorney of the
Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office was named as the
defense counsel for SIRHAN.

On June 19, 1968, Los Angeles attorney RUSSELL E.
PARSONS was selected’ by SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN as his attorney
to replace WILBUR LITTLEFIELD of the Public Defender's Office.
PARSONS indicated that he would be assisted by a second attorney
wnose identity was not made known by PARSONS as this attorney
was allegedly currently engaged in trial. As of the date of
this report, RUSSELL E. PARSONS remains the only attorney of
record,

On June 28, 1968, SIRHAN BISHARA STRHAN, represented
by his attorney RUSSELL E. PARSONS, appeared before Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge RICHARD B. SCHAUER of Department 100, for
the purpose of plea. This appearance was held in the Chapel
of the Los Angeles County Central Jail for reasons of security.

At this hearing, an official substitution for the court was
made revealing RUSSELL E. PARSONS as the attorney of record
for SIRHAN. PARSONS requested a three-week delay which was
granted by the court and plea date was set for July 19, 1968.
At this appearance, SIRHAN waived his right in open court to
a trial within 60 days of indictment. Also at this appearance
the court appointed a second psychiatrist to examine SITRHAN
as one of the two original psychiatrists designated by the
court declined to examine him.

On July 7, 1968, SIRHAN was moved under heavy
security precautions from the Los Angeles County Central
Jail to the 13th floor of the Hall of Justice where he will
remain pending further court action.

On July 19; 1968, SIRHAN appeared in Department 100,
before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge RICHARD SCHAUER.
SIRHAN at this hearing was represented by his attorney, RUSSELL E.
PARSONS. The prosecution was represented by District Attorney
EVELLE J, YOUNGER and Chief Assistant District Attorney
LYNN COMPTON,

At this appearance, PARSONS requested and was granted
an extension for purpose of entering a plea on behalf of SITRHAN
until August 2, 1968, This motion was based on the fact that
PARSONS claimed he has not yet received a complete psychiatric
report from the two psychiatrists appointed by the court to
examine SIRHAN. Also, PARSONS requested and permission was
granted for Dr. RODERICK RICHARDON, a psychiatrist, to
continue further examination of SIRHAN and for Dr. EDWARD DAVIS
to conduct an encephalograph.

At this court appearance, District Attorney EVELLE J.
YOUNGER submitted to the court and to the defense attorney a
matter of motion which he intends to make on August 2, 1968, to
vacate or modify the previous court admonition against discussing
this case with news media and other unauthorized individuals.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

1 Date 7/9/68

Mrs. JUDITH FERNE ABO, wife of Dr. STANLEY ABO, who
resides at 1027 Acanto Place, telephone number 472-6058, was
interviewed by SA E. RHEAD RICHARDS, JR., concerning her account
of the things that occurred on June 4, 1968. .

Mrs. ABO advised that she and her husband, Dr. ABO,
who is a radiologist, were both at the Ambassador Hotel for
the ROBERT F. KENNEDY celebration proceedings on the evening
of June 4, 1968. She stated that they arrived at the hotel
at approximately 8:15 p.m. on that evening and that,almost
the entire evening,she and her husband both remained in the
Embassy Ballroom awaiting the appearance and victory speech
of Senator KENNEDY. She stated that shortly after midnight,
after Senator KENNEDY had made his victory remarks to the
group in the Embassy Ballroom, he left the ballroom by going
into a small room to the rear of the stage from which he had
made his remarks. She stated that she did not know which way
the Senator went after he left the stage but that a few moments
after he had left she heard what sounded like "balloons popping
first one or two and then several more."

She said that after thepopping noises she heard
people begin to shout that someone had been shot and then she
heard someone else say that Senator KENNEDY had been shot.
She stated that she first heard that he had been shot in the
leg and finally that he had been shot in the head.

Mrs. ABO advised that during the confusion the
shout was heard ,from the area of the shooting.for a doctor
to come to that area and so she encouraged her husband to go in.
She stated that he proceeded to enter the kitchen area where
the Senator was and he administered whatever aid and comfort
he could to Senator KENNEDY until the ambulance drivers arrived
and took the Senator to the Central Receiving Hospital.

Mrs. ABO stated that while her husband was with the
Senator she heard other people come from the kitchen yelling

for someone to get some icé and Since no one else responded

to the call, she herself ran from the Embassy Ballroom, past :
a fountain in the lobby and to a small bar near the lobby where
she obtained some ice. She stated that as she ran past the.
fountain in the lobby outside the Embassy Ballroom, she almost
bumped into two men,who appeared to her to be some type of hotel
security guards. There was another man a step or two behind
them and one of these guards yelled at her saying, "Hey lady,
don't you see this man is in handcuffs" She stated that as
she glanced up, the man,who appeared to. be in handcuffs and in
the custody of the other two nmen grinned at her with what she
described as an "insane grin"

Mrs. ABO advised that after obtaining the ice, she
went back to the Embassy Ballroom where a man took the ice
from her and took it into the kitchen area. She stated that
her husband finally came back to the Embassy Ballroom at
approximately 12:40 a.m. after having administered aid to the
Senator. She stated that he had blood on his hands and that
they walked through several parts of the hotel looking for a
place where he could wash his hands and clean up. She stated
that after he did this, they went to their car in the parking
lot where they had to wait for approximately one hour before
they were able to leave the lot and proceed to their home.

Mrs. ABO, at this point, stated that she did not feel
that the incident with the man in the handcuffs had anything to
do with the assassination of Senator KENNEDY but she mentioned
it only as it was one of the strange things that happened to
her on that evening.

Dr. STANLEY ABO advised that he resides at 1027
Acanto Place, Los Angeles, California, and that he is employed
as a radiologist in the X-Ray Department of the Midway Hospital
on San Vicente and Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles. He
stated that on the evening of June 4, 1968, he and his wife,
JUDITH, were both at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles as
campaigners and celebrants of the KENNEDY victory in the
California primary. Dr. ABO advised that they arrived at the
Ambassador Hotel at approximately 8:30 p.m. and remained there
the rest of the evening.

He said that at approximately midnight of June 4,
1968, he and his wife were in the Embassy Ballroom where
Senator KENNEDY was just finishing his victory remarks to
those campaigners present in the Embassy Room. He further
advised that the Senator finished his remarks and left the
stage of the Embassy Room through a door at the rear of the
stage. He, ABO, and his wife had just begun to move towards
the door of the Embassy Room when he heard several “popping”
noises, which he described as sounding like "balloons breaking
or light bylbs bursting." He advised that for some reason,
as he heard these noises,he mentally counted them and it seemed
to him that there had been seven reports. Dr. ABO said that
shortly after hearing these noises there was a commotion at
the door leading from the Embassy Room into the hallway, which
enters the kitchen area, and someone was heard to shout that
there had been some shooting and that Senator KENNEDY had been
shot. .

He stated that people began to shout for a doctor
and he went up to the doors leading out of the Embassy Room,
into the hallway,and informed several people there that he
was a doctor. He stated that a large unidentified Negro man
literally pushed him through the crowd into the pantry, or
kitchen area,where the wounded were located. He stated that
as he entered the pantry the first individual he noticed was
the man he believed to be Mr. SCHRADE, and he stated that he
briefly examined him and discovered a wound on his scalp but

determined the man was breathing normally and appeared to
be in no immediate danger. Dr. ABO said that .at this time;
several people asked him to please attend to Senator KENNEDY
inasmuch as he appeared to be injured quite seriously. Dr.
ABO stated that he went to the spot where Senator KENNEDY
was lying on the floor and as he first observed him he saw
that his right eye was open and staring, causing the doctor
to believe that some damage had been done to the brain area
which controlled that eye. He stated that the Senator's left
eye was ciosed and that his breathing appeared to be very
shallow. He advised that he reached for the Senator's mouth
with the idea of giving him some artificial aid in the breathing:
When he touched the Senator's face his left eye opened
and he looked at the doctor with a look that the doctor
interpreted as being one of "wondering who I was." The doctor
stated that when he saw the Senator's eye open,and what seemed
to him to be a comprehending look, he spoke to him and told
him that Mr. SCHRADE appeared to be all right. Dr. ABO stated
that Senator KENNEDY appeared to understand this statement and
once again closed his left eye.

Dr. ABO stated that he explored briefly the wound
in the Senator's head behind his ear and several times probed
the wound slightly in an attempt to prevent a build up of
"cranial pressure". He stated that he did no other active
treatment of the Senator but ,that during the time he was there,
his main goal was to determine the Senator's state of conscious-
ness and to keep other people from attempting to touch the
Senator,or administer any kind of aid to him.

Dr. ABO further advised that,a very few moments after
he had made this initial brief examination, Senator KENNEDY's
wife, ETHEL, walked up to him and gave him a bag of icé which
he applied to the Senator's head. He stated that at this time
the Senator once again opened his eye and seeing his wife, he
said "Oh, ETHEL" and reached up slightly and grasped her hand
and held it.

TA 56-156

Dr. ABO stated that in approximately 15 or 20 minutes
after he first arrived in the kitchen area, the ambulance
attendants arrived with a stretcher and began to move the ~—
Senator onto the stretcher. He stated that as they did this,
the Senator once neat opened his left eye and moaned loudly,
saying "No, no, oh no"

Dr. ABO advised that when the Senator had been
removed from the area, he briefly examined another young man
who had been snot in the thigh and,when he determined him to
be in fairly good condition, he went back to Mir, SCHRADE and
remained with him for several minutes.

He stated that at approximately 12:45 a.m., he finally
went back into the Embassy Room to look for his wife and he
saw another woman with a bloody forehead who was stretched out
on several of the chairs.She was being attended to by someone
whom he presumed to be a doctor. He stated that at this point
he was very emotionally shaken and upset and he did not make
any attempt to aid in the care of this woman. He added that
he then found his wife and they went to an area where he could
wash his hands,inasmuch as they were stained with blood.

After he had thus cleaned up a little bit, they went to
their car in the parking lot of the’hotel. He added that it
was approximately 45 minutes later before they were able to
leave the parking lot and proceed to their home.

Dr. ABO stated that it was his opinion that,during
the entire time that he was with Senator KENNEDY, the Senator
wag conscious and at least partly comprehending what was said
to him and what was happening. He stated that the Senator's
condition was not what he would describe as good but that his
condition did not deteriorate during the time that the doctor
was with him.

Dr. ABO advised that he could recall nothing further
that had happened on that evening.
