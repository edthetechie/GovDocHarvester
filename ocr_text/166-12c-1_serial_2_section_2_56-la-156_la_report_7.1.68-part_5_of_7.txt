"On June 16, 1968 TI was showen a group of six
photots by agents Bradford and Linker. I selected a
. photograph Of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan and I am positive
this is a photo of the man who inquired about 357 Mag.
tank piercing ammo on or about April 3, 1968.

"A photo of Adel Sirhan and Munir Sirhan have been
shown to me by the FBI on this date and both of these
men bear strong resemblance's to the men who were with
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan on or about April 3, 1968 __ in our

She explained each box contained 50 cartridges. The
"Col" refers to the manufacturer, Cascade Cartridge, Incorpora-
ted, Lewiston, Idaho. The "22" refers to .22 caliber cartridges.
According to the price of $1.00 per box the sale was for .22
caliber, long rifle, hollow point, mini-mag ammunition. She
explained the second two boxes would have been for .22 caliber,
long rifle, standard Super X, manufactured by the Winchester-
Western Division of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation. The
original, white copy, of the sales slip is kept by her firm
with the second tissue copy. The third copy, colored yellow,
is given to the customer as his receipt. Mrs. HERRICK advised

Mrs, HERRICK advised she would described the clothing
worn by all three men as being very similar as though they might
have been "in uniform clothing”. She stated, however, that she
did not observe any lettering on the clothing. She was impressed
with the fact that all three appeared to be "neat and clean".

In addition she advised that when she saw these three
men in their store on or about April 3, 1968, she and her hus-
band were the only ones working at the time. Her husband was
waiting on one other customer at the time. This was the only
other person in the store at the time but she advised she can
not recall the identity of this other customer,

Mrs. HERRICK advised she is unable to furnish any
other additional information at this time.

Mr. B Pentland, Temple City,
California, advised he is the owner of
the Lock, Stock, 'n arr ton Drive,
San Gabriel, California, . Mr. HERRICK

furnished the following signe

"San Gabriel, Calif.
June 17, 1968

"T Benjamin J. Herrick, make the following
statement to James H. Stanton and C. Kenneth Arnold
who have identified themselves to me as Special
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I
understand this statement may be used in a court of
law.

"TI have discussed with my wife, Dona, the events
surrounding the visit of three men, all foreign
appearing, to my gun shop, the Lock, Stock 'n. Barrel,
8972 Huntington Drive, San Gabriel, California, about
April 15, 1968. I now recall that three men entered
the store and looked around. My attention was drawn
to them because they were very interested in the
handgun display. I drew the impression that they
were foreign because of their interest in the display.
I have observed that other persons of foreign nation-
ality show unusual interest in gun displays, perhaps
because such displays are unknown in their own countries.

"T did not observe these three men until they
were in the store. I did not see them arrive in a
vehicle. I did see them when they approached my wife
and asked her a question and she then turned to me
for assistance. At this time one of them asked me
if we had any armor piercing ammunition in the store.
T do carry such ammunition which I sell to law enforce-
ment officers. After observing that these men were
not law enforcement officers I said that we did not
have such ammunition in stock. The three men then

left the store. I did not observe the men closely
on this visit and I now only recall that they were
short, dark and foreign looking.

"On June 1, 1968, I was again working at my
store. I don't recall the time of the incident,
but it was soinetime after opening hour of 12:00 noon.
I was talking to a customer about a shotgun. I do
not recall the name of this customer, but he was
interested in trap shooting and I think we were dis-
cussing a Browning over/under shotgun. During the
conversation I was standing near my desk in the north-
west corner of the store. Larry Arnot, one of my
employees, was standing at the ammunition counter
which is at the southwest corner of the store. I
happened to glance over my shoulder and observed
there were three short, dark, foreign looking persons
talking with him. From their appearance I thought
they were the same three persons who had been in the
store on the April 15th date inquiring about the armor
piercing ammunition. I observed these three persons
from the rear only. I continued my discussion with
my customer and when I finished the three men were
gone.

"I cannot give specific descriptions of the
three men because of the short period of time I had
to look at them. I believe they were all males, in
their early 20's, all about 5'5" or 5'6" (all shorter
than I at 5'6"), slender build, about 130 lbs. I
recall that they all were very dark complected. One
had kinky hair. The other two had curly hair. ‘They
were all wearing casual clothing, probably pants and
sport shirts. None of them had glasses, tattoos or
jewelry which I can recall. None of them was carrying
anything when they were in the store to the best of
my recollection. I have the impression they were all
clean, neat and well groomed.

"T recall discussing the nationality of the
three men, I remember someone saying they were
possibly Philipino. I commented that I did not
think they were Philipino because they had curly
hair and all Philipinos have straight hair. TI could
not identify any of the three men as being from a
middle east country.

"I have observed photographs of Adel Sirhan,
Sharif Bishara Sirhan, Saidallah Bishara Sirhan and
Munir Sirhan and cannot identify any of them as
being in the store.

"I cannot identify Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as one
of the three men in the store. I have seen his
photograph in the papers and on TV and cannot now
state that I am identifying him from being in my
store or from seeing his picture in the news media.

"T have read the above 2 page statement and to
the best of my knowledge it is true.

Date

LARRY KENNETH ARNOT, Salesman, Lock Stock '‘N Barrel
Gun Shop, 8972 East Huntingt: eC canyon
Road, Duarte, California, ma.
was interviewed at his employment.

ARNOT advised that sometime during the mid-afternoon
of June 1, 1968, three men entered the gun shop and walked
directly to the last counter on the south side of the building
where they momentarily paused and appeared to be looking
over the various boxes of ammunition which were located
behind that particular counter.

ARNOT stated that as he approached the three men
to inquire whether he could be of any assistance, the
shorter of the three men stated, "I want two boxes of
Mini Mags", or words to that effect. ARNOT stated that
simultaneously, one of the three separated himself from his
other two associates by a distance of approximately six to
eight feet and appeared to be intent on the items which were
located behind the counter on the west side of the building.

He related that as he turned towards the ammunition
stock, he asked the man who had ordered the "Mini Mags"
whether he desired the standard type or the hollow point type.

After learning that the purchaser desired the hollow
point, he obtained two boxes of high velocity .22 caliber
long rifle bullets, each box of which contained 50 shells.

On returning to the counter and placing the
ammunition directly in front of the purchaser, his associate,
who was standing along side him, then informed him that he
wanted two boxes of .22 caliber long rifle shells of the
standard type. ARNOT returned to the ammunition stock, removed
two boxes of .22 caliber Super X ammunition and, on returning
to the two men, placed all four boxes in a paper bag and then
proceeded to complete a sales invoice.

He related that on completing the sales which
totaled $3.99 including tax, he removed the yellow copy of
the three copy saies invoice from the sales book and placed
it in the bag with the four boxes of ammunition.

He advised that although not certain which one
of the two individuals paid him for the sales transaction,
he received the money, thanked them, at which point ail
three men departed the store leaving via the front door.

ARNOT also recalled that midway through the
course of the transaction, he asked the shorter of the two
men who had purchased the ammunition whether they planned
to go rabbit huating, as the .22 caliber bullets they were
buying appeared ideal to him for that type of game. He
advised th the shorter man acknowledged that that was their
plan, to which he asked, "Are you going toward Red Mountain",
which ARNOT explained was located off Highway 395 in San
Bernardino County, as ARNOT knew this area to be an excellent
rabbit hunting ground. ARNOT stated that he specifically
recalled that the shorter man answered in the negative and
cited another spot where they planned to go hunting but, at
this time, ARNOT cannot recall that location.

ARNOT stated that one or two days subsequent to
the shooting of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, he observed a
photograph of KENNEDY's alleged assailant SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN on either television or in a newspaper, at which
time he instantaneously realized that SIRHAN was the shorter
of the two men to whom he had sold the two boxes of "Mini
Mags" on June 1, 1968, while SIRHAN was in the company of
two associates.

At that point in the interview, ARNOT was displayed
the below listed photographs:

SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN

MUNIR SIRHAN

(Two photographs, one of which depicts

MUNIR with glasses, the other without glasses)

LA 56-156

ADEL SIRHAN
SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN
SAIDALLAH BISHARA SIRHAN

After closely reviewing the above photographs,
ARNOT identified the picture of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN as
being identical to the individual to whom he. had sold the
two boxes of .22 caliber, long rifle, high velocity shells
to on June 1, 1968. Upon completing his identification of
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, ARNOT affixed his initials and the
date of June 16, 1968, on the rear of this picture.

Continuing his review of the remaining four
photographs, ARNOT chose the photograph of SHARIF BISHARA
SIRHAN from the remaining pictures and advised that he was
of the opinion that SHARIF "bears a strong resemblance" to
the individual who, while standing next to SIRHAN in the
shop on June 1, 1968, ordered and purchased two boxes of
.22 caliber, long rifle, Super X bullets. ARNOT stated that
he could not make a positive identification of the photograph
of SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN but could be positive if afforded
the opportunity of viewing this individual in person,

Regarding the third individual who had entered the
store and then had parted from the other two men to view
other merchandise, ARNOT stated that he was not confident
that he would effect the identification of this person by
either photograph or in person viewing.

ARNOT was then displayed Lock Stock 'N Barrel
original sales invoice number 2372 which reflects the date
June 1, 1968, for a cash transaction of two boxes of CCT
.22 caliber ammunition and two boxes of Super X .22 caliber
ammunition with tax totaling $3.99. ARNOT identified the
writing upon this invoice as his own and advised that he believes
this is the sales slip covering the purchase made by SIRHAN
and his associate. After viewing the sales slip, ARNOT
affixed his initials to the document as well as the date
June 16, 1968. 593

At this point in the interview, ARNOT prepared
the following voluntary signed statement in his own hand:

"June 16_- 1968
San Gabriel California

"I, Larry Kenneth Arnot_ hereby furnish the
following signed statement to Norbert R. Linker and
B. Bruce Bradford who have identified themselves as
Special Agents of the F.B.I.

"IT am 36 years of age and reside at 517
Melcanyon Rd. Duarte_ California. I am employed
as a salesman at the Lock Stock 'N Barrel gun shop,
8972 E. Huntington Dr._ San Gabriel_ California,

"During the afternoon of June 1, 1968 3 men
entered my employment and walked to the rear of the
store where out stock of ammunition is located, Two
of the men remained positioned at the counter, their
associate parted from them at a distance of about
six feet and began to look over the items behind
another counter.

"One of two men standing together appeared
interested in the ammunition behind the counter.
After approaching them to inquire if I could be
any help the shorter of the two men responded by
stating 'I want two boxes of Mini Mags' or words to
that effect. On questioning he added that he wanted
the hollow point as opposed to the standard type.

I would like to point out at this time that 'Mini
Mag' is a brand or type of high velocity .22 caliber
ammunition of short, long or long rifle sizes.

"I obtained two boxes of hollow point .22
caliber high velocity, long rifle 'Mini Mags' made
by the Cascade Catridge Inc. of Lewiston_ Idaho
and placed them on the counter. Hach box contained
fifty cartridges.
