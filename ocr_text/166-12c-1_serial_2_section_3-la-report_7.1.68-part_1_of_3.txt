Pasadena, attended a reception for Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY¢on the Palm Terrace of the Ambassador Hotel from
the hours of 8:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., Sunday, June 2, 1968.

yealized that the person whom he had seen on the evening
of June 2, 1968, in the lobby o. the Ambassador Hotel

at the Show Case Liquor Company he casually greeted SIRHAN
with a brief salutation but never entered into any
lengthy discussions with him. He stated that from a distance

cultivate friendship with him.

“On Sunday, 6/2/68, a friend, David Vogel,
and I attended a reception for Senator Robert
Kennedy held on_the Palm Terrace of the Ambassador
Hotel, Los Angeles, between the hours of 8:30 p.m.
and 10:30 p.m. As Vogel and I approached the
doorway off the main lobby of the Ambassador which

"On turning bagk in the direction of the
Palm Terrace I may have commented to my friend,
David Vogel, that I knew the man that just passed,
but I am not sure of this point.

"At approximately noon, 6/5/68, I was
en route home in my car and was listening to
a Mr. John Weidner, the owner of Organic Pasadena
Food Company being interviewed on radio. Mr.
Weidner was identifying Sirhan Sirhan as a former
employee of his concern,

"I would like to point out that I was employed
as a stockboy at the Showcase Liquor's at 1374 North
Lake, Pasadena, from December, 1967 through March,
1968. The Showease Liquor Company adjoins Organic
Pasadena Company. During my four months of employment
I frequently observed a person later known to me as
SIRHAN SIRHAN working in and around Organic Pasadena.

"When Sirhan Sirhan's photographs were shown
on television on the evening of 6/5/63, I immediately
recognized him as the person who passed me at the

BLUME advised that DAVID VOGEL, a fellow senior
at John Muir High School, may regall the fact that as SIRHAN
passed them he turned toward VOGEL and commented with
words to the effect "I know that guy".

Additionally, BLUME advised that subsequent
to the shooting of Senator KENNEDY, he had occasion to
talk to Mrs. SHIRLEY MC CONNEL, the mother of a fellow
classmate of his, SUSIE MC CONNEL, age 18. He advised
that during this discussion Mrs. MC CONNEL related that she
had heard a rumor that a Mr. JOSEPH E. JACOBS of 2149 North
El Molino, Altadena, California, was understood to have
regularly driven SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN to either John Muir

Way, San Gabriel, California, who is employed at the Fluor
Corporation, 6045 East Slauson Boulevard, Los Angeles,
advised he did not know SIRHAN SIRHAN, had never met him, and
the only person he knew who might possibly know him was
SPEAR SAYEGH, a Christian Jordanian who works for the GPS
Pharmacy on Las Tunas Boulevard in Temple City. He stated
SAYEGH heads a charitable organization, called the U. S.
Omen, which raises money and sends’ it to charities in the
middle east. BAHTISHI denied making any anti-KENNEDY statements
in connection with the assassination of Senator KENNEDY. He
stated Senator KENNEDY was generally well regarded by Arabs
in connection with his stand in the Middle East, and because
of the position of his brother, President JOHN F. KENNEDY, had
taken. He stated all the Arabs he knew felt badly about the
action of SIRHAN SIRHAN, as it reflected on them. He pointed
out that emotional statements might have been made by people
concerning Senator KENNEDY because this is an election year,
but was sure such statements would be made concerning politics,
rather than concerning the individual. He knew of no anti-
KENNEDY statements which had been made.

BAHTISHI denied belonging to any Arab club, but
stated he was aware there were such clubs on the campus at
the University of Southern California and at the University
of California at Los Angeles. He said he understood the
Organization of Arab Students which had been active on the
campus at California State College, Los Angeles, had been
disbanded. He stated the primary purpose of the clubs was
to provide a social outlet and orientation for arriving
Arab students, and had no political purpose of which he was
aware. He stated such clubs usually had a faculty advisor.

BAHTISHI stated he had attended Pasadena City College
on an irregular basis, taking a class or two at night, in
the Fall of 1965 and the Spring of 1966. He stated he never
met or knew SIRHAN through this attendance.

BAHTISHI stated the name MUSTAFA was another name

CHARLES WILLIAM HENEBRY, 12000 La Manda, Los Angeles,
California, telephone 390-3020, retired, advised the following:

Mr. HENEBRY claimed that he was formerly employed in
the Foreign Service by the United States Department of State
at Washington, D.c., for a period of 16 years and was given
a disability retirement on December 31, 1966 due to health.

He had been given general assignments and had worked in the
Visa Office and Ammunition Controls. He had spent a number of
years on assignments in the Middle East, particularly in

Traqg.

During the past few weeks, Mr. HENEBRY had been
a volunteer worker for the Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY campaign
at the latter's Los Angeles headquarters at 5615 Wilshire
Boulevard.

Following the shooting of Senator KENNEDY, and the
arrest of SIRHAN SIRHAN charged with shooting the senator on
June 5, 1968, there had been some speculation among former
workers in the KENNEDY Headquarters, now closed, that SIRHAN
SIRHAN may have been at the headquarters as a volunteer worker
within the past few days. He recalled specifically that
ELLENORE SEVERSON who worked on the information desk and
LARRY STRICK, a general assistant volunteer worker at the
headquarters, had reported that they thought that they had
observed a person closely resembling SIRHAN SIRHAN in the KENNEDY
headquarters.

Photographs of STRHAN SIRHAN taken by the Los Angeles
Police Department on June 5, 1968, were exhibited to Mr. HENEBRY
who said that while the photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN looked like
the young man he had seen at the KENNEDY headquarters within the
last two or three days but he could not be positive.

Mr. HENEBRY mentioned that there had been a number
of young people volunteer workers at the headquarters who

appeared to be of Middle East descent and that they had been
prought into the headquarters by one KHAIBAR KHAN who had
showed up there around June 1, 1968. KHAN, who claimed to
be from Iran, had engaged Mr. HENEBRY from time to time in
some conversation. KHAN spoke fluent English with a slight
accent. He appeared to be about 55 years of age, male
Caucasian, complexion not too dark, clean shaven, black hair,
graying, five feet six inches to five feet seven inches,
stocky build, wore long sideburns, strong facial features,
dressed like a Hollywood film character actor. On one occasion
Mr. HENEBRY noted him wearing a turtleneck sweater.

It was recalled that Mrs. MARGARET SWEENEY who
handled the headquarters office had brought KHAN to
Mr. HENEBRY and introduced hin.

KHAN, on at least one or two occasions, was
accompanied by a young female Caucasian, about 23 years of
age, five feet four inches, dark hair, attractive. She
appeared to have more Caucasian features than Middle East
features. This girl, who was described as a sister by
Mr. KHAN, was seated most of the day when working. She
used modern aluminum crutches and held one leg up. This
leg was not ina cast.

Mr. KHAN claimed that he had been flying around
to various Senator KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters and mentioned
that he had a crew of approximately 20 young people which he
had brought to headquarters to work for Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. KHAN worked late at the headquarters on election
day, June 4, 1968, and said that he did not think he would go
to the campaign party at the Ambassador Hotel that night.

Mr. HENEBRY said that he could speak and understand
Arabic and that while he did not have too much contact with
Mr. KHAN, the latter seemed to be friendly because of their
common knowledge of Middle East languages.

TA 56-156

On the evening of June 5, 1968, Mr. KHAN called
Mr. HENEBRY at the latter's residence and discussed briefly
the tragic event involving Senator KENNEDY and suggested
that he, Mr. KHAN, and Mr. HENEBRY go out to dinner.
Mr. HENEBRY declined and thought it somewhat unusual that
KHAN would ask him out to dinner under the circumstances
and on such short acquaintance. Mr. KHAN mentioned that he
had to go to San Francisco on business and was expected to
return to Los Angeles in a couple of days.

With respect to the young man at the KENNEDY

Headquarters who somewhat resembled SIRHAN SIRHAN,

Mr. HENEBRY said that he was one of the group that had been
brought in by Mr. KHAN but that this young man appeared to
be too large for the description of SIRHAN STRHAN published
in the newspaper. Mr. HENEBRY described the young man who
resembled STRHAN SIRHAN's photograph as being about 20 years
of age, close to five feet ten inches in height, and weighing
150 pounds plus.

Mr. KHAN had asked Mr. HENEBRY for the latter's
name and address which had been furnished to him and Mr. KHAN
had furnished an address at the headquarters of 105544
Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.

Mr. HENEBRY, following examination of a photograph
of SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN, taken December 18, 1963, and of
ADEL SIRHAN, taken June 5, 1968, both brothers of SIRHAN
SIRHAN, said he could not identify the photograph with any
persons who had worked or been seen at the Senator KENNEDY
Campaign Headquarters or elsewhere.

PHILLIP M. SMITH, SR., M.D., home address, 510 East
Englander, Gardena, California, was interviewed at his office
located at 8500 South Figueroa, Los Angeles, California, and
furnished the following information:

Dr. SMITH advised that on June 4, 1968, he was watching
Senator KENNEDY's victory speech on television with LEON RAPH,
Assemblyman, 55th District at RAPH's Headquarters, located
103rd Street, near Willowbrook in Watts. Dr. SMITH advised
that when it came on television that Senator KENNEDY had been
shot, he and LEON RAPH immediately got into their vehicles and
drove to the Ambassador Hotel. Dr. SMITH advised that he and
RAPH arrived in the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 1 AM, on
June 5, 1968, and immediately after arriving at the Ambassador
went direct to the Presidential suite. He advised that when
they arrived at the Presidential suite, he talked with CHARLES
EVERS and ROOSEVELT GRIER, Football player for the Los Angeles
Rams and Congressman REESE and several other individuals unknown
to him. Dr. SMITH advised that there were no comments made
about the shooting that he heard while at the Presidential
suite other than several of the individuals were praying that
Senator KENNEDY was not hurt bad. He advised that ROOSEVELT
GRIER was setting in a chair and seemed to be an a trance and
outside of saying hello he did not mention anything about the
shooting which had happened earlier.

Dr. SMITH advised that he and LEON RAPH stayed at the
Ambassador Hotel at the Presidential suite until sometime between
4. AM and 5 AM, because someone had come into the Presidential
suite and stated that no one could leave. Dr. SMITH advised that
he had not been questioned at the Ambassador Hotel by anyone and
that between 4 and 5 AM it was evident that he or LEON RAPH
could not be of any assistance so they departed the Ambassador
Hotel and went home.

Dr. SMITH was shown a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
taken June 5, 1968, Los Angeles Police Department No. 495 139
and advised that this individual was unknown to him.

On June 6, 1968, Lieutenant R.A, SLAGHT, Pomona Police
Department made available a copy of a report pertaining to infor~
mation furnished the Department by a Mr. LE BEAU, an employee or
Robbie's Restaurant in Pomona.

GILBERT RICHARD LE. BEAU, 1712 East Princeton Street,
Ontario, California, telephone 936-2822, employed at Robbie's
Restaurant, 390 Pomona Mall East, telephone NA 3-2671, was contacted
at 7:10 PM on June 6, 1958, at Robbie's where he is employed
as a bartender. Mr. LE BEAU stated that after watching news
broadcasts regarding the attempt on Senator KENNEDY's life,
the description of the suspect brought to mind a person that was
present during the Senatortg visit to Pomona.

Immediately upon seeing the suspected person's picture
in the paper Mr. LE BEAU recognized the person to be the same as
the man he had contact with at the restaurant. He stated he
had positioned himself on the stairway leading to the room where
the Senator was to give a luncheon speech, While at this location
he observed the man identified as the suspect and a female
companion climb over a planter at the location and approach the
location he was guarding and began shoving against him and
attempting to get past him and up the stairway that the
Senator had just entered. Mr. LE BEAU stopped this motion by
holding the female subject back, who was being pushed from behind
by the suspect. The woman told him that "we are with the Senator's
party and he just waved for us to come up". Mr. LE BEAU
reluctantly allowed them to pass although they could not
show any tickets to the affair.

His second contaci with these people was when he observed
them in the luncheon room while KENNEDY was making a speech.
He stated they were standing together, the male suspect leaning
up against the south wall of the location carrying a cream
colored unknown type coat draped over his right forearm. He
approached this suspect and stated "Pardon Me", The suspect
looked at him and stated "Why should I". The suspect at this
point looked away and Mr. LE BEAU turned and walked away. This
was Mr. LE BEAU's last recollection of the suspect and his
female companion.

‘tuncheon. After all persons were: seated and
Senator-Kennedy had entered the restaurant and
gone upstairs I then allowed the standing room
crowd to go upstairs. Tickets were required from
these persons also. .

"Prior to allowing the standing room crowd
up the stairs I was told not to let anyone up
the stairs until Senator Kennedy cleared the
stairs and the luncheon room upstairs. After he
did so, I was then told to allow the people up.

"I recall letting one older man up the
stairs after taking his ticket. A moment or
so later I allowed a few other persons with
tickets through.

"I recalled then hearing a noise of
someone apparently hitting their foot on the
stair behind me. I looked around and saw a
young woman on the stairs behind me about two
steps up. She had to climb over the stair
rail from a booth and a brick flower casing
against the stairs in order to get behind me.
I saw a man coming over the rail and dropping
onto the stairs behind the girl.

"T stepped up on the next stair and grabbed
the girl with my right arm to prevent her from
moving up the stairs. She was facing up the
stairs at the time. In grabbing her with my right
arm I recall ending up with my right hand on her
left breast accidentally.

"I asked the question of both the girl and
the man, "Do you have tickets".

"The girl answered "We are part of the
Senator's party".

"I asked again "But do you have tickets?"

"During this brief encounter the man said
nothing but he was continously pushing on her
back.

"Tt then let the two of them go and
returned to the bottom of the stairs.

"Following this I let the remainder of
the ticket holders go up the stairs.

"During the address made by Senator
Kennedy et the luncheon at approximately 1 PM
Iwas upstairs for the purpose of locating a
runner for one of the newsmen present and I
recalled having seen the same man and woman
standing against the south wall of the room where
Kennedy was making his address.

The podium from which Kennedy spoke was set
against the east wall of the room.

"On seeing the couple, it occurred to me
that they were not a part of the Senator's
party in view of their location.

"after finding the runner I was seeking
in the vicinity of the south wall, the two of
us turned to leave the luncheon room, I bumped
accidentally into the man who - was with the girl
mentioned previously.

"IT recalled saying, "Pardon me”.

"He said "Why should 1?"

"I ignored his remark and left the room.

Officer CARL F, JACKSON, Pomona, California Police
Department, advised that on May 20, 1968, when a reception was
held for Senator KENNEDY at Robbie's Restaurant on the Pomona
Mall during the noon hour, that he was stationed inside the
restaurant on the first floor in the vicinity of the stairs
leading to the second area where the luncheon reception was held.

He recalled that when Senator KENNEDY and his party
started up the stairs to the second floor that Senator KENNEDY
stopped momentarily on the stairs and pointed a finger to
Officer SCHNEID who was holding back a crowd away from the foot
of the stairs and saying to Officer SCHNEID "Let them through”.
JACKSON related that this remark apparently referred to a couple
in the crowd being held back by SCHNEID who he believed to have
been part of the KENNEDY party. To the best of his recollection
one of these persons would have probably been STEVE SMITH,
brother-in-law of Senator KENNEDY, or someone resembling SMITH.

It was his recollection that this person then made his
way to the area of the foot of the stairs and got onto the
stairs themselves by being forced to climb over the north rail of
the stairs because of the crowd at the base of the stairs.

JACKSON recalled also that there was a girl standing
by the kitchen door adjacent to Officer SCHNEID and apparently
Officer SCHNEID had had some words with this girl. He recalled
that a moment or so later this same girl was observed by hin
as being on the stairs and apparently having been detained by
one of the persons taking up tickets at the foot of the
stairs, however, JACKSON said he had no recollection of any man
being with this girl.

He related that he saw no one in the crowd around the
stairs who resembled photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN,

JACKSON described the woman as follows:

hour. On this date and at this time there was a reception held
for Senator KENNEDY in the upstairs portion of the restaurant.

He stated that he was stationed in uniform in the ‘aisle
leading to the rear door at the southeast end of the building
holding back the crowd away from the stairs leading to the
second floor luncheon area.

Just prior to Senator KENNEDY and his party moved up
the stairs to the second floor, he recalled having noticed a
girl in her mid 20's standing by the kitchen door on the west
side of the corridor. It was his recollection that this girl -
apparently was trying to get into the kitchen. SCHNEID said . ;
he told her that she could not go in there. He recalled her asking
him which way Senator KENNEDY was coming in and was told he would’
probably go up the stairs to the second floor.

SCHNEID related that when the KENNEDY party did go up
the stairs that Senator KENNEDY stopped midway and pointed at
him and said to him "Officer, Let them through". SCHNEID related
that KENNEDY was referring to the people in the aisle that he ©
was trying to hold back. As soon as Senator KENNEDY said this,
SCHNEID said that the crowd st¥rged toward the foot of the stairs
and that he was forced to step aside. :

At this time, SCHNEID. recalled that the girl mentioned
previously by him bolted toward the area at the foot of the
stairs and moved into the booth area on the north side of the
staircase instead of trying to get up the stairs herself. It was
his impression that she was trying to get to someone she might
have recognized in that area.

Within possibly a minute later, SCHNEID recalled seeing
the sme girl on the stairs themselW§, He said that it was his
impression that someone might have helped her over the brick
facade adjacent to the stairs and over the stair railing behind

persons including: Mr. POLACHECK, owner of Brand Jewelers;
Mr. BIRNBAUM, owner of Zale's Jewelers; and Mr. and Mrs.

Mrs. BRONS stated that when she left the Country
Club, she saw a 1956 faded dusty rose DeSoto parked near the

Mrs. BRONS was shown a photograph of SIRHAN's 1956
DeSoto and she stated'this car was not identical to the car
she saw.

Mrs. BRONS was shown a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN
and stated the photograph resembled the man she saw at the

tie.

CBS News of the above and aiso furnished it to one of WREN's
staff. She stated she did not trust any of the local
authorities and proceeded to criticize the Los Angeles

the FBI in the past to report a possible racial incident and
gambling activities and had recently contacted the Long Beach
Resident Agency regarding her views on gun control
legislation.

KENNEDY seek the presidency of the United States.
