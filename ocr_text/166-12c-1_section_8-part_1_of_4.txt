Dear Mr. Nixon,

Three years or so ago, a character named Sirhan Sirhan,
boldly shot Senator Robert Kennedy in front of several -ride-
eyed witnesses, yet this murderer is still kicking around
some cozy jail, waiting for his greedy lawyers (I bet the
lawyers are of the typical Jewish brand, too) to perform
a bis miracle.

dust what the hell is the matter. Some people should
be entitled to an attorney, but a very obvious criminal
like Sirhan should be taken care of in a hurry by some
competent judge, magistrate or even somebody in an author-
ative position like yourself - too hell with the red
tapes

Once you Americans start having logical justice and not
loophole justice, T think you will find reonle regaining a
good portion of their lost sanity, self-respect and security.

Remember, if people think and behave logically there
will be a much plensanter existence,

I am not fooling.

Tom Kanee

Dear President Nixon, FRLE-F ~

My name is Susan Weinberg, I am 14 years old, I go fo
Mark Twain Junior High School in Venice California.

I just got through listening to the new record called,
"What the worid needs now." In it it talks about how Martin
Luther king was assassinated, how John Kennedy was assass-—
inated,and how Robert Kennedy was assassinated. I heard on
this record that when a man asked a child what hatred, bigotry

and segregation is, the child did not know! At the end of the

record the man asked the child if he knew what prejudice is,
the child said, "I think it means when somebody is sick,"
and that child is absolutely right!!! A11 through“ihat
record I cried and cried! Please tell me wey, these peadae
must do this??? What about Sirhan Sirhan? ‘thy people “Oy
of the United States are paying for his food and * pon tte
and most probably he has an air conditioned cell!! Weer
know that he assassinated Kobert Kennedy,in the meantime

he is living instead of Robert Kennedy!! Don't you think

it should have been the other way around??? Why is

this man, no not a man , an animal still living? tknow ~ \
this is only one person that is talking out but can't you, do \W)
something about it. All Sirhan Sirhan is doing is noting but oN
wasting our parents and our money. “ ah oeiN HRIME Seu,

I know you could do something about it.if you really
really tried! You have helped many many people before!
Try and help the citizens of this great country that you are
president of!!!! I HAVE GREAT PAIZH IN your!!!

Honorable Sir:

It seems to me a great disservice to the American
people not to have electrocuted the murderer of Robert
Kennedy. His being able to stay alive only invites
other persons to shoot and kill politicians or
respected leaders of our nation.

Only courageous little Israel shows the strength

and conviction of how to handle murderers and blackmailers.
When too shall American leaders show the courage of
putting these people in the electric chair where they
rightfully belong?

Respectfully

This is in response to your correspondence

City, Oklahoma, concerning the Sirhan Sirhan trial.
Please excuse my delay in replying.

Mr. Sirhan was charged with an offense against
the State of California. He was therefore prosecuted
in the Courts of that State and not by the federal
government. Since we have not been involved in the
prosecution nor advised as to the expenses ixvolved,
I suggest that Mr. Hulsey may wish to seek the
desired information from the appropriate California
officiais.

Your enclosures are returned herewith.

Mr. Jerris Leonard

I was told that you don't due anything in any cases, but
I did't believe it well I know now that you don't administer
any Justice. I talked te A Attorney, and he said that you don't
due anything in any cases, well I know now that you don't. I
also know is is legal to kill someone through Social Security
Administrations, To form a society the way they see fit. I give
up, I ence was a happy person, And Your Social Security is on
a Federal level, and to achieve justice is a remote possibility.
What your saying in effect is that you don't administer any
justice at all, just pass the buck to know wheirs land. I was
dam near killed through a federal media. I was told that you
don't due anything in any cases, I now believe that. Just another
due nothing Bureau in Washington. Ipersonaly beleive that you
should be removed from you due nothing Bureau the Just Ice Department
and relieve the tax payers ef the expense of due nothing Bureaus
such as yours. Because when it gets right down to brass tacks
you pass the buck. 0.K. So you don't due anything but let your
Social Security Administrations form the society in which we
live. I trouty don't want to live in society wheir you are
controled. P.S. I don't want to live anymore.
