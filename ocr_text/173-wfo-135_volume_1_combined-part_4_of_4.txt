THREAT TO ASSASSINATE SENATOR

EDWARD KENNEDY, SAN FRANCISCO,

CALIFORNIA, JUNE 10, 1968
On June 10, 1968, LEROY

Day Clerk, George Hotel
pHoward Street, San Fr ‘orn telep cheathe?
BI office to advise that a note was found the outgoing
mail box at the hotel signed by IGNACIO 0. LOPEZ, Room 302,
which was addressed "Mailman, give this to/a police, please."
The contents of the note read as follows: /

OSBORNE

"There are people wandering around the place where I live
shouting out they are going to do the same thing to Ted Kennedy.
They speak in Spanish and sometimes in English but generally in
Spanish. I live at George Hotel, Howard and 5th. I only want
to be in peace with myself if something will happen.

(Sgd.)} Ignacio 0. Lopez".

LOPEZ was not available for interview this date, nor could
anyone be located who knew where he was employed or could be

_veached.

OSBORNE made available the note, which was given to Special
Agent LARRY NEWMAN, U. 8. Secret Service, 450 Golden Gate Avenue,
San Francisco, at the time this information was furnished orally

to him... June 10, 1968, at 2:30 P.M.

OSBORNE stated his records show that LOPEZ had registered at
the hotel on May 9, 1968, and listed his home as Miami, Florida,
He said that LOPEZ had lived at the hotel since that time and did
not appear to be an itinerant type of person as he had received
letters from A. H. GARCIA, 2184 N. Kedzie, Chicago, Illinois, and
A. ORDETY, 10916 - 28th, Tampa, Florida, among others.

OSBORNE was unable to identify who the Spanish-speaking
persons referred to in the note might be ag many of the residents
of the hotel, as well as the general area, speak Spanish.

This information was also furnished to BEN LASHKOFF, Intelli-
gence Unit of the San Francisco Police Department. on 6/10/68 at 3
