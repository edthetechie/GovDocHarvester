the settlement, and about two weeks prior to the shooting,
STRHAN had come into the auto parts store to buy items

for his car. At this time, he had a large roll of bills,
including some hundred dollar bills. GARCIA stated SIRHAN
liked to bet on horse races, but stated that at that time
he had lost too much money, and was no longer betting on
races.

GARCIA volunteered the opinion there was no conspiracy
on the part of SIRHAN and anyone else, since the whole
shooting seemed so poorly planned. He stated he was sure
conspirators would have chosen a gun of a larger caliber,
and would have tried to arrange a better location and better
escape route. Because of the apparent lack of planning,
GARCIA believed there was no premeditation on the part
of SIRHAN, and believed SIRHAN went to the reception
with the gun, and conceived his plan on the spur of the
moment.

GARCIA stated that were it not for SIRHAN's
apparent action, he would still consider him a good,
close friend, whom he respected and admired. GARCIA
stated he was puzzled by SIRHAN's action, as he had
neverknown him to violate other laws of any kind.

ROBERT G. COMFORT, who resides at 95 North Holliston,
Pasadena, California, was interviewed at 18 North Mentor and
advised that he was the publisher and editor of a periodical
called "Small Comfort" and worked as bar manager at the
Ice House located on North Mentor in Pasadena. COMFORT
advised he had attended Pasadena City College in the spring
of 1964 through 1965. He stated that during this time he
had been acquainted with SIRHAN SIRHAN. COMFORT advised that
on occasion SIRHAN would have coffee with a group of students
and they would engage in a general conversation. COMFORT
advised that during these conversations numerous topics would
come up and that he could not specifically recall exact
statements of SIRHAN. COMFORT advised that he did remember
that SIRHAN had stated a contempt for the idea of Isréél but
not toward the Jewish people. COMFORT advised that he remembered
a Jewish boy being a regular in this group and that SIRHAN
never voiced opposition or disdain for this individual.
COMFORT stated that it was his impression that SIRHAN did not
hold the rich in contempt and that SIRHAN had respect for the
idea that persons with ability could acquire material
possessions and live better than persons with lesser abi.ity.

COMFORT advised that generally SIRHAN was usually
withdrawn and that it appeared that SIRHAN desired to be
accepted. COMFORT stated that SIRHAN was not at a loss to
express his belief in Arab Nationalism and if the topic came
up he would participate. COMFORT stated that on occasion
the group would bait SIRHAN because his views on the subject
were known by the more frequent members of the coffee group.

COMFORT further advised that SIRHAN did not like
the idea of the establishment and the reteration of the
individual to being no more than a number. COMFORT further
advised that it was his impression that SIRHAN sought to be
accepted by this group even to the extent that SIRHAN would
sometimes buy coffee for everyone.

COMFORT advised that his only other contact with
SIRHAN was when SIRHAN worked for a Richfield Service Station

in Pasadena and he (COMFORT) would have his car serviced
or just stop by to get some free work done.

COMFORT advised that SIRHAN would not probably
consider him a friend because their contact was infrequent.

COMFORT advised that in the July 2, 1968, issue
of his magazine, "Small Comfort", he intended to print a
story about his impressions of SIRHAN SIRHAN and the KENNEDY
assassination. COMFORT stated that he had no profound insights
to offer and that his purpose in writing was to point out
the need for every individual to get involved in current
mattews so that in the future protests will not take the form
of assassins bullets.

COMFORT furnished a copy of his article. COMFORT
advised that the following paragraph is the only part which
reflects his factual knowledge of SIRHAN:

"tT went to school with SIRHAN. We weren't fast
friends, but I remember him. We shared no classes,
but he often sat at our table during breaks. I
sometimes went to the service station where he worked
evenings; to scrounge cans of STP for my sickly
car, and to talk with him. He was a little guy with
the top button on his shirt undone so the hair on his
chest stuck out. He was friendly. Eager enough for
acceptance that he'd buy coffee for everybody at the
table. Maybe not so much for acceptance as the
indication of a generous nature--I don't know. He was
articulate without being pushy. The only time he
raised his voice were the times the Middle East
situation was the topic of discussion. He was from a
refugee background and was, therefore, considered unfit
company by the rest of the Arab students; most of whom
were the offspring of monied middle-east establishment
parents. He disliked them for their smugness; they

"rejected him. In our group there was no one who
didn't like STRHAN, but no one who liked him well
enough to be his friend. He asked a few girls for
dates, but none accepted., 'He's a nice guy,' they'd
say when he was gone, 'but I'd feel so funny if I
went out with him.' They'd make a small face then
or laugh. That's all I knew about him. He thought
WASSER was a great man. He hated the ideas of Isreal--
but not the Jew who sat at our table. STRHAN SIRHAN.
He was tiny. He wanted very much to be liked. He
was lonely."

Mrs. ELEANOR JOHNSON, 1255 Morada Place, Altadena,
California, was interviewed approximately 10:30 a.m., Sunday
June 9, 1968, regarding the present whereabouts of MAJED GUSSOUS.
Mrs. JOHNSON had no knowledge of GUSSOUS and indicated that no
Areb students had lived at this address since some time prior
to her moving to'this address in 1964.

In the afternoon of the same date, Mrs. JOHNSON
called the FBI, Los Angeles, and asked that the agent who had
interviewed her call her back.

On the second contact, Mrs. JOHNSON said that an
hour or two after the interview by the agent, two persons, a
men and a woman, came to her house. First a man came to the door,
but she was not at home, and he left (according to her children).
Then a woman, who according to her children was with the man,
came to the door alone. Mrs. JOHNSON was home at this time.
The woman was dressed in a white nurse's uniform. She was
fairly young with dyed blonde hair. She was very nervous.
She said her name was TOSTI or TASTI or TOSTO (phonetic). She
first said she was a friend of SIRHAN then amended this to say
she had worked with him in a health food store at one time.
She then said the purpose of her call was to locate ABDEL MAJED
BASS, a Jordanian who knew SIRHAN and who used to live at this
address. The woman said that she wanted to ask BASS what he
knew about SIRHAN. Mrs. JOHNSON thought the woman's behavior
was rather strange. Prior to leaving, the woman gave Mrs.
JOHNSON a telephone number, SY 8-2719, where she could be
reached.

of the investigation. FULTON furnished the following in-
formation:

FULTON stated that he is acquainted with SIRHAN
BI. SHARA SIRHAN, He advised he first met SIRHAN at the
"Student Union Coffee Shop’ on the campus at Pasadena City
College, Pasadena, California about September, 1964. He
said that he could not recall the last time that he saw
SIRHAN but it was sometime prior to December 1965, because
this is when he (FULTON) left City College. FULTON de-
scribed his relationship with SIRHAN as a "campus acquaintance"
in that he did not socialize with SIRHAN off campus,
advising that he did not go to SIRHAN's house, nor did
SIRHAN ever come to his house. He advised that his conver-
sations with SIRHAN were usually held in the coffee shop
during breaks or between, after or before classes. During
these conversations, FULTON recalls discussions of Arab and
Israel conflict, at which time SIRHAN had expressed his
dissatisfaction with the administration and the newspapers
because he believed that they sided with Israel. FULTON
described SIRHAN as an introvert and @ loner. He advised
that SIRHAN never exhibited a tendency towards violence while
in his presence. He advised that SIRHAN's reaction was that
of an individual who was loyal to his country. FULTON advised
that SIRHAN was very devoted to Jordan and it was his,
(FULTON's) opinion, based on conversation with SIRHAN, that
SIRHAN eventually wanted to return to Jordan.

FULTON said that he is sure that politics were discussed
during conversations with SIRHAN but he could not recall SIRHAN'S
mentioning his political views, party or specific political
candidate.

FULTON denied he commuted to and from college with

occasions, in an old model Cadillac (year and color unknown)
owned by SIRHAN but was unable to recall where he went during
these rides, with SIRHAN or the circumstances involved.

December 1965. He said that while attending college, he
resided at 2446 East Washington Boulevard, Pasadena, California,

from school although on occasion his cousin, RICHARD HUTTON,
would pick him up or drop him off at home. FULTON stated
that he did not know where SIRHAN lived.

He said that he recalled that SIRHAN worked at a
service station at night while attending college. He could
not recall the name of the station but it is located ona
main street, one block north of Colorado Street, running
parallel to Colorado Street, and east of the front entrance
of Pasadena City College. FULTON further advised that he
believed that SIRHAN was a member of some type of foreign
club (name unknown) on the campus of City College.

FULTON stated that after he quit Pasadena City
College, he enlisted in the United States Army and entered
on duty February 21, 1966, at Fort Polk, Louisiana for boot
camp. He completed his training on April 30, 1966 and then
returned home on a fourteen-day leave. He then, after the
leave, reported to Redstone Arsenal, where he arrived
approximately May 14 and has been there ever since. FULTON
advised he was at home on leave from March 6, 1968 through
March 18, 1968, his most recent return to California. FULTON
said that he did not see or talk to SIRHAN during his leave
in 1958 or in 1966.

FULTON stated that usually the conversations with

-TERRENCE A. FELL, 1103 North Catalina, Pasadena,
California, was interviewed at the office of the FBI. FELL
said that he is attached to the 115th Group of the U.S. Army
and is assigned to Military: Intelligence stationed at the
Presidio of San Francisco. His residence in the bay area is
400 Canal Street, Apartment 311, San Rafael, California, .
telephone number 453-6021. His telephone number at the
Presidio is 561- 3242, : .

FELL stated that he is acquainted with SIRHAN SIRHAN,
having met him in 1957 when he, SIRHAN, first came to this ~
country with his family. SIRHAN was approximately four years ~
older than the other boys, but was attending the same grade at
Longfellow Elementary School at Washington and Catalina Streets
in Pasadena. |

After leaving the elementary school, FELL said that
SIRHAN and he attended different junior high schools, but
maintained occasional contact with a mutual friend, DAVOR
PEVEC. FELL said PEVEC had much closer contact with SIRHAN
as they both were aliens. PEVEC was a Croatian and SIRHAN an
Arab. .

‘ Concerning PEVEC, FELL said he resides at 1120 North
Mentor in, Pasadena and attends school at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. He works part time for the Market
Basket ,. 1216 North Lake Street, Pasadena, California. He is =
not aware of the residence address of PEVEC in Santa Barbara,
“but believes that he possibly. may be out of school for this
semester.

: FELL said that he and STRHAN attended the same college,
Pasadena City College, but did not have any classes together.
He said that he believes the last time he saw him was either in
1964 or 1965 and thinks the occasion .was when the Shah of Iran
was visiting this country. He is not aware of any political
inclinations of SIRHAN, ‘except that he was very much interested
in the conflicts between the Arab and.Israeli nations. He was

very pro-Arabic and often spoke of going back to his homeland
and helping out in the war.

FELL said that he recalls one occasion when they were
in either the 6th or 7th grade, when they were playing Monopoly
or some other game, that SIRHAN commented how he felt toward
the Jewish people. | He had apparently seen a close member of.
his family killed in Jordan and desired to go back some day to
his homeland. :

FELL said that in 1964 or 1965, when he last saw SIRHAN
that FELL's father had the responsibility for the itinerary of
the Shah of Iran and is fairly certain that this is the time he
saw SIRHAN because he believed that he was going to attend a ,
function or a rally where the Shah was to appear. He is some-
what hazy on this incident but believes that SIRHAN was in
support of the Shah. .

On one other occasion PELL said that PEVEC told him
that SIRHAN did not desire to become a citizen. PEVEC had
become a citizen after he had been in this country five years,
but apparently SIRHAN did not want to do this, indicating that he
someday wanted to return to Jordan.

oo FELL said he is not aware of any violent nature of
STRHAN, but did say that he seemed to have a "normal Arab
temper”.

He concluded the interview by saying that PEVEC would
have possibly much more current information concerning STRHAN.

at the Market Basket grocery store, 2270 North Lake Street,
Altadena, California. LIEN stated he had been acquainted
with SIRHAN SIRHAN since shortly after he arrived in this
country in 1957 or 1958. He stated he was much more closely
acquainted with MUNIR SIRHAN, who was his age. He stated
the SIRHANs lived about eight houses away from him at this
time He stated he knev: SIRHAN when he was in Junior High
School and in High School, but stated it was a typical
school relationship and not very close. He said he had no
social relationship with SIRHAN outside of school, and because
of their age, never discussed political ideas or social
philosophies. He.stated he last saw SIRHAN walking up the
street about two weeks prior to the KENNEDY shooting, but
merely waved at him. He described SIRHAN as a very quiet
person, who was usually at home, studying or reading. He did
not appear to have many close friends, and LIEN could not

LIEN volunteered that when he had read in the
newspapers that SIRHAN was married in his early teens, he
thought ne recalled MUNIR having said SIRHAN was married while
still in Jordan, and had left his wife there. LIEN stated he was
not positive of this, but believed he recalled it as it seemed
so strange to him that anyone would be married at the age of
twelve or thirteen. He stated he was also sure he had never
heard of SIRHAN or any of the SIRHAN children leaving the

MUSTAFA ALI SANKARI who resides at 942 North Los

Robles, Pasadena, telephone number 797-8093, was interviewed at

his place of employment at Burroughs Corporation, 460 Sierra

Madre Villa, Pasadena. SANKARI advised that he was born on

in Tripoli, Lebanon. He entered the United Pil

ates at New York on September 2, 1963 and he has not yet become
a citizen of the United States. He is described as white male,
5'5", 170 pounds, black hair, brown eyes, small scar on left

forehead. On October 7, 1966, he married FAYE WESTBROOK at
Pasadena, California.

SANKARI advised that he attended Pasadena City College
beginning in September, 1963 and went for five consecutive
semesters, ending with the semester of 1965 - 1966. He stated that
he first met SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in the first semester of 1963,
and that he had not known him prior to coming to this country and
attended Pasadena City College. He stated that he first met
SIRHAN because he associated with several Arab students at
Pasadena City College inasmuch as he did not speak very much
English. He stated that, therefore, SIRHAN was one of the several
with whom he associated, due to the language problem that he
faced.

He said that at no time did he have any close personal
association with SIRHAN and that he considered him just a school
acquaintance. However, he advised that he did go to the SIRHAN
home one time and met SIRHAN's mother and sister. This was just
prior to the time that the sister died. He said that after the
first semester of 1963 he did not see very much of SIRHAN, even
at school, because SIRHAN seemed to avoid the other Arab students
who did not speak English as well as he did. He stated that in his
opinion SIRHAN was a very quiet, shy individual who seemed very
withdrawn and reserved around others. He stated that he never saw
SIRHAN lose his temper and would never have thought him to be an
individual of a violent nature. He stated further that after the
first semester when he associated with SIRHAN at school, usually at
lunch time or over a cup of coffee, that he saw him only to
greet him as they passed on the campus. He further added that they

never discussed any type of politics or ideologies and that inas-
much as he, SANKARI, wanted to improve his English, he avoided
discussion of any type with the other Arab students inasmuch as
they almost always spoke to him in Arabic, and he wanted to speak
English.

He stated that since he left school in 1966 he has
seen SIRHAN only one time and that was approximately nine or ten
months ago when he saw him on the street in Pasadena and introduced
him to his wife. He further stated that other than SIRHAN's
mother and sister the only other member of the family he
had met was the brother, SHARIF, whom he met at Bob's Drive-in
Restaurant in Pasadena on one occasion.

REDBURN and furnished the following information:

SIRHAN SIRHAN hung out in Shap's Bar, 2565 East
Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena, California. Shap's reportedly
is a bar where one can place a bet on horse races and due to
the fear of having the hand book operation discovered, everyone
at Shap's is afraid to talk to law enforcement officers. SELFE

years old, 5'8", 170 pounds, dark hair, medium complexion,

in Pasadena, and drives a white Chevrolet sedan, license QAU 483.

SELFE stated that BETLICKE loaned $75 to one of
SIRHAN's Jordanian friends and that the Jordanian will not or
cannot repay the loan. BEILICKE approached the Jordanian with
the $75 and the Jordanian told him to leave him alone and
threatened him with a knife. For this reason, BEILICKE is
frightened and reluctant to talk about his relationship with
SIRHAN's friends.

BEILICKE told SELFE that SIRHAN has five close
friends he drinks with in Shap's Bar. He described them as
two Jordanians, one Cuban, and two Americans. SELFE was unable
to learn the names of these friends, but is certain BEILICKE
knows them all.

On June 10, 1968, Mrs. ALICE MOTHERSHEAD, Director,
Community Liaison Center, Pasadena City College, Pasadena,
Califovnia, advised she was in charge of the activities of
the International Club on the campus. She stated her department
was @ volunteer service, and she was not a part of the faculty.
She stated that to her knowledge, there was no Organization of
Arab Students, o: any clubs yecognized on the campus which
wee comprised of foreign students of one nationality. She
stated she had checked he. records, and had no récord of SIRHAN
SIRHAN belonging to the International Club, and had no -
knowledge concerning him. She stated he would not have been
included in a Foreign Students Registiy, since h® was an
immigrant to the United States, and was not here on a foreign
student's visa. Mrs. MOTHERSHESD had no record of a student
by the name of MUSTSFA SERMAIN (phonetic), being’
affiliated with the International Club. She did recall
ABDUL DABBAS, and first came in contact with him in 1656,
when he was present at Pasadena City College cn an immigrant
visa. She stated she had iented him a room or space in her
house fos a brief perlod; however, he was older and an
independent man, and preferred to rent a room by himself, so
left after staying at her address very briefly. He gave the
address of 1611 South Fourth Avenue, Arcadia, as that of
friends, and at another location in her records. She stated he had
a sponsor residing in Arcadia, so it was the assumption of
Mrs. MOTHERSHEAD that the people at this address might have
been his sponsors when he entered the United States. The last
record Mrs.MOTHERSHEAD had of DABBSS was that she had talked
to him briefly 1n 1962, and she had no knowledge of his
present whereabouts.

Mrs. MARGARET POMEROY, 26328 Monte Vista, Lomita,
California, telephone number 326-8044, advised that she was well
acquainted with ABDUIMAJID DABBAS, giso known as Abdul Dabbas.
POMEROY said she has known DABBAS for a period of eight to
ten years and for a period of about one year in 1966 and 1967
he rented a cottage from her located at the rear of 460
East Sacramento Street, Altadena, California. She said that
during that period she resided at the main residence at
460 East Sacramento Street, which is her property.

Mrs, POMEROY said that DABBAS returned to his
native country, Jordan about one year ago and she corresponded
with him for a period up until late 1967. She said the last
time she heard from DABBAS was during Christmas holidays in
1957 when she received a Christmas card from DABBAS postmarked
Jordan with no return address.

She said that DABBAS mentioned in the Christmas
card that he was returning to the United States sometime
during the summer of 1968 and, she said that if DABBAS arrived
in the United States, she would be in touch with him.

POMEROY stated that she previously wrote to
DABBAS at a Post Office box in Amman, Jordan, but she would
not disclose this post office box number inasmuch as it was
assigned to a friend of DABBAS' and DABBAS was no longer
using this post office box.

POMEROY said that she did not know, nor had she
ever met, SIRHAN SIRHAN and stated that she was introduced to
SIRHAN's mother, sister, and possibly two brothers about eight
years ago by DABBAS. POMEROY said it was possibly that
someone once had introduced her to the SIRHAN family but
