Mr. GARDNER advised that he had moved the guards
from place to place during the evening at the request of
the Fire Department and some of the KENNEDY aides.

He advised that Senator KENNEDY had been a guest
at the hotel on previous occasions during the present
campaign and that during his previous visits to the hotel,
it was made clear to htm, GARDNER, that the Senator did not
want any uniformed security guards in his presence nor did
he want any armed individuals as guards.

questioned, he was not cooperative. He refused to even divulge

of the questions asked of him was, "Are you ashamed of your
name?" The suspect, SIRHAN, in answer to this question:
answered, "Hell no. I'm not ashamed of my name.”

that the suspect, SIRHAN, made no statements to officers either
at the scene of the shooting or after he was arrested.

RESULTS OF

The FBI Laboratory advised on June 6, 1968, that

adequate for purposes of determining whether SIRHAN wrote
any of the questioned handwriting on the submitted material.
The Laboratory further advised that if adequate known
handwriting samples can be obtained, a suitable comparison
can be conducted. The Laboratory examination is continuing.

Inspector JOHN POWERS, Detective Division,
Los Angeles Police Department, advised that the ballistics
examination regarding the slugs recovered at the shooting
at the Ambassador Hotel on the morning of June 5, 1968,
has not been completed. Examination to date indicates
that the murder weapon was approximately six inches
from Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY when discharged.

Regarding the two spent bullets found in the
vehicle registered to SIRHAN SIRHAN, one is not capable
of being examined as it is flattened out, appearing to
have hit a piece of metal or rock. The other one has
not been subjected to ballistics examination but from visual
observation indicates that it had been removed from its
casing without being fired.

Examination has indicated that one bullet
“located in Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was definitely
fired by the murder weapon,

The bullet taken from EDWIN STOLL was a half
slug which cannot be positively identified as coming
from the murder weapon although examination is continuing.
At the present time a ballistics expert will testify to
the fact that it is his professional opinion that this
bullet is a .22 caliber. No further determination could
be made.

The bullet causing the wound to Mrs. ELIZABETH EVANS
cannot be entered into evidence as continuity of the bullet
has been lost.

Inspector POWERS stated that the ballistics examination
has not yet been completed, however, it is anticipated the’
examination will be finished by June 9 or 10, at which time
it will be furnished to the Los Angeles Division.
