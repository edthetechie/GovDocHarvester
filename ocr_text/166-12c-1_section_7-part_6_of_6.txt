ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, according to records of the Immi-
gration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles, California, was born
(e) in Jerusalem, Palestine. His current address was Pil
given as ast Howard Street, Pasadena, California. Immigration
and Naturalization Service records show he entered this country on
January 12, 1957, with his father, Bishara Salameh Ghattas Sirhan, his
mother, Mary, four brothers and a sister who is now deceased. His
brothers, Adel, Munir, and Saidallah, are currently shown as residing
with their mother and Sirhan at 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, .
California. The fourth brother, Sharif, is a resident of Highland Park,
California. His father allegedly resides now in Jordan.

Our Los Angeles Office reports that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan
graduated from high school in Pasadena, California. He thereafter
attended Pasadena City College, a junior college, for approximately two
years, but did not graduate. He formerly worked as a race horse
exercise boy and during September, 1966, sustained a head injury after
falling from a horse. Interviews with his family indicate his behavior
has changed considerably since this injury. Records of the State of
California reveal he was awarded a settlement on March 27, 1968, in - .
the sum of $2,000. His brother, Adel, advised the assailant has been
unemployed for the past three months. When taken into custody he had
$409 in cash on his person.

During a search of his room in the Pasadena family home
numerous items, including notations advocating the overthrow of the
President of the United States and statements alluding to the necessity .
for assassinating Robert F. Kennedy, were found. According to United
States Attorney William Matthew Byrne, Jr., Central District of
California, who had been in contact with the office of the Los Angeles
County District Attorney, this material should not be disclosed publicly
prior to the trial nor should it be made available to unauthorized persons
since it could have a serious adverse effect upon successful prosecution
in either Federal or State court. One handwritten page bearing the date
May 18, 1968, 9:45 a, m., contains numerous notations among which
are ''My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of
an unshakeable obsession." 'RFK must die - RFK must be killed.
Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated. '' Another page contains the
handwritten statement that "The so-called President of the United States

of America will be advised of their punishments for their treasonable
crimes against the state. More over we believe that the glorious United
States of America will eventually be felled by a blow of an assassin's
bullet. " .

A third page contains the following statement. ‘Ambassador
Goldberg must die die die." Repeated numerous times on this same page
appears "Goldberg will be illiminated. "

Page four contains the statement "Kennedy must die - Kennedy 5
must fall, '' which is repeated numerous times.
-—Page five contains the statement that "RFK must be disposed
of like his brother was."

The statement "I advocate the overthrow of the current
President of the (obscene) United States of America. I have no absolute
plans yet - but soon will compose some" appears on page six.

Page seven contains the statement ''Well, my solution to this
type of Govt. today is to do away with its leaders and declare anarchy, _ ,
the best form of Govt. or no Govt."

On page eight appears the statement "I believe that I can effect
the death of Bert C, Altfillisch, '' who was the employer of Sirhan at the.
time he was thrown from a horse during September, 1966.

Also appearing was the notation "Robert F. Kennedy must be.
assassinated before 5 June 68.'

In addition, a source who has furnished reliable information
in the past and who is an active member of the Communist Party in
California advised that he received information from an associate of
Sirhan's to the effect he was extremely anti-Semitic in his views, was
in favor of the Vietcong and supported some Communist Party ideals.
Sirhan, according to this source, had been thoroughly briefed on
Communist Party. activities at the University of California at Los Angeles
within the last two weeks. Although it was reported to this source that
an attempt had been made to recruit Sirhan into the Communist Party,
Sirhan allegedly has not engaged in any Communist Party activities.

Investigation by the FBI is continuing in order to determine
the full facts surrounding this situation and in order to ascertain if
Sirhan acted alone.

Now sir we come to Ahmid Evans convicted of killing three polic
emen and a by standedi but aperson no matter how many people a
person kill he can only die once for thencrimes,so Mr Ray got life
for killing Rev King with chanches of a shorter sentexce or parole,
later, Sirhan,well ever?" is trying to get him off the hook,2ut now
Amid Evans must die and that is all there is to it jwhy,???

because he killed?? or because he killed white people ??.

letter of February 25, 1969, the following points not covered
in referenced memorandum of April 24, 1969, are set forth for
your information.

Copies of all reports of the Los Angeles Police
Department pertaining to the Walter Crowe aspect of instant
investigation have been furnished your office.

The individual named "Bill" referred to on page three
of referenced letter of February 25, 1969, is identical with a

There is no information presently available
jndicating that Walter Crowe ever traveled outside the
continental limits of the United States.

Investigation to date has not disclosed that a
communist conspiracy has existed in the relationship between
Sirhan Sirhan, Walter Crowe and the assassination of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Interviews of members of the
Communist Party (CP) Club to which Walter Crowe belonged

room without explanation. It was later determined that Good
had returned to his room sometime during the evening or
morning of June 5-6, 1968, but had departed early June 6,
1968, leaving a phone number at which he could be reached
during the day. Inquiry at San Jose State College on
June 6, 1968, indicated that Good was then enrolled in a
course which did not meet at regular times and did not

require the student to be on the campus at any particular
time,

Pertinent information concerning the travel of
Thomas Good to Havana, Cuba, in the Summer of 1968 is

Was “Truth Letter Unfair to the Kennedys?

In response to my article "The Shame of the Kennedy Clan" (TL, May lst) .
I have received a communication from a source evidently in close touch with
the Kennedy family which earnestly questions my conclusion that the Kennedys‘
total lack of reaction to the outrage of the Bichan. tial indicates that they
must be either fools, or cowards, or juat pl&inly ing@ifferent te the crinea
of Dallas and Lea Angeles.

My informant points out that there is a fourth possibility which I fai-
led to take into account, to wit that the Kennedys, well aware of the truo
facts, the background and the inspiration of the two murders, and determined
to bring the culprits to justice, are just biding their time for tactical rea~
sons and will strike back when the moment is ripe. In raising this point,
which I evidently did not overlook, but have had so far no reason to credit,
my informant strongly suggests that a surprise move by the Kennedys that will
throw the conspirators into a panic may be just around the corner.

I still can't bring myself to believe that the surviving members of the
Kennedy clan will have the guts to do something drastic to end the intolerable
status quo of total deception, but I!11 keep an open mind, for I'm rather Lit~
pressed by the communication I have received. If the Kennedys are really wor
king hard but clandestinely to expose the real assassine of the President and
the Senator and to avenge the two murders ~ hurrah and more power to then!

Qne Down, Two More to Ge

TRUTH LETTER today is able to reveal the name of one of three Southern
businessmen with EKK affiliationa whe conspired to arrange and pay for the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. He is, or rather was, Ieander R. Perez
Sr., multimillionaire, longtime boss of Plaquemines Parish and a kingpin of
jouislana politics. The ‘Judge," ag Perez was called by friend and foe, was
an out-and-out sggregationist and, though a registered Democrat, an ardent
supporter of former Governer George C. Wallace of Alabama. In the apring of
1967, Persz and two like-minded friends « one a fellow New Orleans basiness~
man, the other a Miseigaippian ~ got together te recruit a couple of professiou
nal thugs who would take care of Dr. King. For a handsome fee, the trio were
able to enlist the services of an experienced marksman who had already taken
part in the Dealey Plaza embush, in which President Kennedy was slain, and who
now Was uaing the cover name of “Erie Starvo Galt." This fellow was quite wil-
ting to commit a second murder, but he wasn’% going to take the rap it any
thing happened to go wrong. So it was decided to bring a decoy into the game
and that part oll to James Eerl Ray whose “sacape" from the Missouri State
Penitentiary was also arranged and paid for by Peres angie $wo accomplices.

--- Page 20 ---
In the preparatory stage of the crime, Ray also assumed the identity of "Eric ~

Starvo Galt," in order to shield his accomplice, the real killer and te throw .

off potential pursuers. In the end, however, Ray was doublecrossed by his alter
ego and forced to take the rap for a murder he did not commit (for the tull do~
talls of this fantastic imbroglio, see "The Jameg Earl Ray Hoax!)

Perez, perhaps not the mastermind but certainly the chief financier or
this operation, suddenly died on March 19, 1969, at his sumptuous 6state out~
. gide Hew Orleans, allegedly of a heart attack. As he was 77 years old, the pos~
aibllity that this was for once a genuine heart attack evidently exists On the
other hand, in view of the ever-lengthening chain of suspicious deaths that has
followed the three graat assassinationa, the possibility of foul play cannot
be ruled out either. Here is wishing more of the same for Perez! accomplices
in plotting the dastardly Dr. King murder!

Who Is James Hepburn? (ctd. from TL 14, p. 3)

Even ag I pondered the matter and contacted various potential sources
of information for further enlightenment, the mysterious James Hepburn quite
unexpectedly popped again into the picture. Indeed, on Oct. 20, 1968, Bild am
Sonntag published an article entitled "Why Does America's Jackie Marry the
Greek Bnassis?” which carried the by~lines of James Hepburn and Goesta Schilling.
The latter is a staff correspondent of the paper. The way the story was handled
made it clear that the bulk of the information contained in it came from Hep~
burn while Schilling had been instrumental in rewriting and editing it for the
purposes of the German paper. Significantly, at the end of the article, there
was this copyright notice: "Copyright Hild am Sonntag and Frontiers Publishing
Company, Geneva."

The article was curiously bitter about Jackie Kennedy. It seemed to rem
flect the feelings of a person who had once idolized this woman but in the end
had become thoreughly disillisioned with her. (Could "James Heburatreally be
William Manchester? I wondered for a fleeting moment). In any event, and unless
en extraordinary amount of fakery was involved in the case ~ a possibility never
to be excluded altogether in such matters - 1% wae evident that the writer hed
known Jackie and her surroundings well. He deseribed her as a spoiled, petulant
wonai without class or tact who treated her staff arrogantly.

. “When the Kennedys visited Paris," Hepburn wrote, "a high-ranking offi~
cial of the quai d'Orsay (French Foreign Office) remarked: *The President him
self has shown himself to be a great man but cne got the impression that he was
taking out his secretary for the Sirst time.'"

Again, on Nov. 9, 1968, Bild an Sonntag published this item:

"Jackie is selfish, tactless, uot really pretty, rather a bit vulger,
spurious, typically nouveau riche, anything but a First Lady. This devastating
portralt is paiated... by James Hepburn who is reputed to be an intimete’ friend
of the Kennedy family...

My curlosity about James Hepburn more and more aroused, I wrote on
Feb. 2,1969 a letter to Frontiera Publishing Go., Vaduz, Idechtenstein (the
imprint carried by the German edition of his book) to inquire where I might be
akie to obtain a copy of the original English version of "Farevel.l arerica.®
4. fow days later thie letter was returneé to me unopened with a postal.notice
indicating shat the addressee vas “unknown in Vaduz. Liechtenstein is a tiny
country with, many corporate offices registered there only for tax gurpescs,
none of which escapes the attention of local officials. If there was such a
thing as a Fronilers Publishing Co., Vaduz, Liechtenstein, ny letter surely


--- Page 21 ---
@ @

would have reached them., The fact that it did not proves that the outfit ig a
phony at least in so farfs it pretends to be a registered Idechtenstein corpow
ration.

On the same date I wrote to Vaduz, I also addressed to Herr von Wehren~
alp, head of the Diisseldorf publishing firm, a long letter in which I pointed
out that the information given about the author on the jacket of "Verschwirungt
was unusually scanty and seemed to be, moreover, deliberately misleading. In
what I muct.confess was at least in part a fishing expedition, I wrote: "accor.
ding to information I have received from various sources, there is no Janeg
Hepburn; rather, this is the cover name of a group. The Kennedys disclaim any
knowledge of such a person. There are indications that the book was really
written by a number of people affiliated with the French intelligence servico
(S.D.E.C.E.) which is known te be better informed about the Dallas murder than
anyone else...'

In conclusion I asked Herr von Wehrenalp to tell me specifically where
and on what date James Hepburn waa born; what his nationality and place of ree
sidence were and haw I could reach him. I also inquired about the way the Hep«
burn manuscript had reached the German publisher and whether there were any
previously published books by this author.

Judicial Farce on the Instalment Plan

S© Sirhan new has added another glamor name to his star-studded cast
of defense lawyers. His appeal from the death sentence is to be handled, it
seens, by Melvin Belli of “Dallas Justice™ fame. And what, if one may ask, is
Sirhan using for money to pay for the services of the great Belli? In contrast
to Jack Ruby, Beili’s last notorious client, Sirhan is a pauper pure and siuple
whe couldn't pay half an hourte worth of legal conaultation out of his om
pocket. Who, then, is paying the astronomical fees such "high-priced defendergn
(cf. TRUTH LETTER, No. 10, p. 5) ao Messrs. Grant Cooper, Russell Parsene,
Emile Zola Berman and now Melvin Belli aormally charge? .

The law rightly provides for free legal assistance to needy defen-
dents, but 1t does not give them the right to pick the cream of the prefession,
o> even a whole quartet of topflight attorne;2a at state expense. Nor is it
in the least believable that men like Eolli, Berman, Cooper and Parsons would
really volunteer their services, least of all. in a cuteand-dried murder cags
leaving no reom for a dramatic demonstration of innocence. american lawyers
arentt that unselfish (nor are thelr colleagues elsewhere). Obviously, then,
someone else is picking up the tab for Sirhan’s costly defense, which is al-~
ready running inte hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Who covld have an interest in putting up such a huge amount for
the defense of an assassin caught red-handed? Who can spend lavishly for any
purpose without ever having to account for expenditutes? Who but the Cla?

4s leng as there is no plausible explanation from any quarter as
regards the origin of the vast funds that have been available for Sirhan'a
defense, the suspicion ts warranted that all or most of it has come through
one or the other of the CIA's innumerable "conduits. Taking into account Sir~
hean's background as a CIA agent ~ already documented in TRUTH LETTER ~ and the
manifest reluctance of the news media even tc touch on thie matter, the suspi-
clon becomes a certainty.’

This Lasue of TRUTH LETTER comes to you from France where the CIA cannot in«
tercept meil or moniter telephone conversations ag effectively as it can in
Germeny.

excerpts of that letter:

"It ig nice to note that the massive amount of overkill directed atiiacre..
diting the District Attornsy of New Orleans which appeared in your editorial
‘verdict at New Orleange;! the editorial you reprinted from the Wali Street Zour.
nal,'Trial by Publicity, Indesd;! and similar editorials appearing in concert
across the country, with the same specious hunbug and asemingly ghoat-writton
by the seme hand, did ime not have the desired effect and has been ignored by
the American peaple.

"“Shis was made evident last week by a radio talk show. One women calling
was concerned that the truth about the essassination of Preaident Kennedy would
not be made kmown because of the acquittesl of Clay Shaw. Apparently the Warren
Commiesion conclusions were net considerad relovant. They were referred to once
ag being coupletely illogical, but the gist of the conversation was whether the
truth would be made known.

RYour statement that *it remains a fact that neither Mr. Garrison nor
anyone else has produced a shred of g0lid evidence to refute the conclusions
of the investigating committee headed by Chief Justice Warren,! indicates that
you have been misinformed. There is photographic evidence backing syewitness
testimony that shots were fired from the front as vell as the back. And this
was clearly brought out in evidence at the Shew conspiracy trial.

*The press didn't publish outside of New Orleens area any of the tegtiv
mony brought out in the cress examination of br. Shaw such as the fact that
he knew two of Bavid Ferrie'g roommates, one of whom was apparently using the
name of Leon Oswald. Nor was 1t published ovtside of New Orleans that the house
to which Mr. Spiegel led the judge and jrry in the French Quarter was one that
Mr. Shaw admitted had formerly belonged to him and was next door to an aimest
identical house which had also belonged to Mr. Shaw as late a9 1963 which is
wnen Mr. Splesel said the party he attended that was hosted by Mr. Shaw took
place. :

“When the trial was over and Mr. Shaw Nad been go Iuckily acquitted,
it was obviously decided to direct this massive smear attack on Mr. Garrison's
character in order to divert attention from the fact that the Warren Commission's
conclusions had been completely demolished.

tReadlines acress the country proclaimed, ‘american Bar to Seek Proba
of? Garrison! However, few of the televisien notworke or newapapets reported
the following retraction which appeared iv email type in the Times-Picayune,
‘The whole story is inaccurate,’ the American Sar Association president said,
Ho was aleo quoted as saying that Garriaon's witnesses ‘must have Deen pretty
good or the grand jury would not have indicted shaw!

"Jn the attempt to discredit this district atternuy who had the courage
aud integrity to fulfil the dutLes of kia office... many others were maligned
ineluding the three judgea who ruled that thers was causa to try Mr. Shay; the
jury of citizens whe also ruled there wag causa...the judge whom both the pro-
seoution and the defense said tried the case fairly and who twice ruled ‘that
the case should not he diemissed but should go to tha jury; and all of the
state's witnesses who testified against Mr. Shaw... and many othera whe ware
unfairly sncared in order to kesp afloat “he Warren Commission conclusions.

Z% seene to mo that this ig net acceptablic in tho United States.”

others relevant to the case will bo expleved in depth in 'Wighlights aad Lessons

PRILOGY OF MURDER

An Analysis and Interpretation of the John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kenne.~
dy and Dr. Martin lather King assassinations

by
JOACHIM JOESTEN

Author of more than 40 published books on current affairs, including
eight on the assassination of President Kennedy

In the past six years, America has witnessed threa political assassi~ —
nations of nationally and internationally prominent leadera ~ two of them
within a few months of each other. The victims ~ President John F. Kennedy,
Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King - all werefighting -
liberals, champions of civil rights and social justice and men of peace.

Did it ever occur to you that there might be a hidden link between
these three murders of so obviously kindred personalities? That there might
be a meaning and significance in their success%ve elimination from the po-
litical scene? That there could be a pattern of assassination that hag be-
come an integral part eof the political process in America?

No doubt these thoughts have occurred to you as to many other thought~
ful, discerning people with a sense of history. You have felt uneasy, beset
by doubts, deeply troubled. After a while, though, you have accepted, reluc=
tantly perhaps, but nevertheless, what the authorities and the presse kept
hammering into your head ~ that, there was "no evidence" of a conspiracy,
that these murders were the handiwork of unbalanced, fanatical assassins,
each operating entirely on his own = Lea H. Oswald, James Barl Ray, Sirhan
B. Sirhan. sooner cr later you were bound to succumb to the relentless
pressure of the best-organpzed and most efficiently executed brainwashing
operation in history. Conformism and consensus got the upper hand over
your critical faculties and historical training.

Well, start thinking again. Use your inalienable right as a free and
educated person to examine official pronouncements critically, to test what
you read in the papers by the standards of academic insight and experience,
to dismiss false pretenses and to search for the truth,

Politiclans, journalists and the general public ~ not only in america,
but on a world-wide acale -. have been duped en masse about the assassinations
by a machinery of deception unmatched in scope, power and resources.Histo~ .
riana and political scientists worth their salt will not be thus deluded!
They will want to view ovents in perspective, probe for the true facts, ex~
piore hidden meanings and draw their own conclusions. [f you are one of
them, you cannot afferd te miss thia shocking eye-opener: ”

in mimeographed form, Tue to various circumstaaces, publication of the three

pattern ~ and the common inspiration.

The firet volume published ia:

(I) The Greatest Police Fraud Rver
HE ZAMES EARL RAY HOAX

Published even before the farcical 2-hour~trial at which James Earl
Ray falgely pleaded guilty to the murder of Dr. King ~ he hae since retracted
this plea which had been forced upon him ~ Chis volume demonstrates in anple
detaii and on the strength of cogent ovidence aupprensed by the authorities
that Ray was not the killer of the femcus Nogre loader, but only a decoy used
by the real munderer, In the courss of a fautastie imbroglie - documented atop
by step in this report ~ Ray then wan framed by his accomplices and threwn to
the wolves, with the Fst colliously conniving for “reasons of atate™.

The Janea Earl Ray Hoax consists of three parts, the firet two of which
were pu ed in the spring of 1969; a third part, designed to bring the stou
ry up to date through the "triel? in Momphie and Ray's plea for a new trial,
is due to be published in the summer of 1969.

(II) Ceming in the summer of 1969
HIGHLIGHTS AND LESHONS OF TEE

CLAY SHAW FRLAL

Contrary to the deliberately falas impression created by the news media,
and in spite of the defendant's acquittal, the trial of Clay Shew in New Ore
loans in no way vindicated the Warren Neport - far from it! Ae a matter of
fact, the evidence presented at this trial has conclusively demenatrated the
reality of a massive conspiracy which ied te the creasfire ambuch of President
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, evon though District attorney Jim Garrison
failed in his attempt te connect Glay Shaw with it.

In this volum, the author painstakingly examines the complete trans-
eript of the proceedings (of which only seme fragmenta have been published ae
far in the daily and pericdical pross ond these only in the most ene=-sided and
blassed manner peasible) and dravea thoroughly substantiated conclusions.

Alcohol’s Effect

Los Angeles

In a jail cell experiment
in drunkenness, Sirhan
Sirhan went berserk and
became like “a wild
beast,’ a defense psychia-
trist testified yesterday at
Sirhan’s murder trial. .

«J think he thought he was
pack at the Ambassador
Rotel, Dr. Eric Marcus told a
jury trying the 25-year-old
Jordanian for his life.

It was in the Ambassador
that Sirhan fatally shot Sena-
tor Robert F. Kennedy last
year. The defendant has said
he was drunk at the time and
igs unable to recall the killing.

COCKTAIL

Marcus said that in the test
Sirhan was given six ounces
of alcohol in a Tom Collins
cocktail.

“Psychologically he went |

berserk... .,” the psychia-
trist said. “He was extreme-
ly agitated and restless and

cursing and had to be physi-
cally restrained.

“He kept grabbing at his
throat. He said ‘What the hell
is going on here?’ He thought
he was choking. He said, ‘I'll
get.even with those Jews.’

ENOUGH

“T think he thought he was
back at the Abassador Hotel.
Then he started talking about
how 20 years were enough

.|for. the Jews, and Kennedy

didn’t have to help them... .

“He never said he killed
Kennedy. He kept talking as
though Kennedy were alive.
He said, ‘That bastard isn’t
worth the bullet.’ With all my
prodding he never said he

‘| killed Kennedy.

“The alcohol triggered off
some sort of an irritation. He
became sort of like a wild
beast.”

3ppafer
on

Sirhan ¢

It was pointed out to Mar-
cus on state cross examina-
tion'that, aside from Sirhan’s
own statement that he was
drunk, there was no testimo-
ny during the trial that he
actually was intoxicated.

“Idon’t assume he was in-
toxicated at the time he com-
mitted the offense,’ Marcus
replied. “I assume he had
some drinks. J also assume
the shock of his apprenhen-
ion had a sobering-up effect.

“It is my assumption that
with a lot of alcohol he does
the same sort of thing,only
more so, that he does with
a little alcohol.”

Under cross examination
earlier, Marcus conceded it
was ‘‘quite possible” Sirhan
was lying when he claimed
he could not remember the
June 5, 1968, shooting.
