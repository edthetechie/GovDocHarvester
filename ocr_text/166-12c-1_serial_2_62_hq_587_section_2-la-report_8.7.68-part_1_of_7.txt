located on the same room as the Embassy Room, From the
kitchen, he got into the Embassy Room dressed in the
cook's uniform, After he got into the Embassy Room, he
took off the cook's uniform and placed it under one of
the telephones in the room,

Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, he had
a position on the right side of the platform from
which Senator KENNEDY was making a speech. He took this
position on the right side of the platform because he noticed
that women dressed in KENNEDY girl outfits had formed an
aisle for the Senator to depart from the room,

When the Senator completed his speech he did
not come through the aisle formed by the girls but turned
and walked off the back of the stage and out through the
rear door.

KADAR jumped up on the stage and followed Senator
KENNEDY out the rear door,

KADAR estimated that he was about 7 to 10 feet
behind Senator KENNEDY when the Senator entered the
pantry area.

As he, KADAR, entered the pantry area, he heard
what he thought was a string of firecrackers being exploded.
At the time he thought there were approximately five rapid
explosions, ‘

Almost immediately he noticed a man lying on the
floor and observed that the man had been wounded, At the
same time, he also noticed that Senator KENNEDY was lying
on the floor. He rushed past the first man, who was lying
on the floor and bent over Senator KENNEDY. At that time,
he observed that Senator KENNEDY was supporting himself
on his elbows,

He looked up from Senator KENNEDY and observed

two or three individuals who were struggling with a man

holding a gun; He later determined that two of

the individuals, who were holding this man, were ROOSEVELT

GRIER and RAFER JOHNSON. He does not know the identity

of the third man. They were holding the individual with
the gun on top of a metal table,

held the man's hand and slammed it against the table
Several times without success. While he was attempting
to take the gun from the man's hand, someone else pried
it Loose,

firing shots from the gun. He only observed the man holding
the gun after the shots were fired.

ARTHUR KEVIN, also known as Art Kevin, KHJ-TV
Channel 9, 5515 Melrose Avenue, phone HO 202133, advised as
follows:

He was at the Ambassador Hotel June 4 and 5, 1968
doing live radio proadcasting to New York for his station, KHJ,
which he described as being an independent network. He
had two microphones set up in the Embassy Room, one on the
platform and the other in the back of the room. After Senator
KENNEDY gave his speech to those assembled in the Embassy Room
around midnight he switched the broadcast to his microphone
in the rear of the ballroom and began recapping the speech to the
listening audience from notes that he had taken. Just a minute
or two after he got into his recap he heard several sounds
like balloons popping. He heard several such reports but he
does not recall how many. He then switched his program to the
news election service at the Bilhore Hotel so that he could find
out what had happened since he also heard shouts in the area that
Senator KENNEDY had been shot.

He tried to get closer to the scene of the action
but he could not because of the large number of people
assembled in the ballroom. The police arrived very quickly on
the scene and he estimated that within six or seven minutes from
the time he heard the shots the police had the area blocked off
in a commendable fashion.

He did not see SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN at any time during
the period preceding the shooting nor does he recall seeing a
female Caucasian in a polka dot dress at any time during the
evening.

He advised that he has tapes of what occurred in the
ballroom following Senator KENNEDY's speech but he does not at this
time consider anything of pertinent value since he was removed
somewhat from the actual incident.

KOKOJAN said after Senator KENNEDY finished his
speech, he suddenly made his exit from the room through a
rear entrance whichws somewhat of a surprise to the
filming crew who expected Senator KENNEDY to turn to his
left from the stand and make his exit from the room
through the main entrance door. KOKOJAN presumed Senator
‘KENNEDY made his exit from the. room in a different manner
because of the huge crowd in the room which would have
delayed his exit 15 or 20 minutes before he could reach’
the main door. He said he knew Senator KENNEDY was hurry=-
.ing toe another room for a press conference and presumed ©
a last minute change had been made to expedite his depar=
ture.

: KOKOJAN said at the time Senator KENNEDY was shot
he was busy with his camera duties on the stand in the
Embassy. Room and he was not an eye witness to the shooting.
He said he first became aware of some ‘confusion at one of the
rear doors to the room when he heard persons near the door
screaming and crying. KOKOJAN said because the crew had
finished shooting films of Senator KENNEDY‘s speech, no fur=
ther filming activities were carried on by the crew after
_ the shooting occurred. He said he does not have any photo=
graphs. which were taken during or after the shooting occurred.
He said he has never known nor has he ever seen SIRHAN SIRHAN
at any time. He said ‘he did not know who initiated the
change in Senator KENNEDY's route for leaving the Embassy
Room and he presumed this was a last minute change because

of the tremendous crowd in the room.

JESSE UNRUH of Washington, D. C. got on a table and

tried to get the crowd away from the suspect. UNRUH said,
"We want this one alive."

About fifteen minutes before the shooting,
LITTLEWOOD had walked through the kitchen area to the
Imbassy Ballroom, He could not recall ever having seen
the suspect,S2REAN SIRHAN before, Also, he could not
recall having seen a young lady wearing a polka dot dress
in the kitchen corridor of the hotel, LITYLEWOOD said he
did not hear anyone call out, "We've shot him."

LITTLEWOOD did not know vhat route KENEEDY would
use to go from the Embassy Room to the Colonial Room but
thought he probably would walk through the crowd of supporters
as it was his custom to walk through groups of well wishers.

The reporters had been told to use the kitchen area as a

corridor since the hotel was crowded, LITTLEWOOD described
the people in the Embassy Room as an orderly one prior to
the shooting. Tt was air conditioned but the television
lights made it seem very warm, LITTLEWOOD did not know
what KENNEDY planned to do after talking with the press

in Colonial Room,

A lot of non press peophe came to the Golonial
Room during the evening because of the television set there.
Several times an effort was made to have a guard at the
door to keep out people who did not have press credentials
but this was difficult to do and persons could enter the
coom from the kitchen corridor also. Complaints were made
about the number of the people in the room who were not
with the press, These complaints were made to HUGH MAC DONALD,

JAMES LOWE, 4620 Coliseum, Los Ang?’ es; calitornia,
advised he recalled having told some young KENNEDY workers just
before the end of Senator KENNEDY's speech at the Embassy Room
that there had been a change in plans, that instead of exiting
from the stage at the right, as one looks at the stage, from
which point Senator KENNEDY and his party had entered, the new
plans were that he was to exit from the left rear and go to the
Colonial Room for a press conference. He said he had been told
this by a well-dressed man from New York, whom he understood
to be from New York, :

Mr. LOWE stated he had furnished detailed information
concerning this portion of the inquiry when previously interviewed
by SA BAILEY of the Los Angeles Office.

He also stated he wanted to furnish the following
additional information:

On June 14, 1968, he was talking with THAD HEATH,
another member of the KENNEDY party, who was on stage at the
time Senator KENNEDY spoke at the Embassy Room. He was also
with the Senator when he was shot and held the people back.
HEATH told IOWE he felt certain he had seen SIRHAN sitting on
stage the night Senator KENNEDY gave a speech at Temple
Isaiah, 10345 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, about three
weeks ago. HEATH said this man was just sitting on stage,
looking out into the audience.

LOWE, who was also present at Temple Isaiah on the
night in question, said he does not remember seetihg anyone
resembling STRHAN,.

In LOWE's presence, LENA SMITH telephoned KAREN GANLEY

another young professional KENNEDY worker. LENA
SMITH mentioned to KAREN GANLEY that someone closely resembling
SIRHAN had been seen onstage at Temple Isaiah, and discussed
with GANLEY the fact that someone with a similar name had been
calling her for dates. GANLEY said she did not believe the man
onstage, who may have had some resemblance to SIRHAN, was
identical with SIRHAN. She said she had also been called by
someone with a name SHAN, SHAWN, or something similar, asking
for a date, but had turned him down. :

LOWE asked LENA SMITH where this man might have
gotten her telephone number, and she suggested the possibility
he may have gotten it from KENNEDY neadquarters, 5615 Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles.

LOWE then talked with LINDA SUCKNEY, secretary at
KENNEDY neadquarters. She recalled talking with a young man
who volunteered his services as a KENNEDY worker and filled
out an application. She believed he had a first name resembling
JAMESTED, and remarked that he was an exchange student from
one of the Arab countries. She recalled that he had asked for,
and been given, the telephone numbers of LENA SMITH and KAREN
GANLEY.

LOWE said he is chairman of the Membership Committee
of the local KENNEDY organization. BILL EVANSON is co-chairman,
and currently has all the application forms of volunteer workers
at his home. LOWE estimated there are about 600 such forms, and
said EVANSON would be glad to furnish them for review.

My. RICHARD G. LUBIC, 2010 Hillcrest Drive, Hollywood,
California, advised as follows:

He currently is president of the Color Corporation of
America, 9000 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, a closed-
circuit television company. He attended the victory celebration
for Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY held at the Ambassador Hotel, Los
Angeles, on the evening of June 4, 1958, as the guest of RICHARD A.
KLEIN, Public Relations Director, Southern California KENNEDY
Campaign Headquarters. LUBIC formerly was associated with "Time"
magazine and television station KHJ, Los Angeles, Channel 9. He
has traveled with Senator KENNEDY and is well known to KENNEDY and
the people associated with the KENNEDY election campaign.

LUBIC wanted to congratulate Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
upon his election victory in California and stood close to the
speaker's rostrum to await the opportunity. LUBIC noted KENNEDY
had arrived at the speaker's rostrum via a door behind the rostrum
and anticipated that he might exit through this door. A minute
or less prior to the termination of the speech, LUBIC checked to
determine if this area might be appropriate to attempt to speak
to KENNEDY. LUBIC noted that access to the corridor behind the
rostrum could be reached through two doors. He also made casual
observation of the corridor area beyond the doors and has a
recollection of seeing a woman dressed in white in the corridor.
LUBIC assumed the woman was a hotel employee probably assigned
to the kitchen. He has no recollection of observing anyone else
in the corridor. .

After making this brief check, LUBIC returned to the
front of the speaker's rostrum just as KENNEDY completed his talk.
LUBIC then followed KENNEDY as he left the rostrum. LUBIC noted
KENNEDY was going to exit the room via the corridor behind the
rostrum as anticipated. He also noted KENNEDY was headed for the
far door to the corridor. LUBIC entered the corridor via the
closer door and was at KENNEDY's right shoulder as he walked down
the corridor.

LUBIC thought KENNEDY saw him and recognized him, and
LUBIC continued walking with KENNEDY waiting for him to stop
shaking hands with people and to acknowledge him. LUBIC heard
an unidentified voice saying, "KENNEDY, you son of a bitch,” and
then heard two shots which sounded like shots from a starter
pistol at a track meet. LUBIC did not identify the source of
the voice and did not immediately determine the source of the
shots. He quickly noted, however, an individual with a gun.
This individual was located on the left side of the corridor
and had his right knee on a small table or air conditioning unit
and had raised himself up on this knee to obtain elevation while
shooting.

LUBIC has no recollection of hearing the sounds of
additional shots, but recalls seeing the gun and the arm of the
assailant and noted the jerk of the gun and the arm, apparently
caused by the recoil action of the gun. LUBIC noted KENNEDY
had fallen and was bleeding from the back of his head. LUBIC
sougnt cover behind an ice machine or table in the corridor under
the assumption the shooting would continue. Prior to seeking
cover, LUBIC had observed the expression in KENNEDY's eyes and
assumed he was mortally wounded.

LUBIC then noted that one or more of the hotel employees
and other people were struggling with the assailant in an attempt
to disarm him and to subdue him. LUBIC got up and linked arms
with two hotel security employees to keep the crowd in the kitchen
area from coming into the corridor. During this period, the .-
assailant was still being subdued and disarmed. LUBIC remained
in this area until police took custody of the assailant and
removed him from the hotel.

The following day, LUBIC recognized news media photographs
of SIRHAN B. SIRHAN as being identical with the assailant.

and the station went back on the air. MARSHALL continued
broadcasting his observations of the activity taking place
at the hotel.

MARSHALL did not observe the shooting and he did
not see SIRHAN. MARSHALL said that at about the time of the
shooting, he was located about 25 feet away from the terrace
door of the Embassy Room. He said he subsequently learned
a witness had alleged that a girl in a polka dot dress saying,
"We've shot him, we've shot him" had exited from this door.
MARSHALL said he had searched his memory and had no recollec-
tion of seeing this girl. He said he was mentioning this for
what ever value it might have. He noted that he was con-
centrating on his announcing and did not observe every
person using this door.

Rockwell, Inglewood, California, telephone OR 0-8151, advised
that he had been a member of the Comptonfor KENNEDY Committee.
Since he was on this committee he decided to go to the Ambassador
Hotel on June 4, 1968 for KENNEDY's victory speech. MENEFIELD
parked about one block north of the Ambassador in a service
station driveway. He was alone and arrived at the Ambassador
Hotel at 10:45 p.m. After he had entered the Ambagsador
dor Hotel he went to the room where KENNEDY was supposed to speak,
by way of the kitchen. MENEFIELD saw nothing while entering the
hotel. ;

MENEFIELD believes that he was in the Embassy Room
and after he had been there for a short while Senator KENNEDY
came and spoke. The Senator then turned and went out a back
door and in a few minutes MENEFTIELD heard some noise in the
kitchen. He then heard screaming. He started towards the
double door that leads into the kitchen to investigate the noise
and a woman came out of the door with blood on her head and
said, “They shot him’.

MENEFIELD walked back to the kitchen, looked through
a crowd of people and saw the back of Senator KENNEDY's head.
He realized at that time that it was the Senator who had been
shot. He saw another man, wha had apparently been shot, sitting
ina chair. MENEFIELD was very upset and had not fully under-
stood the whole situation so he then walked back to the auditorium.
He stated he stayed at the hotel until around 3:00 a.m. when he
called his wife.

Nothing unusual was noticed by MENEFIELD and he had
heard nothing about any type of violence.

After viewing a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN he advised
that he had never seen him before.

post at the entrance to the ballroom and went inside. In the
kitchen he saw Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor with a hotel
employee and Mrs. KENNEDY, the Senator's wife, crouched near
him. He noticed another man standing up holding his stomach.
He also saw CARL (last nane unknown) , a hotel employee, trying
to wrest a pistol from the hand of an individual whose name he
now knows to be SIRHAN SIRHAN. There was a great deal of con-
fusion and people were shouting, "Get the gun! Get the guni".
In the confusion he noticed, among others, two men and a woman
leaving the kitchen through a back exit. He could not see
the woman's face but believed that she was approximately 5'5"
tall, with light colored hair, and wearing a polka dot dress.
One of the men was about 6'2"’tall with dark hair and wearing
a dark suit. The other man was approximately 5'5" or 5'6"
tall and also wearing a suit. He could not describe these
individuals in any greater detail and does not believe that
he could identify them if he saw them again. Other people
also left.

He remained in the kitchen for approximately ten
minutes before he went back to his post at the doorway of
the Ambassador Ballroom. He had no further information
concerning this incident.

SANDRA METTETAL, Reporter, City News Service, 417 South
Hill, Los Angeles, California, Room 460, phone 625-7601, advised
as follows:

On June 4, 1968, she was assigned to cover Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY at the Ambassador Hotel. At approximately
10:30 P.M. she went to the Embassy Room and sat on the platform to
insure that she would be close to Senator KENNEDY when he addressed
the rally. At approximately 11:00 P.M. she went out the main door
of the Embassy Room to get a drink and visit the restroom. When
she was returning she was told by a guard that she could not
enter the Embassy Room through that door but had to proceed
through the Colonial Room. She did this and then proceeded through
the kitchen area on her way to the Embassy Room and in passing
through this area she observed between five and ten individuals
there. Since she was not looking for anyone she did not pay too
much attention to these individuals but she had the impression
that they were all employees of the hotel. She does not recall
seeing SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN there or a female Caucasian wearing a

- polka dot dress.

In order to gain access to the platform she had to.
enter a closed door, which was opened for her by one member of a
small singing group, which frequently leads Senator KENNEDY's
rallies in singing the song"This Man is My Man". ‘This group
comprised one male Negro, “two Caucasian males and one Caucasian
female, and the males were dressed in orange trousers and white
sweaters. She stated that the area behind the curtains, on the
platform,was a semi-room with a plano. ‘The singing group
was practicing here. -—- - Le . :

She waited on the platform and assisted an unknown male
Caucasian with dark hair in his early 20's, who she stated is
employed by Continental Recordings. She helped him set up his
microphones as well as another individual by the name of STEVE BELL,
who she stated is an ABC radio reporter.

When Senator KENNEDY made his speech she was on
the platform to Senator KENNEDY's left. When he finished his
speech she rushed to the phones to call her office. As she
was doing this she observed Senator KENNEDY leave the platform
through some curtains which were on the rear of the platform.
A few minutes later while still on the phone she first learned
that something was wrong when a woman screamed "Oh my God". She
then heard others in the general area state that Senator KENNEDY
had been shot and this was followed by other screams and shouts.

She advised that she could not get closer to the scene

of the shooting in the kitchen area due to the large crowd, and
she can furnish no further information regarding the shooting.

SANDRA METTETAL, Reporter, City Newspaper Service,
417 South Hill Street, Los Angeles, advised the following by
phone on July 3, 1968:

With respect to details on a group of singers, who
SANDRA had observed in the Embassy Room during the Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY campaign party, SANDRA described them as
being in their late teens or early 20's. The group, consisting ©
of one female and two white male Caucasians and one male
Negro, had approached SANDRA, who was standing on the podium
in the Embassy Room where Senator KENNEDY was to speak.
The group did not appear to have a name but asked SANDRA
if it would be okay to get upon the podium and sing. SANDRA
said she would not have the authority to authorize the request
and referred them to someone on the KENNEDY staff nearby.
These singers were dressed in white sweaters and orange
trousers. When last observed the group was talking to KAREN
KLINE of the KENNEDY campaign staff. KLINE is currently
working at the former Senator KENNEDY Campaign Headquarters at
5616 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles. The work is presently
devoted to gun control.

SANDRA continued that she had no information as to
the identity to the group of singers or where they may be
located. Further, she did not know whether they would be
potential witnesses orrmt.

A person observed on the podium during the
KENNEDY campaign party in the Embassy Room was a male
Caucasian in his early 20's, who was employed by Continental
Recordings. He had recording equipment and was believed to have
a press pass. His name is not known to SANDRA but he had
been observed driving a large white automobile with large blue
lettering "Continental Recordings."
