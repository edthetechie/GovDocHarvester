She made available an application for license
as a hot walker completed by SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. The
license was issued on January 1, 1966, at the Santa Anita,
California Race Track.

The application indicated that SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, California, was
born on in Jerusalem, Jordan. His employer Pll
was listed as GORDON BOWSHER. A previous employer of
SIRHAN was listed as CLARENCE COPPING, 2529 Foothill,

as persons who have known SIRHAN well for the past ten years.
These individuals were furnished as: WALTER CROWE, 1700
Topeka Street, Pasadena, California; TOM GOOD, 1743
Elizabeth Street, Pasadena, California; JOHN STRATHMANN,
1760 North Oxford Avenue, Pasadena, California. The form

that she recalled SIRHAN SIRHAN coming-into the office in
the fall of 1966,.after.he-had. been thrown from of a horse,
She advised that he was a very nervous and "sumpy" person,
and she talked to him on a few occasions attempting to get
him to settle down in the office and not to be so upset
while awaiting the Doctor. She said that from the slight
conversation she had with him, he appeared to be an unhappy
and nervous person who gave the impression he felt like he
was being picked on most of the time. She said that he
appeared to be very self-conscious about his very small
size. She had no discussions with him of a political
or social nature, and talked with him in an attempt ‘to calm

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date 0/8/68

Dr. RICHARD A. NELSON, Suite 7, 750 South Washburn,
Corona, California, advised that he recalled treating SIRHAN
SIRHAN for an injury received from a fall. SIRHAN SIRHAN was
thrown from a horse while he was employed by the Granja Vista
Del Rio Farms. He was first seen on September 25, 1966, when
he was brought to the Corona Community Hospital. Dr. NELSON
said that there was no serious injury incurred. He was admitted
to the hospital by Dr. NELSON on September 25, 1966, at
12:30 p.m. He was released at 1:35 p.m. on September 26, 1965.
Dr. NELSON wanted him to stay in the hospital longer, but he was
very reluctant to stay in the hospital and almost a belligerent
patient. X-rays were taken of his skull, back, shoulders, and
arms, and they were all negative. There was no permanent camage
incurred in any place from this fall. SIRHAN was scratched
extensively and the injury was painful for a few days, but was
not serious.’

.Br. NELSON recalled: ' SIRHAN questioned all of the
medical applications and all medicines administered to him, and
appeared unduly frightened of the various treatments. Dr. NELSON
said that he appeared to be an angry young person, but that he
diag not give it much thought at that time. He said that he does
remember him very plainly, because he was one of the most reluctant
patients that he had ever had.

Dr. NELSON furnished the copies of all the medical
records at the Corona Community Hospital, and furnished these
to SA BLANTON.

After SIRHAN was released on September 26, 1966,
Dr. NELSON saw him again on September 29, 1966. Notations
were made in his own records that he was healing, and he was
fully active at that time. He saw him again on October 26, 1956,
in his office, and SIRHAN appeared to be completely healed. He
complained of a little trouble with his left eye, and Dr. NELSON
referred him to Dr. MILTON A. MILLER, 824 South Main, Corona,
an optometrist.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF ‘INVESTIGATION

1 Date 6/8/68

. MILTON A. MILLER, Medical Doctor, Optometrist,
824 South Main, Corona, California, advised that SIRHAN SIRHAN
‘had. been first seén at his office on November 8, 1966, for
an eye injury and gave the history of being thrown from a
horse while working as an exercise boy.

SIRHAN gave the history of being thrown from a
horse while working at one of the local farms. He was
referred to Doctor MILLER by a General Practitioner, Doctor
RICHARD A. NELSON. He examined the eye of SIRHAN and noted
in his records that SIRHAN seemed to exaggerate his injuries, |
that’: 20-20 vision was found in both eyes and that there
was a small view of vision in the left eye that might have
been restricted in a slight way. He saw him again on
November 14, 1966, November 22, 1966, and December 20, 1966.
Doctor MILLER noted in his records on December 20, 1966, that
he believes that SIRHAN was a malingerer. When he last
saw SIRHAN on December 20, 1966, SIRHAN told him he was
no longer employed in this area and was living in Pasadena.
Doctor MILLER referred him to a Doctor KOEHN in Pasadena
and stated that he was glad that he was no longer in this area
He said he told SIRHAN that he could not write a letter to
his insurance company, stating that his injury was not-of a
nature wherein he should collect compensation. He advised
that SIRHAN appeared very angry and nervous, but that he had
no discussions with him and recalled no conversations in the
office with SIRHAN. He does recall that after he had seen him
on the last occasion, December 20, 1966, at approximately two
hours later, he received a telephone call from SIRHAN. SIRHAN
told him something to the effect that if he did not do what
he wanted him to, he would "get him". SIRHAN did not say how
he would get him and did not give Doctor MILLER time to answer him
but hung up the telephone. Doctor MILLER said he did not make
a report of this to the police department as he merely
passed it off as an angry young man and besides, he noted
that SIRHAN did not say how he would get him;

rE. GuRDON KIEEN, M.D., Eye Physician and surgeon,
Suite 203, ig North El Molino Avenue, Pasadena, was interviewed
concerning his knowledge of SIRHAN SIRHAN. KIEHN was advised
of the identity of the interviewing agent and he stated that
he had treated SIRHAN for a work related eye injury sustained
on or about September 24, 1966.

SIRHAN SIRHAN, 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena,
i telephone No. S¥ 8-2136, Social Security No.

noo neste to his office on February 21, 1967, having

een referred by Dr. MILTON A, MILLER of Ontario, California.
SIRHAN exercised horses at the Granja Vista Del Rio Ranch
(ALfillisch Construction Company), 13200 Citrus, Corona,
California, and on or about September 24, 1966, he was thrown
from his horse and suffered injuries around the left eye.
SIRHAN thought he was unconscious for a brief time and he was
treated at the Corona Community Hospital by a Dr. RICHARD
A. NELSON and the wounds around the eye and chin were sutured.
Four days later the sutures were removed.

SIRHAN reportedly suffered a brief injury again a
few days after the initial injury and the wound edge separated
a little bit. SIRHAN was unaware of any eye problems until he
began exercising the horses again at which time he had to move
his head from left to right in order to see well on either side.
This was especially noticeable in the left eye.

Because of his eye complaints, he was referred to
Dr. NELSON of Corona, California, and following this to Dr.
MILTON A. MILLER of Ontario, California.

SIRHAN complained of twitching of the left eye lid
when he looks to the left, wrinkles his forehead or makes
facial movements. He has had no subsequent unconscious
attacks, no dizziness, or other complaints except that of a
persistent pain in the superior nasal aspect of the left orbit.

Dr. KIEHN stated that he found SIRHAN's vision to
be 20-20 in either eye uncorrected and he had no significant
injuries to the eye. X-rays were negative.

He stated that he regarded the injury as having
functual overlay as the injury was not as serious as SIRHAN
believed.

He described SIRHAN as fairly neat and clean in
appearance and the aesthetic type with frail features.

He said that SIRHAN at times was very affable and
pleasant but he could also be very disturbed at times. He
stated that he saw SIRHAN twice a month after February 1967
through April and then SIRHAN did not show up for about six
months. He stated that in the meantime SIRHAN had seen Dr.
FORREST L, JOHNSON and Dr. ALBERT TASHMA.

He stated that from October through December he
saw SIRHAN about once a week to put drops in his eye which
seemed to alleviate the pain.

He stated that SIRHAN never discussed politics with
him and he knew little of his background.

Dr. KIEHN advised that as a result of his contact
with SIRHAN he did not consider him a stable person and
believes that he could be influenced by others.

He stated that Dr. MILLER told him that SIRHAN had
made some type of threat over an insurance report for the
eye injury. He stated that he believes SIRHAN mentioned that
he "would take care of him"(Dr. MILLER) if he did not write
a favorable report.

obtained the services of Attorney TOOMER to assist him ina
workmen's compensation case as a result of the eye injury sustained
while employed at the ranch.

He stated that SIRHAN impressed him as being unusually
cooperative and pleasant in spite of the fact that his examination
had reflected no physical detects.

Re: Mr. Sirhan Sirhan

Gentlemen:

Thank you for the reports of Dr. Tashma and others regarding this
interesting patient. I must admit that I will have to agree with Dr. Tashma
regarding the functional overlay in this particular patient. However in re-
checking him and seeing what his situation was I found that he had a loss of
accomodative power in the left eye of approximately two to three diopters.

I felt that possibly some of the pain in the left eye was due to a spasm of
accomodation and in order to test this out I placed him on drops of Hyocine %%.
When it was found that this indeed helped his pain I placed him on this,
putting e drop in at weekly intervals and then stopping the drop and seeing
“how he got along. His pain was relieved a great deal but recently he has again
started having a little bit of it so he was placed on another drop of Hyocine.
I think that the time interval between drops is gradually decreasing and it
should not be long before he would be completely off cf that medication, The
smali tight band toward the inner part of the eyelid in the epicanthal fold is
a problem apparently which bothers him but which I have been unable to really
sadequately evaluate. It is difficult to separate that which is functional and
that which is real in this patient. I would suggest that in order to be
absolutely sure it might be well for him to see an ophthalmic plastic surgeon,
someone Like Dr. Hartman in Los Angeles,

I trust this will give you an interim report on this patient, and
I am hoping that soon he wiil be able to get back to work.

Sincerely,
“£ _
