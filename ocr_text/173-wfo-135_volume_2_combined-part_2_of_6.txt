FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date_ 6/21/68

WILLIAM BARRY, 16 Overlook Road, New York City,
New York, (914-NE4-4541) advised that he was a Security
Officer assigned to the official KENNEDY party. He related
that he accompanied Senator KENNEDY ever since he entered the
primary presidential campaign.

BARRY related that he accompanied Senator KENNEDY
on his recent West Coast campaign and was his personal
representative in both the Oregon and Los Angeles primaries.
He related that during these travels, he at no time observed
SIRHAN SIRHAN, Senator KENNEDY's suspected assassin. He
related that the crowd was extremely large at the Ambassador
Hotel on the night when Senator KENNEDY gave his victory
speech. He mentioned that a large number of Latin Americans
were in attendance.

BARRY advised that it was often Senator KENNEDY's
habit to depart a specific area or podium by walking directly
through the crowd rather than by another designated exit.
After Senator KENNEDY's victory speech, an unknown individual,
possibly known to FRED DUITON stated "come this way" and
directed the Senator toward the kitchen hallway. The Senator
left the podium and departed the area by the rear exit be-
hind the stage and approached a hallway as BARRY assisted
Mrs. KENNEDY from the podium. Mrs. KENNEDY told BARRY "to
stay with the Senator,"

BARRY advised that it was planned that Senator
KENNEDY would attend an official celebration party with
volunteer workers of his campaign in the subbasement area
after his victory speech. He related that the Senator would
normally approach this area by turning left at the hallway
immediately behind the stage area, Instead, according to
BARRY, the Senator turned right after this unknown individual
directed him in that direction and proceeded through the

kitchen area in the direction of the Colonial Room, where
the press had set up temporary headquarters.

BARRY fought his way through a dense crowd in an
effort to circle the Senator's right flank and take his cus-
tomary position immediately in front of Senator KENNEDY.

BARRY added that someone decided that it was best that the
Senator see the "pencil press," so they could get their early
morning stories to their respective papers before going to the
victory party in another room.

As BARRY was fighting his way through the crowd
along the wall to the Senator's right and as he was directly
opposite him, he heard a sound which resembled a firecracker.
BARRY charged through the crowd directly toward Senator
KENNEDY and observed a white male with a gun. BARRY captured
this man, struck him twice and in attempting to get a headlock
on the man, the gun fell on a nearby table. The crowd was
intense and struck at the assailant and BARRY. His concern
was to protect the assailant and at the same time render
immediate aid to Senator KENNEDY. BARRY called ROOSEVELT
GRIER (pyefessional football player) to hold and protect the
assailant and at the same time, directed RAFER JOHNSON to
pick up the gun which was lying on the table. BARRY said
that during the switch, the assailant somehow again recovered
the gun as he made his way toward Senator KENNEDY. As he
approached the area where Senator KENNEDY was laying, he had
to fight back the crowd which was practically standing on
the Senator. He placed a jacket underneath the Senator's
head and the Los Angeles Police Department arrived at the
scene approximately six or seven minutes later.

BARRY mentioned that inasmuch as the assailant
appeared to be a Latin American, he was in no way distinguish-
able from the kitchen help in the Ambassador Hotel or a large
segment of the crowd which gathered for the Senator's victory
speech. He related that he did not observe the individual
who shot Senator KENNEDY prior to this occasion; BARRY re-
lated that he does not recall seeing a woman wearing a polka-
dot dress in the immediate area.

anyone could enter, Also on Tuesday night, the Colonial
Room was filled with people who were not with the Press

Mes. EMMA CHRISTOPHER, 6336 3lst Place, N.W., Tashineton,
D.C., furnished the following information:

Mrs. CHRISTOPHER was working as a volunteer worker at
the campaign headquarters for Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, 2000 L
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. (UDC), on Wednesday, May 29, 1968.
She was approached by SULEMAN KHATTAB, while she was stuffing
envelopes on the fifth floor, at approximately 12:00 noon. She
recognized him as a casual friend she had met in Boston, about
1960.

KHATTAB advised Mrs. CHRISTOPHER on May 29, 1968, that
he was also a volunteer worker at the Kennedy Headquarters. The
conversation lasted approximately five minutes during which time
KHATTAB commented he was displeased with his job in WDC, as a
language instructor. Mrs. CHRISTOPHER was not certain if he was
presently employed or had quit because of his dissatisfaction.
Mrs. CHRISTOPHER observed during the conversation, that KHATTAB
dominated the conversation. She recalled he acted in the same
manner when she previously knew him. His actions were not sus-
picious to her.

KHATTAB did not make any statements to Mrs. CHRISTOPHER
concerning Senator ROBERT KENNEDY, or express any political
opinions. She has not seen him since the conversation on May,
29. Following the assassination of Senator KENNEDY, Mrs. CHRIS-
TOPHER believed the authorities might be interested in KHATTAS,
since he was an Arab. “rs. CHRISTOPHER stated she recalled that
KHATTAB was a braggart and was considered somewhat a bore. She
stated KHATTAB was the type of person who complained frequently
about everything around him.

Mrs. CHRISTOPHER met KHATTAB about 1960, while she was
attending college in Boston, through her girl friend, MONA LAMBIRD,
