"ap a target position, approximately middle-ways
between us, and about in the middle of the pistol
range I assume from their physical appearance that
they were father and son. The younger individual

was approximately €O years of age and wearing an

Army type fatigue hat, with civilian clothes. His
build was small and he weighed about 150 - 160 pounds.
He was approximately 5, foot 6 inches tall. The

older man was between 45 and 50 years of age and weigh-
ed approximately175 péunds. He was wearing a

jacket and pants. His hair was ‘salt and pepper!
graying. I did not observe these individuals suffi-
ciently to furnish any additional description of them:
nor did I know either, or observe their mode of
arrival. I did not notice any conversations between
these 2 persons and the man on the west end of the
pistol range other than when they first arrived,

as mentioned above, which conversation I could not
hear.

‘About 20 minutes later, a white male and female
arrived at the range. :I.. noticed them because she was
the only female on the range and both had to walk near
me to enter the rifle range. They both went over on
the rifle range, where there were also other males,
unknown to me,also firing on the rifle range. I
did not talk to either of them. The man was a heavy
set male, 45 to 50 years of age, weighing 175 to 150
pounds. The woman was about 18 to 19 years of age,

5 foot 2 inches to 5 foot 3 inches tall, with a slender
build, weighing approximately 100 pounds. She had

blond hair and was wearing a scarf. She was shooting a
.22 caliber rifle. She had on slacks. This is all

I can recall of their description, Neither of these

two persons ever came over to the pistol range. I cannot
recall anyone from the pistol]. range ever soing over

to the rifle range to talk with then.

CLAUDIA JUNE WILLIAMS, 2428 Sierra Leone Street,
Rowland Heights, California, telephone 965-1870, was
interviewed by SA GEORGE M. KLING and Detective Sergeant
MIKE MC GANN, Homicide Division, Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD). After identifying themselves as being
a Special Agent of the FBI and a Detective Sergeant of the
LAPD, respectively, WILLIAMS supplied the following information:

She is currently employed as a barmaid at the
Briar Patch Bar, B23 East Live Oak, Arcadia, California,
telephone number 445-3050.

On June 4, 1968, she and her husband, RONALD,
decided to go to the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, 4001 Fish
Canyon Road, Duarte, California, for the purpose of target
shooting. She stated that they left the children at a
babysitter, MARGIE THROM, telephone number 965-1094, and then
stopped by the Briar Patch Bar in order to obtain directions
to the gun range as neither she nor her husband had ever been
‘to the range before. After receiving directions, they
proceeded to the general vicinity of the range until they
met a Temple City Deputy Sheriff from whom they asked
additional directions. She stated that she thought the
Deputy Sheriff was named RON LANDER. She stated that they
arrived at the range at approximately 3:50 PM.

WILLIAMS further advised that it was her intention
to shoot.a .22 caliber revolver which she had received for
Christmas in 1966, yet had never fired the gun. At this
point, WILLIAMS brought forth the gun which she said that
she had taken to the range on June 4, 1968; and it was
personally observed that the gun was a .22 caliber High
Standard Double Nine nine shot revolver bearing serial
number 1553884 and possessing bone or ivory colored handles.
She stated that her husband had just recently purchased a
rifle from the Gemco Store in La Puente, California, and it
was his desire to practice with this gun at the range.

WILLIAMS brought forth the rifle which she said her husband
had taken to the range on June 4, 1968, and it was personally
observed to be a 30-30 caliber Marlin, Serial Number AC11147,
capable of holding seven rounds of ammunition.

WILLIAMS further advised that upon arriving at
the range and being informed by the Range Officer that the
range closed for firing at 5:00 PM, she and her husband
engaged in a discussion as to whether to go ahead and fire
on the range after paying the admission fee since they were
going to be able to fire for a relatively short time. She
stated that she recalled saying something to the effect
that she had had the gun for a long time and since they
already were there, she wanted to shoot it today. She
stated that her husband had told the Range Officer that
she wanted to shoot the pistol and he wanted to go to the
rifle range. After the attendant told them that they could
not fire both weapons on the same range, they decided to
proceed to the respective ranges and do some shooting.
WILLIAMS then went to a firing position close.to the range
house and, as best as she can recall, it was around firing
position 22 or 23. She stated that the Range Officer put
her target in place for her and she started shooting.

WILLIAMS stated when she went to the pistol range,
there was only one other individual on the range firing at
@ position about midway along the firing range. As best as
she can recall, this individual was firing around position
9 or 10, After firing about 18 rounds, WILLIAMS stated she
was having difficulty firing the gun and she called to the
individual firing down the range from her and asked him if
he knew anything about guns. The individual came over to
her and proceeded to give’ her instructions regarding the
firing of the gun, how to get a proper sight picture, and
other basic fundamentals of firing procedure,

WILLIAMS described this individual as about
5'2" to 513" in height, 25 years of age, dark curly hair,
small build, bare headed, wearing casual clothes, and
appearing to be of Spanish or Italian extraction. At this

point, WILLIAMS was shown several photographs, including

the photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN, and WILLIAMS stated that

the photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN was definitely the individual
whom she had seen and asked for assistance at the range.

She stated that after some discussion with SIRHAN
about firing procedure, SIRHAN took her gun and fired about
18 or 20 rounds with it and then gave her further instructions
on proper firing procedures. SIRHAN then asked her if she
wanted to fire his gun. She stated that he had a small
black or blue colored gun and was firing Mini Magnum shells.
WILLIAMS stated that she did not know very much about guns and
could not tell what make, model or caliber the gun was.
She stated that she proceeded to shoot about two chambers
of ammunition from SIRHAN's gun but that she did not know
how many rounds the gun actually held. She stated that
there was no one else on the pistol range at this time
other than she and SIRHAN, She said that SIRHAN was at
her position giving instructions and firing for approximately
20 minutes. She stated that while SIRHAN was still at her
position, her husband returned from the rifle range and they
engaged in a short conversation at that point, concerned
mostly about SIRHAN's gun,

She further advised that they were at the range
for a period of about one hour and, after being told by the
Range Officer that firing had to cease on the range, she
and her husband left for home. She stated that she and her
husband had to make some preparations prior to leaving the
range and she thought STRHAN had left approximately five
minutes before their departure. She stated that she did not
observe any vehicle which SIRHAN may have been driving.

She stated that she had never seen SIRHAN before
that time on the range. There was no one else on the pistol
range except she and SIRHAN. She stated that their conversation
had concerned itself entirely with firearms and that he made
no reference to any future plans,

WILLIAMS stated after Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, she saw
a photograph of SIRHAN shown on television and she remarked
to her husband that this was the same individual whom they
had seen and talked with at the range. She stated she then
