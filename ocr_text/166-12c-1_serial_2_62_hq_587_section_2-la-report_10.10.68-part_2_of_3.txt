liy Gear ones,

I don't know whether I thanked you or replied to your
last dear letter, but if this is the casé, it was unintentional,
and so now I will thank you twice. I am always very glad when
I hear from you and your letters are very dear to me! The
Gay before yesterday I received a letter from Greta Musilova
which saddeneé me very much. Karel is gravely ill, as you
know it well yourselves, and there is no hope for his recovery.
The coctor gives him one year to live, and this is great suffering,

not only for ham (he doesn't know it) but also for Greta. She

has had more than her share of troubles already. I am very sorry
for her and think of her all the time. Write to her soon, but in
such a way that Karel could read it, too. So, I cannot write all
about him (what Greta wrote to me). Mirek finished his course of
stucy and now is waiting for a place (employment). He was here
‘all of April when he finished his studies. He came down with his
brother-in-law, who was going to Germany on official business, and
so he stoppedhere, too. I was very pleased, because one never
knows whether or not we will see each other again. We talkec about
you all. Last week he left and I wish very much that he finds
something suitable; otherwise I suppose he will return (two
illegible words). As you certainly lmow, things are a little

more relaxed here. Freedom is the most precious thing one can

have and we (the people) have not even suspected for the whole
twenty years what an orgy has been carried on behind our backs.

We hope for better times.

They announced over the radio this morning that
Robert Kennedy was shot - for God's sake, what is goingon ~ and
it always happens to the best ones! When you write to me, Paul,
tell me about it. -4s I became old, I became interested in politics
and in everytning arounc me. What about your house? Have you
sold it yet" Do not hurry; you would miss it and the garden, and
I would lose a pleasant memory about the place where I spent a
number of nice days.

Is Lilinka well? I wish you both much health for as
long as possible. I already feel my years, slowly but surely.

Irena,will possibly fly again with Max to the U.S. for
ner (?) sons (?). She wrote to me to come with Emily to Vienna for
three days. We shall see. Poor people, they have it so uncertain
again - such is the world - disgusting:

I give my best regards to your children, also to the
Golésneiders - Tony and Flero (?). I think of you and kiss you.

Iucka (Ludmila).

Mrs. FRANCES EVANS, 11125 Hibbing, Cerritos,
California, advised she attended an adult education class
in Introduction to Philosophy from September, 1967, to
January, 1968, at Fullerton Junior College. The instructor
was KIM NAFFA. In addition to the class there discussion
groups held at various places made up of interested individuals.
NAFFA had many Arab friends that attended the: .:. discussion
that were not members of the class. They discussed current
problems in the mid-Rast and their problems with the
Zionists and the like.

Generally those in attendance at these discussion
groups had the viewpoint that there ig a revolution now in
progress in the world and on the campuses, which they
favored. In general these people, if not pro-communist, were
at least one world advocates,

NAFFA did not appear as radical as some of the
people present but supported the Arab viewpoint.

During November, 1967, at one of the discussion
groups held at NAFFA's home at hos Barry Place, Placentia,
California, after the group had concluded, three or four
Jordanians stopped in from Pasadena. Some were studying
at Pasadena City College. One of those from Pasadena spoke
with guiet desperation about how his father's land and home
had been taken from them twice by the Zionists. He
commented to the effect "to heck! with Philosophy, if the
communists would help them why not go with them.

She said that later on after Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY was shot, she saw a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN on
TV. She said that she is 99 per cent sure that this was the
person she saw at NAFFA's who talked about how his #@eher's land
and home had been taken. o

SAMUEL TOLCH, 7041 Coldwater Canyon, North
Hollywood (764-7631) was interviewed at his place of
employment, Nardoni Bail Bonds, 943 North Vignes (624-7731),
and furnished the following information: ~

In May 1963, exact date unrecalled, he attended
a gathering in support of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY at the
Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles. According
to TOLCH, this function was originally scheduled to include
an appearance by Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, but featured
Senator EDWARD KENNEDY when ROBERT KENNEDY was detained
campaigning in San Francisco, California.

Shortly after arriving at the Embassy Room at
approximately 9:20 p.m., TOLCH observed a dark- complexioned -white
male individual standing near a hallway leading from the
Embassy Room to the kitchen area, approximately 15 feet
from the side of the stage. TOLCH further described this
individual as being 25 ~ 20 years of age, approximately
515", 140 pounds, thin build, very curly dark hair, and
wearing blue, jeans and a light colored pullover knit type
shirt. Between 9:30 and approximately 11:20 p.m. when TOLCH
left the hotel, he walked by the area near the kitchen hall
three or four times and observed this individual standing
in the same location. According to TOLCH, this individual
appeared to be by himself. At no time did TOLCH observe
this individual talk with anyone or circulate among the crowd.

TOLCH further advised that ,following the shooting
of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY and the publication of photographs
of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in local newspapers, he observed a
photograph of SIRHAN and immediately recognized it as very
closely resembling the above described individual he observed
at the Ambassador Hotel in May 1963.

TOLCH was shown additional photographs of SIRHAN,
including a photograph taken June 5, 1963, by the Los Angeles
Police Department, and, after viewing same, advised that he
is certain in his own mind that the individual he observed is
identical to the photographs of SIRHAN.

HARRIET LESSNER, 4318 Colbath, Sherman Oaks,
California, was interviewed at the Sawyer School of Business,
5352 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, at which time she furnished
the following information:

In mid-May 1968, she volunteered to work for
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY in the Sherman Oaks area. About
ten days before the assassination of Senator KENNEDY, she
attended, along with her father and four year old daughter,
a rally at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles,California.

Just as she was entering the hotel with her daughter,

she had conversation with an unknown white male concerning

the excitement of her daughter at the prospect of shaking
hands with Senator KENNEDY. In the course of this exchange,
the man said, "Wouldn't it be something if she lives to tell
about it." She thought this comment was very strange and
simply said to the man that she certainly hoped her daughter
would. After saying this to the man, she went on into the
hotel to await the appearance of Senator KENNEDY.

While in the hotel waiting for Senator KENNEDY,
she heard rumors that he was to come through the kitchen
entrance into the Cocoanut Grove Room. In an effort to get
close to the Senator, she went to the area of the kitchen
entrance where she again observed the same man who had spoken
to her concerning her daughter. The man was wearing a dark
jacket and at the time she thought the jacket rather heavy
in view of the fact the room was quite stuffy. Also, the
man did not have on a tie and did not appear to be dressed
for the occasion. Senator KENNEDY did not come through the
kitchen entrance and when he did enter the room she lost
sight of the man and did not see him again that night.

After the assassination of Senator KENNEDY, she
observed photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN on television

Mrs. DAVIS advised that on Sunday, June 2, 1958, she
was at the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles
as a hostess for a reception in honor of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY sponsored by Assemblyman LEON RALPH. She stated that
she arrived at the hotel at approximately 7:30 PM and that
she and the rest of the individuals at the reception awaited
the arrival of Senator KENNEDY in the Cocoanut Grove ballroom
until approximately 9:00 PM, at which time Senator KENNEDY
arrived. He spoke approximately for five minutes and then left,
leaving the hotel by at léast 9:30 PM.

Mrs. DAVIS advised that after Senator KENNEDY had
left and the crowd had begun to disperse she and her daughter
and husband went into the.kitchen area on the same floor as
the Cocoanut Grove ballroom looking for a place to get a drink
of water. She stated that as they approached the kitchen they
saw a man sitting on a bar inside the kitchen in dark pants and
a T-shirt and she described him as a short, swarthy, bushy-
haired individual. Mrs. DAVIS advised that she at first thought
this man was a waiter and asked him where the water was and
he replied that he did not Know. By this she got the impression
that he might not have been an employee of the hotel.

Mrs. DAVIS advised that after the assassination of
Senator KENNEDY on June 4, 1968, when she saw the pictures,on
the television and in the newspaper,of the man known as SIRHAN
’ BISHARA SIRHAN, she immediately recognized him as the same man
that she had seen in the kitchen. She stated that she was fairly
certain that it was the same individual and if it was not that
it was someone who certainly looked exactly like SIRHAN.

She advised that she did not attend the rally at the
Ambassador Hotel on the night of the assassination and that she
did not see the individual in the kitchen at any other time
except when the picture appeared in the newspaper.

Immediately after the shooting of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY,

This check did not reflect that SIRHAN SIRHAN had ever been

FAWZI ZEDAN, 555 Tamaric Drive, Pasadena,
furnished the following information:

He arrived in the United States from his native
Syria on December 5, 1963, at the port of New York under a
student visa. He immediately journeyed to California and
enrolled at Pasadena City College (PCC) for the Spring
semester of 1964,

During the Fall semester of 1964, he met SIRHAN
STRHAN, a fellow PCC student, in the school cafeteria where
Arab students frequently congregated, He described his
relationship with SIRHAN as a casual acquaintanceship, which
was limited solely to the PCC campus or Bob's Coffee Shop
which neighbors the PCC campus.

ZEDAN believes SIRHAN SIRHAN left PCC about
February 1965, however, SIRHAN would frequently drop by the
school cafeteria to pass the time of day with Arab students.
On those occasions when ZEDAN observed SIRHAN entering or
leaving the cafeteria, SIRHAN was always alone, and ZEDAN
did not believe that STRHAN ever visited the cafeteria to
see any particular person.

ZEDAN last saw SIRHAN SIRHAN approximately five
days before the assassination of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.
SIRHAN came into Bob's Coffee Shop while ZRTAN was waiting
to be seated, and they engaged in a brief conversation.
SIRHAN kidded ZEDAN about still being a student at PCC after
five years, and ZEDAN explained that he had graduated but
still liked to spend his spare time at Bob's. SIRHAN, who
was alone, appeared calm and relaxed to ZEDAN but declined
ZEDAN's invitation to coffee and left the restaurant.

ZEDAN reiterated that his friendship with SIRHAN
SIRHAN was very casual and based largely on the fact they
were of a common ethnic background. On only one occasion

nature. Approximately five months after the Arab-Israeli
conflict of 1967, SIRHAN approached ZEDAN in Bob's Restaurant
and stated, "Well, they lost." Not having seen SIRHAN

since prior to the conflict, ZEDAN did not understand SIRHAN's
comment, and he asked SIRHAN what he meant. SIRHAN explained,
"Back home." ZEDAN then understood SIRHAN to be referring

to the conflict but did not comment, except to answer,

"Yes." In ZEDAN's opinion, although SIRHAN was smiling,

the tone of his (SIRHAN's) voice was bitter, but the
conversation ended then, as SIRHAN left the restaurant.

Again SIRHAN STRHAN was alone.

ZEDAN concluded that he was not aware of any close

SIRHAN was not a member of the Pasadena Chapter of the

Mrs. NELL RADER, Apartment C, 10717 Victory Boulevard,
telephone number 763-7575, furnished the following information:

Mrs. RADER lives by herself at the above address and
she is retired. She was recently hospitalized for gallstones
and hernia and expects to return to the hospital in the near
future for surgery.

In May 1968, Mrs. RADER worked part time, two
evenings, as a campaign worker at the Robert Kennedy Campaign
Office located on Victory Boulevard near Whitsett Avenue,

North Hollywood, California. Mrs. RADER was an enthusiastic
supporter of ROBERT KENNEDY for the presidential nomination.

On Sunday, June 2, 1968, she went, by herself, to the rally

held for ROBERT KENNEDY at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles,
California. When she arrived at this rally, she did not feel
well. As a result, she did not participate in the activities

of this rally at the Ambassador Hotel. Instead, she sat in a
chair in the hallway outside of the Cocoanut Grove Room at

this hotel by herself. Her chair was not close to the entrance
of the Cocoanut Grove Room. She was unable to estimate the dis-
tance from the entrance, but was sure she sat on the south side
of the hotel. There was a large number of people milling

around the lobby and hallway near her. While sitting there,

she saw an individual standing by a swinging door who she

later believed to be SIRHAN SIRHAN. She based her identi-
fication of SIRHAN on numerous pictures she later saw of

SIRHAN in the newspapers and on television. This individual

was just standing there in the hallway and acted as if he

were a waiter at the hotel. The reason Mrs. RADER thought

he was a waiter was that he carried a white cloth or towel

in his left hand. She was unable to describe this cloth or
towel further. After seeing this individual for several seconds
he disappeared behind the swinging door. The individual, be-
lieved to be SIRHAN, did not talk to her or to anyone else. She
was by herself at the time she observed this individual. She
had never seen him before and she had no knowledge of SIRHAN or
his family.

tion of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, the Los Angeles Police
Department found several items in the vehicle belonging to
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, which was found parked near the Ambassador
Hotel on the morning of June 5, 1968 shortly after the assassina-
tion took place. One of the items found in the vehicle was a
Hollywood Park Race Track parking ticket Number 59600, red in
color.

On July 29, 1968, Mr. ANTHONY TREEBOW, Operations
Department, Hollywood Park Race Track, advised that he could
not determine the exact date that the above-described parking
ticket had been used. He stated that the different colors
indicated several different days when this ticket might have
been used and that the number could not be used to determine
exactly the date of its use inasmuch as these numbers were
often repeated after a cycle was completed.

Mr. TREEBOW advised that the dates on which red
colored parking tickets were usedinthe present racing season

In connection with the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, the Los Angeles Police Department found
several items in the car owned by SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. One
of these items was a Richfield Oil Company credit card receipt
dated May 20, 1968 and bearing license number JWS 093, which
is the license number of the car belonging to SIRHAN.

On duly 29, 1963, Mr. GLENDON AYERS, Manager of the
Richfield Station at 14614 East Daléwood, Baldwin Park, where
the above~described credit card receipt was issued, advised
that inasmuch as both the hard and flimsy copies of the receipt
were found in the car, this would indicate that it had been
issued as a cash recéipt at the request of tne customer. He
stated that the number 0377 which was found on the receipt would
undoubtedly indicate a $3.77 purchase and that any other iden-
tifying data on the receipt would probably be the date, station
number, and initial of the issuing employee.

Mr. AYERS was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN and he advised that he did not recall this individual
and is sure that he is not anyone who nas been a regular or
semi-regular customer at that station. He stated that the
first time he ever saw the individual in the photograph was when
he saw his picture on television following the assassination.
