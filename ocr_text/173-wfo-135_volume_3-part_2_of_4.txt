INFORMATION: (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY & HOW)
Bailey, a reporter for the Minneappolis Tribune, was in the Colonial
Room for the 30: minutes prior to the shooting of Senator Kennedy.
. : \ .
- He received word from one of the Kennedy press aids, that Kenne-ay
would go to the Colonial Room after his spaech. He watched the speech
on T.V. and was st-anding in the Colonial Room approximately 10 feet
from the kitchen door when he heard shots.

Bailey's first impressions of the noise, was a person banging a
tin tray against something, but by the time he heard the fifth noise, he
was sureit was shdts.

Bailey and two or three others charged into the kitchen, and had
some trouble getting through the crowd. He obnserved a fight over a
steam table and saw a hand sticking out of the melee, with a gun in it.
He was not able to see the suspect. He saw Kennedy lying on the £loor,
and went into the Colonial Room to call his paper.

Bailey tried one phone in the press room and found it dead. He
went to the phone bootnas in the alcove by the Controller's office and was
phoning when he saw a suspect brought by the phone booth by two or
three officers.

This suspect was wearing grey sport clothing and was taken down
the stairs to the Security office. He does not know if it was the
suspect from the kitchen. (INVESTIGATOR"S NOTE: This sounds like
MICHAEL WAYNE I-1096).

Bailey did not see Sirhan prior to the shooting. He did not see
a girl in a polka-dot dress. He did not have a camera. He has been
interviewe@ by agent Wilkinson, Wash. F3I office. He has made state-
ments to the paper he works for. . eee aad,

the Embassy Ballroom, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles,
California, at the time of the assassination of Senator
