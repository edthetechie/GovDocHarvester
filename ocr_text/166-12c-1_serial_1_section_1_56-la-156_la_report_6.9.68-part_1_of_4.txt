NARRATIVE OF EVENTS
CONCERNING SHOOTING FROM
LOCAL NEWS MEDIA __

At approximately 12:15 a.m., June 5, 1968, moments after
delivering an election victory speech before a crowd of approx-
imately 1,000 people in the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel,
3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY was shot by an unidentified assailant. The shooting
occurred as Senator KENNEDY and his entourage left the ballroom
through a kitchen exit.

The assailant, later identified as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN,
fired a series of shots in rapid succession, injuring five other
individuals in the melee.

As Senator KENNEDY fell backward onto the floor, SIRHAN
was seized by Los Angeles Rams Lineman ROOSEVELT GRIER and
wrestled to the floor by GREER and former Olympic Decathlon
Champion RAFER JOHNSON, who disarmed SIRHAN of a .22 caliber
revolver.

SIRHAN, who carried no identification and refused to
admit his identity, was turned over to the Los Angeles Police
Department and booked as "John Doe" on a charge of assault with
intent to commit murder.

Senator KENNEDY, at that time, was believed to have
been shot in the head and right shoulder and was subsequently
taken to the Los Angeles Central Receiving Hospital for emergency
treatment. He was immediately thereafter transported to Hospital
of the Good Samaritan, 1212 Shatto Street, Los Angeles, which is
approximately three and one-half blocks from the Central Receiving
Hospital.

Upon his arrival at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan,
six neurosurgeons operated on Senator KENNEDY for approximately
four hours to remove the .22 caliber bullet which had fragmented
into several parts in his right brain area.

"At about 12:25 a.m., I was in the ambulance
office with several other drivers and attendants.
I noticed a yellow cab drive to ambulance entrance
of hospital. There was a motorcycle escort guard
with the taxi cab. One of the passengers of the cab
entered room requesting help because someone had
been shot. Then, aboit six drivers and attendants
went outside to ambulance ramp and observed a young
white male sitting in rear of the cab. I assisted
him removing him from the cab and placed him in a
wheechair. I determined he had bullet wounds in his
left leg. Attendant TOM RATLIFF took the patient
into the hospital and I ordered the cab and the motor-
cycle to clear the ambulance area. The man who came
in the ambulance office told us KENNEDY was shot.

"At this time, approximately 12:30 a.m. am-
bulance G-18 arrived at the ambulance ramp. The
ambulance backed up to the dock. I opened the rear
door of the ambulance. I opened the Gilson belt, a
belt which covers the rear door and is a protective
‘device in case the rear doors of the ambulance doors
open. In the rear of the ambulance, I observed
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY on the stretcher. x
BEHRMANN, the attendant was at the rear of the ambulance.
Mrs. ETHEL KENNEDY was sitting next to BEHRMANN.
There was at least another white female in the ambu-
lance rear. ROBERT HULSMAN was the ambulance driver.
In the cab, I observed Mr. BARRY, KENNEDY's bodyguard
and at least one other person ridins in the cab. Dr.
BAZILAUSKAS entered the amoulance and attended to Mr.
KENNEDY. I released the stretcher and proceeded to
roll it from the ambulance. We wheeled the stretcher
inside the hospital to treatment room j! 2. As we were
entering room #2, Mrs, KENNEDY, grabbed a camera
from a news cameraman and knocked it to the floor.
She also swung at him and hit him in the chest area.

"KENNEDY's bodyguard jumped over the stretcher and
attacked the photographer. They wrestled with each
other for several seconds and were separated by L.A.P.D.
officers, Hospital Detail. I then wheeled the stret- s#r
cher into room j! € and helped lift Mr. KENNEDY onto

the treatment table. I removed the stretcher from

room #2. In treatment room j/ 2, there were doctors,
nurses, and members of the KENNEDY group.

"T was then paged over the public address
system and dispatched to the Ambassador Hotel as
a request for 2.more ambulances had been received.
RATLIFF and I drove ambulance G-15 to the hotel.
On arrival, we were guided to rear entrance of
the hotel. We took our stretcher and first-aid kit
and entered the hotel by the rear entrance. We
were guided to the freight elevator which we took
to the third floor. We were guided through the
corridors. We located one victim in a corridor. He
was lying on the floor. We examined him and de-
termined he was not critical. I do not recall his
injuries. We left him and told him a private ambu-
lance following us would take him. We were led into
the Embassy Room where we found Mrs. EVANS. She
was just to the left of the speakers stand in the Em-
bassy Room. The room very crowded with people. The
time was about 12:40 a.m. Mre. EVANS was lying on
her back on a table. There was a man, who claimed he
was a doctor attending to her. He said she had a
'bleeder' in the forehead. RATLIFF and I examined her
and determined she had a laceration on her forehead.
We applied a pressure dressing over the wound and
placed her on the stretcher. We were then advised
of another injury of a photographer who had been
hit in the head with a camera. We examined him and
determined he had a laceration on the rear -of the
head. We took both patients down the freight ele-
vator and out the rear entrance. We loaded them in

"in the ambulance and proceeded to Centval Receiv-
ing, Code 3. On arrival at the hospital, we unloaded
the patients and placed them in treatment rooms.

"At about 1:00 a.m. I went to treatment room
jf 2 and assisted transferring Mr. KENNEDY from
treatment table to stretcher. We wheeled the
stretcher out to the loading ramp and placed it
into ambulance G-16. Mrs. KENNEDY and several
other people in the KENNEDY group and a doctor went
in this ambulance which was transferring Mr.
KENNEDY from Central Receiving Hospital to Good
Samaritan Hospital at Lucas and Shatto St. about
4 blocks from Central Receiving. During the tine
we were loading Mr. KENNEDY into ambulance, the
hospital corridors and entrance were jammed with
crowds. We were slowed in our efforts to load him
into the ambulance due to the large unruly crond
in and in front of the hospital.

"During the course of the entire affair, I saw
or heard nothing whieh could aid in identifying
a suspect or could be evidence to the shooting.

"T have read thie written statement which is
six pages long. I have initialed all page and cor-
rections. This is a true statement.

"T then saw a man described as a white
male, American, six feet tall, 175 pounds,
wearing an olive green suit and he said to me,
‘pring a stretcher, follow me up the stairs.

I was rolling the stretcher and knew I could
not get it up the stairs I and my driver then
went to an elevator and a hotel employee
described as a white male 5 feet, 160 pounds,
who I know as a handyman took us to the second
floor I then went to the second floor kitchen
and it was very crowded and congested. I noted
as I came near the victim there was a woman
wiping the forehead of this individual with a
cloth. I noted a white male, unknown to ime,
close by the victim.

"T then noted a pool of blood under-
neath the head of the victim. I knealt down
again to pick Mr. Kennedy up and place him on
the stretcher. As I knelt down by the victim
the woman wiping the victim's head tried to
pull me away and said, ‘keep your hands off of
him, I'm Mrs. Kennedy,"

"T then said to Mrs. Kennedy, 'We are
from Central Receiving Hospital, Emergency
Ambulance Crew and we are here to help you.'!
Mrs. Kennedy then replied 'I don't care who you
are.!

"T then said to Mrs. Kennedy, 'We had
a call here, If you don't want me to examine
your husband, what do you want me to do?!

"T then heard an unknown white male
standing close by say, ‘Hurry hurry lets get
him on the stretcher. '

"T then heard Mr. Kennedy say, 'No

no don't please.' At this point Mrs. Kennedy
tried to pull me away."

"The driver and myself then put Mr.
Kennedy on the stretcher, and wrapped him in
a blanket. I noted the white male pushing
people away from in front of the stretcher
and some people were falling over and tripping
over each other We got on the elevator with
Mrs. Kennedy and a white male and the previ-
ously mentioned handyman was controlling the
elevator.

“The elevator went by the first
floor to the basement and then returned to
the first floor. At this point I had not heard
that the victim, Mr. Kennedy, had been shot.

"I then moved the stretcher out of
the elevator and out to the ambulance. I
noted that the white male was pulling on the
stretcher so that I could not move it along and
he said, 'take it easy.'

; "T then said to this white male, ‘For
Christs sake, let go so I can get him to the
ambulance. !

"I then heard Mrs. Kennedy say, 'Don't
hurry don't hurry.' I did not specifically
notice any policemen immediately around me but
it was extremely congested and people were
shoving each other around. We lifted Mr. Kennedy
into the ambulance and locked the stretcher in
place. I then said to Mrs. Kennedy 'Would you
get in please'. I observed standing with her
was a white, male, American, age 60, wéight 150,
5 feet 8 -inches, medium build receeding lt.
brown hair, wearing a dark brown suit.

"This man then got into the ambulance
and then Mrs. Kennedy entered the ambulance and
I entered it. The driver, Hulsman came to the
rear and started to fasten the safety webbing."

"TI said, 'Robert, please come on lets go to the
hospital.' Robert then closed the doors. I
then noted that Mrs. Kennedy opened 1 door and
pointed to a white, female, wearing a white dress
and said, 'I want that lady in white to go with
me.'

"T recall that just prior to Mrs.
Kennedy opening rear door mentioned above I took
Mr. Kennedys pulse and I would say it was very

weak.

"T then said to Mrs. Kennedy, 'No, I'm
not taking her with me.' I said to the driver,
'Bob come on close the doors, lets go.' The

driver was having difficulty closing the rear
doors and I said 'Put them in the front seat and
lets go.!

"T then said to Mrs. Kennedy, ‘Just for
the records, Please, what happened?' At this point
Mrs. Kennedy said, 'I dont give a damn what you
say' and at this point Mrs. Kennecy grabbed my
ambulance call record book and threw it out of
the rear of the ambulance. I had noted on the
ambulance call record ticket the following infor-
mation: number B 20588, date 6/5/68, Division
G 18, location Ambassador Hotel, received 12:17. A.M.
and arrived at location 12:22 AM., Name Kennedy,

"I then noted that the driver closed the
rear doors and I said, ‘Come one Bob lets go,
We've got a police escort.' I noted a police car
in front of our ambulance and just before we
pulled out 2 white males got in the front with
the driver and we left.

"T noted that Mr. Kennedy was taking

deep breaths, I reached over him to get an air-
wick to insert in Mr. Kennedy's throat to aid"

"hispreathing prior to putting on an air-mask
but elected not to use it (the air wick) in
view of Mrs. Kennedy's behavior. I then reached
under Mr. Kennedy's head to lift it up so I
might put the band over his head which holds

the air mask.

"At this point Mrs. Kennedy said,
'Yyou keep your Girty filthy hands off my hus-
band.' 'Mrs. Kennedy then said, 'How do you know
the air ig on?! and I replied, “you can hear it.'

"As we were proceeding to the hospital
I again asked Mrs. Kennedy, ‘Can you tell me
what happened?' and she replied, ‘I don't give
a Goddamn what you want to know.'

"I then tried to place the previously
mentioned guaze compress on the left side of
Mr. Kennedy's head as he was bieeding profusely
and breathing in deep gasps. At this point IL
was struck on the right side of my face by Mrs.
Kennedy and I can only state I was stunned.

"T next recall Mrs. Kennedy saying
"Bruce, come back here and throw this ambulance
man out; he's bothering me; he's asking too many
questions.'!

"TI next recall that the white male was
attempting to crawl through from the cab to the
body of the ambulance. At this point the driver
pulled him back and said, 'Sit there or you can
cause an accident.'!

; "As the ambulance approached the hospi-
tal I could see that a large number of people had
gathered, As Robert tried to back the ambulance
up to the off-leading dock an individual by the
name of Rus, who is employed at the hospital as
an ambulance driver opened the rear doors and
dropped the webbing. At this point Dr. Bas"

"(phonetic, not his full name) entered the
ambulance and I said to him, ‘What do you want
Doc?! and he replied I want to examine Mr.
Kennedy.' I then said to Dr. Bas, ‘Not here
Doc, in the treatment room where you belong.'

"I next recall getting out of the
ambulance and then Mrs. Kennedy got out. The
driver and I took the stretcher out and started
to go through the entry doors. At this point
a photographer took two pictures and Mrs.
Kennedy then said 'Get that man', and pointed
at the photographer. I then observed the white
male leap over the stretcher and strike the
photographer full in the face and he fell to
the ground.

"T then worked the stretcher through
the crowd and into treatment room number 2.
I then heard Dr. Bas say, 'Come on, hurry let's
get him on the table so I can examine him.'
At this point Dr. Bas placed his hands under the
middle back of Mr. Kennedy and attempted to lift
Mr. Kennedy up onto the table. I observed that
Dr. Bas lifted Mr. Kennedy approximately 1 and
+; feet (1s) off the stretcher and Robert and
myself brought the stretcher up as he was
being lifted. At this point Dr. Bas lost his
balance and he (Dr. Bas) falls forward toward
the table and placed Mr. Kennedy on the table.
I observed that when Dr. Bas lifted Mr. Kennedy
the oxygen bottle that was between his legs fell
to the floor and the air mask was subsequently
left on Mr. Kennedy's face but the air tube had
been pulled out.

"At this point the driver and myself
took the other items, put them on the stretcher
and moved it out of treatment room #2.
"at this point, in the hall, I pointed
to the white male previously referred to as having"

"struck the photographer and I said, ‘I want to

file a complaint against him.' This was said in the
presence of a Los Angeles Detective who is normally
stationed at Central Receiving Hospital.

"At this point the previously mentioned
individual above said to me, 'I'm going to file
a complaint against you too; what's your name?!
I then said, 'Ask my supervisor he's right over
there,' and I pointed to Mr. Paul Clum my immed-
late supervisor.

"The next event I can recall is that
the dispatcher notified me that I should return
to the Ambassador Hotel as there had been a shooting.
I then said to Norma Case, the dispatcher, 'In
other words, Mr. Kennedy that we just brought in
has been shot,' and she said 'I guess so.' The
dispatcher then told me they were sending 5 or 6
more ambulances to the Ambassador Hotel.

"T then returned to the Ambassador Hotel
and picked up a white male, age 52 - 55, weight
200, name not given, who indicated to me that he
had been shot. After the driver and I placed this
man in the ambulance a Negro male, age 50, wearing a
dark brown suit stated he was a Doctor and re-
quested to go along in the ambulance. I was
further requested by a white male wearing a white
shirt and a dark tie who identified himself as a
Doctor, if he could also go along in the ambulance
and I indicated he could. This individual being
transported was asked by me, 'Would you like me to
remove the hat from beneath your head and he
replied, 'No I'm fine, tell your partner to go
fast, but not too fast’.

"The next event I can recall after
returning to the hospital was a telephone call
I received from an officer at the Los Angeles
Police Department Intelligence Division whose name"

as Barry had 'complained charges' against you,
that you struck Mrs. Kennedy.

"T replied that I did not touch her
at any time other than to help her into the
ambulance, but Mre. Kennedy did strike me, and I
further advised him of all the details of the
early morning hours of June 5, 1968,

"I remained at the hospital until approxi-
