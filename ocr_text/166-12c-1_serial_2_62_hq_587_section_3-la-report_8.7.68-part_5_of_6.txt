Mr, RON SMITH, Owner, Cal-fex Industries, 1833 North
Eastern Avenue, Los Angeles, California, employer of JOHN
FAHEY, advised that FAHEY had described the incident occurring
at the boulder on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California,
as follows:

FAHEY was seated in his car with the unknown blond
woman and advised that he got out of his car and could see
the unidentified man standing behind the boulder holding a
gun. FAHEY told SMITH that he practically crawled back into
his car and that it hurt in his chest and his side. FAHEY
exclaimed to SMITH that he could still feel it and that he
was scared to death. FAHEY further advised SMITH that a
waitress at the Trancas Restaurant, 30765 Pacific Coast
Highway, Malibu (North), California, had remembered both
himself and the blond woman on June 4, 1968, having dinner.

SMITH advised that upon reviewing FAHEY's application
for employment that there are three employments on the
application that FAHEY failed to advise SA EUGENE B. MC CARTHY
of. These are Interchemical, Los Angeles, California,

January 1967, to March 1967, employed as an Outside Salesman;
Thomas Brothers Maps, South La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles,

June 1967, through December 1967, and Gensler Jewelry,

955 Market Street, San Francisco, California, from March 1963,
until April 1964, SMITH advised that he did not perform

any background check on FAHEY and has not contacted any of

his previous employers. SMITH advised that FAHEY is only a
fair employee, that he has only worked at Cal-Tex a few
months and has shown himself to be hot~headed with a bad
temper, having challenged some of the salesmen to a fight

and, in fact, challenged SMITH also. SMITH advised that he
was not always cooperative, that he resented being reprimanded,
was often late on the submission of his reports and careless
as to the contents of the reports when submitted. SMITH
advised that FAHEY is slow in that he does not grasp the

facts of a situation quickly.

On July 16, 1968, Captain HUGH BROWN, Los Angeles
Police Department, advised that members of his department do
not anticipate further contact with JOHN FAHEY since they
consider him to be unreliable.

FAREY first came to their attention when he was
introduced by one FERNANDO FAURA, a reporter for the Citizens
News in Hollywood; for a San Fernando Valley Newspaper; and
a reporter doing free-lance work for Life and Time, Inc.
BROWN explained that FAURA has continuously attempted to
introduce other individuals to the police department whom
he alleges have knowledge of the KENNEDY assassination.

Those individuals interviewed by the police department have
proven to have no knowledge of the KENNEDY shooting.

Captain BROWN further explained there is no

jatention on the part of his department to subject FAHEY to
a polygraph examination.

that she had received two telephone calls from New York

identified himself as JOHN LAWRENCE, Executive Secretary of
the "Clemency Committee for Sirhan Sirhan",

According to Miss NAVARRO, he stated that Los
Angeles criminal attorneys are "crooks" and will take SIRHAN
"down the river", He said, "We are out to get Mr. PARSONS,
We are going to get you", “He stated that Mr. PARSONS is
being paid $150,000 to represent SIRHAN, and that there are
250,000 Arabs who are very militant and would not let Mr,
PARSONS get away with it, He repeated himself during the
conversation, Miss NAVARRO described his talk and voice as
sounding upset and high strung.

A source who has furnished reliable information in
the past advised on June 21, 1968, that JOHN M, LAWRENCE,
Chairman, Federated Americans Against Israeli Racism (FAIR),
57 West Tenth Street, New York, New York, during early
June 1968, offered SIRHAN SIRHAN any assistance he desired,
indicating he and his organization would commence a campaign
to seek mercy for SIRHAN, Source further advised that FAIR is
self-described in its literature as dedicated to the highest
tradition of American democracy and working for a united and
progressive Arab nation and the restoration of Palestine to
the Arab people,

LAWRENCE and his wife, MARJORIE M, LAWRENCE, are

Mrs. OLGA BELL, 849 Nottingham Drive, Redlands,
California, wife of the Reverend IVAN B. BELL, advised that
she is a sister of JOHN LAWRENCE PAWLUK. She said that he
uses the name of JOHN LAWRENCE exclusively and resides at
57 West 1Oth Street, Apartment 3-C, in New York City. She
said that he is a graduate of John Garfield High School in
Los Angeles, and to the best of her knowledge, never went
beyond that in school. Except for one very brief visit in
a car in front of her home several years ago, Mrs. BELL
said she has not seen her brother, JOHN LAWRENCE, since she
visited him in New York City in 1952.

Mrs. BELL said she is not fond of her brother and
that he seemed over the years to contact her only to tell her
that he was in trouble. Mrs.°BELL indicated that she did
not care to document her knowledge or association of her
brother very positively, She said that she wanted to avoid
any reference to him in her thinking because he had generally
been argumentative and had been opposed to any respect for
the Christian religion. She pointed out that since her
husband is a Baptist Minister in Redlands, JOHN LAWRENCE
had called her husband about one month ago and talked to her
husband briefly since he’ read about SIRHAN SIRHAN having
worshipped in a Baptist Church. In view of this, JOHN
LAWRENCE thought it would be appropriate if the Reverend BELL
would contact a fellow Baptist minister of the Reverend's own
choosing and urge that minister, preferably from the Pasadena,
California, area, to establish_contact with SIRHAN SIRHAN,
The Reverend BELL did not comply with the request.

In early 1968, the Reverend BELL had been in New
York and had a brief visit with JOHN LAWRENCE, At that time
LAWRENCE gave the Reverend BELL a book written by- SAMI HADAWI

entitled "Bitter Harvest" (Palestine 1914 - 1967), published
by the New World Press.

Mrs. BELL said that her husband had read from
the book but had not commented about its contents. She
said it favored the Arab view point in its struggle with
Israel. She added that she felt as if she hdd disowned JOHN
LAWRENCE and did not wish to be contacted by him. She
said he was aware of her feelings.

In further recollection, she said that he was
born in December 1921, in Ft. Worth, Texas, and has
occasionally called saying he had been arrested, but
she did not know where. She thought it was probably in
Colorado and in New York City. She said also that he was
to have had some psychiatric examination in Denver,
Colorado, at the time of a court appearance there. She
said further, that his general feelings have been opposing
big business and government, but she did not know of any
reference indicating violence in his feelings. .

She said that it seemed strange to her that in 1966 he
married a Jewish girl whose first name was MARJORIE, and
who was from New York City. Mrs. BELL said she has never
seen JOHN's wife and knows nothing about her except that
in telephone comments JOHN LAWRENCE indicated that his wife
was now also pro-Arab in her political views. They have

no children.

Regarding employment, she stated she did not know
where he was employed but that he usually obtained employ-
ment in researching public court records for attorneys,
put to the best of her knowledge, he never had any formal
legal training himself.

ALEX P, PAWLUK was interviewed at his place of
employment, Marquardt Industrial Products, 9271 Arrow
Highway, and advised that he is the brother of JOHN M,
LAWRENCE, also known as John Lawrence Pawluk. He said that
he is a retired Air Force Warrant Officer. He advised as
follows:

His brother has been living in New York City for
about four years, and he assumes his brother has changed
his name legally to JOHN M. LAWRENCE, His brother attended
college in the Los Angeles area for several years, place
not known, but did not graduate. His brother has a brilliant
mind and has a law background, achieved through self study
of the law, and is considered as competent as an attorney
but has no degree nor license. He often works as a legal
secretary or researcher. His brother always had a concern
for the "underdog" and has been a crusader of causes. He
often tests the constitutionality of laws and therefore
often runs afoul of the law. He has had numerous arrests
for misdemeanors but has no prison record.

He said an outstanding example of one of his
brother's crusades occurred in about 1964 in Colorado when
he fought against a local tax on a water project. As a
result, the State of Colorado had him committed to a mental
institution, where he remained for several months. Mr. PAWLUK
said, when he learned his brother was in custody, he arranged
for his release, and they returned together to Pomona,
California. : :

His brother stayed four to six months with him in
Pomona, and he said he observed that his brother was not
insane. His brother worked at some legal office locally,
put after a few months, he returned to New York City.

He said his brother is not a violent man. He
recalled having a heated argument with him several years ago

and his brother told him that he was opposed to violence
and would never get into a physical fight over an issue.

He said, if his brother is anti-Israel, he is no
doubt supporting the "underdog" and that this conviction
is contrary to his family background, as his family was
raised in the Baptist church, where his father is a minister.

He said he knew nothing of an organization named
Federated Americans Against Israeli Racism and did not know
of any of his brother's organizational affiliations.

Concerning the question of funds, he said his
brother is always soliciting money for his pet projects
from anybody who will donate.

He recalled that his brother's wife stelephoned ,him
about six months ago saying that his brother was in local
custody at Danbury, Connecticut, and she asked for money.

He added there is no reason to believe his brother
had any connection with SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

: 3. Examining Physician's Report, under name of
JOHN LAWRENCE PAWLUK. This report is dated March 24, 1949
and reflects PAWLUK was admitted to the San Diego County
Hospital on March 14, 1949, Report states:

"This 27 yr old white male was admitted to the
hospital at request of the Police officer with history that
he had been arrested on February 28 for vagrancy and on
charge of disturbing the peace. Since being in the jail he
had become quite a problem, constantly questiming the
legality of his arrest. He demanded that..he be given six
hours @ week in the County Law Library in order to prepare
his case, as ne was defending himself, He then went on a
hunger strike on March 11 and becéuse of his persistence in
not eating, he was transferred to the psychopathic ward.

Soon after arriving here, the patient began eating, stating

there w@és no use trying to fight a stomach tube. Overtly,
has been in good contact and has mingled with the other
patients. Tends to be rather aggressive; he télls his story
freely; however, his speech is circumstantial, rambling and

. at times even evasive. He stated that he has been arrested

on six occasions, first in 1942 for lost draft card. Last
time in January of 1949, was in Los Angeles for drunkenness.
He feels that the police over-stepped their authority and he
says that his ambition and work is to stop this police
rousting. Basically, this individual is eccentric and
constitutes that segment of population ordinarily termed as
the Chronic Non-~conformist. He is querulent and he has

‘consecrated his life to fighting the injustices that are

meted out by the Gestapo Police department in this fair
state of ours. This man actually goes about with a so~called
"chip on his shoulder", apparently hoping someone will

knock it off, which will merely indicate his own hostile

attitude towards a particular segment of society. This

man must constantly seek @ justifiable grievance as a pro-
tection against his own feeling of inadequacy. Basically,

patient is not psychotic, but is, however, border line.

_. FILIBERTO RIVERO, Publisher of the semimonthly Spanish
language newspaper, "La Prensa de Los Angeles", 822 North Van
Ness, Los Angeles, California, telephonically advised that he
had learned the following from ALBERTO VELASCO, a Cuban barber
vesiding at 1409 North Edgemont Street, Los Angeles, California:

VELASCO and several other local anti-Castro and anti-
communist Cubans, including JOSE ANTONIO DUARTE, their leader
(who resides at Apartment 15, 6643 De Longpre Avenue, Los
Angeles, California’;attended a meeting in a private residence
at an unknown address in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles,
California about five weeks ago. The meeting sponsored by an
unidentified but apparently American pro-communist organization,
was open to the public and featured an American student tho al-~-
lerediy had recently been to Cuba. The student explained to
those present how favorable conditions are in Cuba.and exhibited
photographs supposedly taken there to illustrate progress under
the Castro regime. DUARTE personally confronted the student
claiming both his remarks and photographs were "phony" and pre-
sented a false picture. This caused a young man present, be-
lieved by DUARTE and the others to closely resemble, if not
actually be,SIRHAN SIRHAN, to vehemently defend the’student and
the Castro regime against DURATE's statements.

DUARTE made,or was to have made,a full statement of
the above incident to the Los Angeles Police Department on
June 6, 1968.

Major JOSE A, DUARTE, true name Jose Antonio Duarte-
Oropesa, 66423 De Longpre Avenue, Hollywood, California, residence
telephone 469-0823, advised that he is the spokesman for UNARE
(Unidad Nacional Revolucionaria) a Cuban exile organization with
mailing address of Post Office Box 802, Hollywood, Californie.

DUARTE advised that he is a former major in FIDEL
CASTRO's rebel army, but is presently. the leader of UNARE, an
anti-CASTRO underground movement organized by him and aimed at
the restoration of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. DUARTE claims
to be an avowed anti-communist, anti-fascist, anti-imperialist
fighter and believes that violence can only be combated by the
use of violence.

DUARTE stated he had been arrested.:-> indicted
and sent to prison in New York for violating the Neutrality Act
in 1952. Following his release he left for Mexico and
subsequently returned to Cuba, clandestinely, in mid 1954.
In 1956 DUARTE joined the forces of FIDEL CASTRO, whom he had
met while attending the University of Havana in 1946, in
planning a new uprising in Cuba to overthrow FULGENCIO
BATISTA's regime. DUARTE continued his association with
CASTRO obtaining the rank of major, the highest in the rebel
army, until he became aware of communist infiltration of the
government and disgusted with the anti-American campaign
promulgated by CASTRO, In 1960, DUARTE's connections with
the CASTRO regime were abruptly severed and in the follow:zng
six years he was subjected to numerous arrests, prison terms
and a death sentence which wes later commuted. It wags during
this time that DUARTE was able to organize the underground
movement UNARE. After unsuccessful attempts to get out of
Cuba by means of passports to Mexico and Brazil, DUARTE
managed to enter the United States on September 6, 1966 under
the provisions of a treaty negotiated by the Swiss
Government allowing Cubans>,eligible for American citizenship,

to travel to the j States. DUARTE i= Cuban

DUARTE advised he visited California for two weeks
in November 1966 and took up permanent residence in Los Angeles,
California in May 1967. Since this time DUARTE has been
involved in writing a history of Cuba, giving lectures at
various colleges and universities, as well as civic organizations.
In connection with activities as leader of UNARE, DUARTE
advised he and his followers have made it a point to attend
any pro-communist meetings or demonstrations, especially those
involving Cuba.

DUARTE advised that on May 14, 1968, he and his
followers attended a pro-communist meeting at a residence
located in Griffith Park, at 3800 Amesbury Road, Los Angeles,
California, DUARTE stated that they had learned of this
meeting through a leaflct advertising that a lecture and
showing of slides concerning Cuba would be given by PAUL
(last name unknown). He stated PAUL, whom he believes was
from San Francisco State College, has recently returned from
a tour of Cuba with a student group.

Upon arriving at 3800 Amesbury Road, DUARTE observed
the meeting wag to be held in a large mansion, located at the
top of a hill and in 2 secluded area. DUARTE stated the
meeting was held in a room filled with chairs and on the wall
of this room was hanging a large picture of the Cuban
Revolutionary, CHE GUEVARA. He estimated the meeting was
attended by.55 persons, about twelve of whom were his followers
DUARTE stated the meeting appeared to have been organized by
a woman, who he later determined was from Colombia, South.
America and was possibly the wife of the owner of the house.

According to DUARTE, he and his followers arrived at
approximately 9:00 p.m. and shortly thereafter, PAUL, the guest
speaker, arrived. At the beginning of the meeting, DUARTE got
up and demanded he be given equal time and the right to present
hig views on thr Cuban situation. He said this demand caused

—~ 839 -

considerable commotion and it was agreed upon to take a vote
to determine if he, DUARTE, should be allowed to speak. A
vote was taken and turned out to be 28 to 27 in favor of
allowing DUARTE to speak. DUARTE stated that at that time
he had agreed to lect PAUL deliver his lecture before
presenting his own views. After PAUL had spoken a short
while, the lights were turned down in order for PAUL to show
the slides. At this time, DUARTE anticipating the meeting
would be adjourned following the showing of the slides, got
up from his seat and began to demand the right to speak.

At that time, DUARTE first noticed an individual,whom he
described es white, male, in his mid 20's, dark or swarthy
complexion, short in stature and very casually attired,weering a
T-shirt and trousers. DUARTE said this individual was

slight in build, and his intitial impression was that he

was possibly a jockey. This individual began shouting and
making derogatory remarks toward him and accused him, DUARTE,
of being a CIA Agent and asked how much he was being paid

by tne CIA. DUSRTE said he confronted this individual, who
claimed to be an Arab, in an effort to resolve the situation
peaceably . He said he was unable to do so inasmuch as

this individual became quite violent, frenzied and displayed
a very militant attitude toward him. DUARTE stated ne

then became involved in a brief scuffle with this individual
and they decided to mect outside following the meeting to
settle their differences. Shortly thereafter, the meeting
was adjourned as a result of the turmoil and confusion
created by DUARTE's attempts to present his views. Following
the above incident, this individual left the meeting and DUARTE
never saw him again.

DUARTE positively identified @ photograph of
SIRHAN BISHARS SIRHAN, dated June 5, 1963, Los Angeles Police
Department Booking No. 495139 as being identical with the
above described individual. DUARTE advised that upon secing
SIRHSN's photograpn in a local newspaper, he immediately
recognized him and had thereafter gone to the Rampart
Division of the Los Angeles Police Departm nt and voluntarily
furnished a statement regarding his knowledge of SIRHAN,

by anyone. He said he noticed SITRHAN had been seated at she
meeting beside an unknown male Negro, approximately 25 years
oi age and an unknown white male, approximately 40 years of
age, who he believes was of Greek descent. Both of these two
individuals also were sloppily dressed and gave the appearances
of being hippies.

DUARTE advised that at no time during the meeting,
or his confrontation with SIRHAN ,did he hear SIRHAN make any
remarks or statements in reference to Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY or a possible assassination attempt on KENNEDY or
any other political figure.

DUART= stated that following the meeting, a collection
was taken up by the organizers of the meeting to obtain funds
to assist in the legal defense of an individual named NEWTON,
who. he, DUARTE, believes is charged with the murder of a
policeman in Oakland, California.

DUARTE advised that, although he does not know the’ |
names or identities of any individuals attending the meet:.ng,
other than his own followers, he would be able to
identify those individuals who appeared to be with SIRHAN and
witnessed the altercation between them, should he see thes arein.

owner of the house. BARCO advised that he heard this
individual agkwd RAQUEL if she was from Cuba. She answered,
"No", and stated that she was from Colombia, South America.
BARCO stated that this individual then asked RAQUEL if she
had any connections with guerrilla groups in Colombia, to
which she also answered, "No". BARCO went on to say that
it appeared from their conversation that RAQUEL and this
individual had not known each other before this meeting.

BARCO positively identified a photograph of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN dated June 5, 1968, Los Angeles Police

RAQUEL. BARCO believes that SIRHAN was already at the

arrived.

BARCO advised that the meeting then began and PAUL
started talking about his recent trip to Cuba.

At this time, DUARTE got up and demanded that he
be given equal time to present his views on the Cuban
situation. This request caused a little commotion and it
was then put to a vote whether DUARTE should be allowed to
speak, The vote turned out 28 to 27 in favor of DUARTE
speaking. BARCO advised that DUARTE then agreed to let
PAUL deliver his talk and show his slides first. After
PAUL had spoken about his trip, he then showed slides taken
in Cuba and delivered a short monologue with each slide.

Following the showing of the slides, DUARTE got
up and began to speak, denying most of what PAUL had previously

He was born January 21, 1945, at Guantanamo,

ALBERTO VELAZCO, Approximately four weeks ago, DUARTE,
VELAZCO, HURTADO, and seven or eight other Cuban individuals
attended a meeting at a private residence in Griffith Park
in Los Angeles. HURTADO recalled that several days prior

to tne meeting, VELAZCO told him that DUARTE and others
planned to attend a pro-CASTRO meeting, and asked him to
accompany them to this meeting. He believes that VELAZCO
had a leaflet announcing this meeting, and that this leaflet
indicated that the meeting was sponsored by the Freedom
Party. HURTADO accompanied DUARTE, VELAZCO, one FRANK
MARTINEZ, ALBERTO BARCO, FRANKLIN DENIS, AMBROSIO REYES,
ESTABEN FERNANDEZ, and an individual known to him as OVIDIO

the room and a large adjoining hallway. HURTADO and four
or five others in his group remained in the rear of the
room, while DUARTE and several others from their group sat
toward the front of the room.

The meeting started at approximately 9:00 p.m.,
with the introduction of the speaker, a white male individual,
approximately 25 years of age, who was introduced as PAUL,
last name not mentioned, and as having recently returned
from a trip to Cuba. HURTADO believes that PAUL (LNU)
mentioned that he was from the Students for a Democratic
Society.

After PAUL (LNU) was introduced, DUARTE stood up
and requested that he be given time to present his views on
Cuba, A noisy discussion,as to whether DUARTE should be
allowed to speak,followed, and HURTADO believes that at this
time DUARTE was given permission to speak after PAUL (LNU)

resented his taik on Cuba. PAUL (LNU) spoke for approximately

O minutes, discussing the Cuban revolution and what CASTRO
had accomplished for Cuba in terms of housing and employment.
Following this talk, PAUL (LNU) began showing his slides on
Cuba. HURTADO believes that sometime during this slide
presentation, DUARTE again stood up and demanded time to
present his views on Cuba and refute statements made by

PAUL (LNU). The audience again became noisy, and it was
decided that DUARTE would have to wait until the slide
presentation was completed.

Following the slide presentation, DUARTE stood up
and attempted to speak, Between 15 and 20 persons left the
meeting at this point. HURTADO noted that as DUARTE started
to speak some of the individuals seated toward the front of
the room became quite noisy and shouted at DUARTE. Although
he did not dlosely observe any of these individuals, HURTADO
recalls one elderly lady shouted several times that DUARTE
was a liar. HURTADO also recalls observing a short, dark
complected individual, wearing a white T-shirt, who accused
DUARTE of being a CIA Agent. He further described this
individual as approximately 5'6", slender build, and having
medium length curly hair. HURTADO does not recall any specific

TA 56-156

comments made by this latter individual other than the
accusation that DUARTE was a CIA Agent, He did not see or
hear anything which would indicate that this individual was
of Arab extraction. HURTADO believes this individual left
the meeting with four companions but was unable to describe
these other individuals.

According to HURTADO, as DUARTE began to speak,
those sitting in the front of the room became so noisy
that the meeting had to be adjourned a short while later.

HURTADO was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, including a June 5, 1963, Los Angeles Police
Department mug photograph and a profile photograph of this
individual, After viewing these photographs, HURTADO stated
that he did not get a good enough look at the above individual
to say whether he resembled the photographs of SIRHAN. He
cannot recall observing anyone else at the meeting who
resembled these photographs.

UNARE (Unidad Nacional Revolucionaria), for about eight
years, MARTINEZ stated that UNARE is a Cuban exile organization,

and DUARTE had gone to this location, arriving at approximately
9:00 PM, and meeting with the other members of their group

requested that he be given the right to speak in order to
present his views on the Cuban situation, MARTINEZ said
that most of the people in attendance appeared to be
reluctant about letting DUARTE speak, but it was suggested
by someone that a vote be taken to determine whether or not
he could speak, MARTINEZ said the vote was close, but

that DUARTE won the right to speak. DUARTE agreed, however,
to wait until PAUL had completed his presentation before

he would speak.

MARTINEZ advised that PAUL told his audience
he had personally met with FIDEL CASTRO while in Cuba and
that CASTRO was considered a great man by the Cuban people.
PAUL also indicated that he had gone to Cuba by taking a
flight from Mexico and then returning to Mexico.

MARTINEZ related that in addition to his lecture,
PAUL showed several colored slides taken in Cuba and gave
a short description concerning each slide. MARTINEZ said
that one slide in particular, which showed a monument
erected at the site of the Bay of Pigs invasion, had caused
many of his fellow Cubans to become quite excited. He said
that PAUL referred to the invasion as having been undertaken
by "mercenaries", MARTINEZ said that one of his group, a
friend of DUARTE named PEREIRA, who was a veteran of the
Bay of Pigs invasion, had immediately gotten up and stated
that the invasion was not undertaken by mercenaries but
rather by "Cuban patriots",

After PAUL had finished showing his slides,
DUARTE got up from his front row seat, and stated that he
now wanted to tell everyone the truth about communism,
FIDEL CASTRO and the present Cuban Government. At this
time, many people got up from their seats and began leaving
the room or gathering in small groups about the room talking
with one another. Most of the people appeared to be ignoring
DUARTE, but one group had begun to gather around him to
listen to what he had to say. MARTINEZ advised that he had
gone to the front of the room to stand by DUARTE, fearing
that some of the people in attendance at the meeting might

become violent in their objection to what he had to say.
MARTINEZ said that while standing directly beside DUARTE,

he observed ean individual, who had also been seated in the
front row to DUARTE's right, approach DUARTE with two or
three other individuals, He described this first individual
as a white male in his mid 20's, very short, about 5'5",
dark complected, with curly black hair, MARTINEZ said he
first appeared to be of Mexican descent and was wearing
trousers and a tee shirt.

MARTINEZ continued that upon approaching DUARTE,
this individual began making remarks towards DUARTE that
what he was saying was lies and that he, DUARTE, should
stop speaking. DUARTE replied to this individual that if
he continued his interruptions, he, DUARTE, would consider
this as a personal insult and it would be necessary for
them to meet outside and settle their differences. DUARTE
then continued talking but this individual again interrupted
DUARTE and asked DUARTE, "Let me see your hands". This
‘individual then accused DUARTE of being paid by the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to attend the meeting and asked
DUARTE, "How much the CIA paying you?" At this time, DUARTE
asked this individual where he came from and the individual
replied, "I am an Arab", DUARTE then asked this individual
if he was one of NASSER's men and the individual replied,
"No, I'm a revolutionary".

MARTINEZ said he was unable to recall any: other
exchange of words between DUARTE and this individual and
said that during the confrontation, this individual had
become quite excited and violent and that his friends had
subsequently physically restrained him and removed him from
the room, MARTINEZ said he did not see this individual
again that evening. MARTINEZ was unable to describe this
individual's friends but said he might possibly recognize
them if he were to see them again.

MARTINEZ advised that shortly after this incident,
the meeting broke up and he and his group left the residence.
