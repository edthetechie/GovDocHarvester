Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was as-

In both cases suspects have been

The trial of the alleged assassin of
Kennedy was scheduled to start Nov.

say it may now he delayed until next
year.

There are many things wrong with
our system of criminal jurisprudence.
.Court calendars are clogged; men
who. should not be are freed on bail
to repeat their offenses; judges take
‘long vacations when they should
work six days a week; defense law-
yers milk out of lenient laws and
lenient courts every last minute, or

month or year of delay that they can;
Supreme Court decisions give unusual
benefits to defendants.

There miust be due process; the
rights of every person accused of

But due process can be provided
and protected and justice can be as-
sured while at the same time suspects
are given speedy trials.

Until there is quick and sure re-
lationship between crime and punish-
ment we are going to have more and
more crime.

Courts and the bar, both having
the responsibility, should know that
justice—justice to the defendant and
justice to society—demands that all
criminal cases. especially cases like

the King and Kennedy murder cases .

should not be interminably delayed

JUNE 5, 1968

On October 10, 1968, a young female telephonically
contacted the Jackson Office of the FBI and identified
herself as Miss Subrina Duble, white female, age 17. She
refused to give her home address or telephone number but
stated the nature of her call was to furnish the FBI with
important information concerning the assassination of
Robert F, Kennedy, Miss Duble related a very rambling
episode of how she had met an individual in California
whom she had cause to believe was involved in the
assassination of Senator Robert F, Kennedy, She stated she has
had knowledge of this since May, 1968, but declined to
report this information due to threatening phone calls
and letters warning her to keep anything she might know to
herself.

She stated she is a resident of Alabama but did not
wish to be contacted at home due to her father's condition,
as she is afraid that any upsetting incident might cause
him to have another stroke, She did state, however, that
she could be reached at telephone number 762-9920, a pay
phone in Pascagoula, Mississippi, anytime between 9:00
and 11:00 p.m, any night.

" During this call she seemed very emotional and
upset over something that had happened just prior to the
call and she seemed out of breath and either crying
or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, ,

wanted to drop the matter and did not want to meet with an
Agent, She persistently declined to further identify herself
or to agree to meet the Agent, She finally did agree to call
him again after she had spoken to her father. Throughout
the conversation with her, her conversation appeared to be ranting

female. GIBSON advised that PITTS was using telephone number
762-9920 located at Larry's Standard Service, Highway 90,
Pascagoula, at the time he was arrested. GIBSON said he noted
this was_the same telephone used by an individual using the

these calls and is satisfied that he was the one who made the

it on interview. He said he did admit making the calls to

the young white boys impersonating the young white girls.

GIBSON said that PITTS' mother, who is an intelligent
and respected Negro in the community and who works for the
Police Department as a crossing guard, told him that her son
had in his possession recently literature from the FBI concerning
employment opportunities, bearing the FBI phone number at Jackson.

Since there is nothing to indicate that PITTS has any
