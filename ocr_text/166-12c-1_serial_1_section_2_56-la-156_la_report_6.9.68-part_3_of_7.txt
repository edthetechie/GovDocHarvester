"I am employed as a waiter at the Ambassador

at the hotel to observe Senator Robert Kennedy's
victory speech. I arrived at the Ambassador Hotel
after leaving my home at approx. 11:35 pm and went
to the Ambassador Room which is below the Embassy
Room. I then left the Ambassador Room and went upstairs
to the kitchen via back stairs to avoid hotel security
guards. I arrived in the kitchen and then went to
the pantry area. My reason for doing this was to
shake hands with Senator Kennedy. Shortly after
this Senator Kennedy entered this room and then exited
to the Embassy Room. As he went out the door to the
Embassy Room Senator Kennedy shook hands with me and
then went out into the Embassy Room. As I entered in
this small room I was challenged by a hotel security
guard but Martin Patrusky, a hotel employee, told him
I worked for the hotel.

"I remained by the door leading to the Embassy
Room and shortly thereafter, Eddie Manasian, another
hotel employee, told me that Senator Kennedy was
finished his speech and that he was going to the
Colonial Room for a press conference and that I was to
make an eisle for him. Senator Kennedy, after his
speech, then left the stage in the Embassy Room and
went through a door at the rear of the stage. He
then turned to his right, walked down a ramp and was
then in the same room as I was. As Senator Kennedy
walked through this room I began walking nex
(approx. 3 feet) to him. Senator KENNEDY walked through
the swinging door on the left side and I went through
the swinging door on the right side, At this time we
were both (Senator Kennedy and I) in the kitchen.

"There were approx. 40-50 people were in this
pantry room including hotel employees and spectators.
I was walking next to Senator Kennedy wh:le in the
pantry area and at that time another unknown individual
walked between myself and Senator Kennedy. At that
time I was then walking approx, 5 feet away and
slightly behind Senator Kennedy.

"I was stopped at the ice machine when Senator
Kennedy stopped, shook hands with Martin Patrusky,
turned and shook my hand as I was standing on the
Senator's right, then turned to his left and went to
shake hands with a busboy. Senator Kennedy then
moved tc his right and toward the heating cabinets to
shake hands with a hotel cook and a female Caucasian
standing next to the cook. At this time I stopped to
observe Senator Kennedy as did the others in the room.

“prior to this occurence and the time that Senator
Kennedy shook my hand I observed a white male and a
white female standing on a tray holder at the opposite
end of the ice machine which is approx. 12 - 15 feet
away. This white male turned toward the white female

"end appeared to converse with her very briefly. He
then dismounted from the tray holder went into the
erowd and I did not observe him until shortly
thereafter when I then saw him standing at the heating
cabinet behind Mr. Karl Uecker, another hotel employee.
I did not see this white female again after this time.

"As Senator Kennedy shook the hand of the hotel
cook he then turned to his right in the direction of
the heating cabinet and at that t.me I saw the
white male who was previously standing on the tray
holder now standing behind Mr. Uecker at the heating
cabinet. I saw this individual reach his right
arm around Mr. Uecker and in his hand he had a
revolver which was pointed directly at Senator
Kennedy's head. The revolver was about 3 - 5 feet
from Senator Kennedy's head. This individual then
snot Senator Kennedy in the head. Senator Kennedy
at this time threw his hands and arms up, re led
backwards and fell to the floor. During this period
of time and after the first shot was fired I heard
3 more rapidly fired shots.

"At this time the individual standing nexte
to ms on my left fell into my arms and I saw that he
had been shot in the forehead. I eased this person
to the floor, then went to the aid oi Senator
Kennedy who was on the floor and being helped by
the bus boy. Senator Kennedy was dazed and said
"Is everybody allright?" Senator Kennedy said
"It allright" then mumbled something else.

"T then observed the individual who shot
Senator Kennedy being subdued by Rafer Johnson,
Karl Uecker and Roosevelt Grier. I saw someone

and entered the stage.

"I was in the kitchen serving area at the
time and saw him as he went to the Embassy Room
stage.

"I stayed in the kitchen serving area watching
the speech of Senator Kennedy on a TV monitor.

"In about 15 or 20 minutes Senator Kennedy
and a group of people came through the door from
the Embassy Room to the kitchen serving area.
Karl Ucker, Assistant Maitre D' Hotel had Senator
Kennedys left sleeve in his hand and Ucker was
attempting to lead Senator Kennedy through the

said "'Thank you'. Senator Kennedy then turned to
his right and shook hands with Vincent Di Pierro,

a fellow waiter. Senator Kennedy then turned to
his left and shook hands with a chef and a bus-boy,
Juan Romero.

"After Senator Kennedy shook hands with Juan
Romero I noticed a man pushing his way toward Senator
Kennedy and Karl Ucker. I thought this man was
going to shake hands with Senator Kennedy. He
pushed himself around to the right of Ucker. This
man leaned around the left side of Uckers body and
extended his hand toward Senator Kennedy. I do not
know if this man extended his left or right hand. I
immediately heard a sound like that of a firecracker.

"T saw Senator Kennedy falling backwards.
I looked across the serving room and saw a man
falling back against Vincent Di Pierro and blood
appeared on the eye glasses of Di Pierro. I also
saw a man standing next to Senator Kennedy grab
his stomach and fall backward.

"T saw a group of men grabbing a man who was
lying face down on the steam table in the serving
room. The muzzle of a gun was extending beyond
the group and the gun was being waved around before
some one grabbed it from the man.

"T then saw Senator Kennedy lying on the
floor and a pool of blood was forming under his
head. I was then pushed back by the crowd into
the cooks eating area. I assisted Mr. Angelo, the
Maitre D' to close off the kitchen area part with
wooden benches.

"While Senator Kennedy was speaking in the
Embassy Room I was in the serving area and at that
time there were about twenty persons in the serving
area. About half of these persons were hotel
employees and about half were outsiders. As I
have mentioned the serving room is just east of
the Embassy Room stage.

"While Senator Kennedy was speaking I noticed
a man standing on a rack full of trays in the
serving area. This tray rack has wheels and is
raised about six inches off the floor.

"This man was standing on the tray holding on
to it to maintain his position on the rack as it
was full of trays. This man was looking from the

. Mr. STANLEY KAWALEC, Security Officer, Ambassador
Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California,
advised that he was assigned as a guard at the hotel
the night of June 4, 1968. KAWALEC advised that his station
was in a hallway which is located directly behind a small
anteroom: which, in turn, is located directly behind the
stage in the Embassy Room. It was on this stage that
Senator KENNEDY was making his victory speech. The stage
was separated from the anteroom-by a closed curtain. The
anteroom was occupied by musicians who had been playing
intermittently during the evening and who assumed that
location during Senator KENNEDY's speech.

Mr. KAWALEC stated that his main function was to
keep the crowd which had gathered in the hallway ott’ of the
anteroom and in turn away from the curtain and stage area.
KAWALEC stated that the hallway was very crowded but he
observed no unusual activity in his area except that on one
occasion, one of the band members in the anteroom came to
him during the speech and claimed three “outsiders" were
in the anteroom with him. KAWALEC advised that he ordered
the three men cut of the room and that they joined the main
crowd in the hallway. KAWALEC was definite in saying that
none of these men resembled the suspect, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

KAWALEC advised that as Senator KENNEDY was
completing his speech, he was ordered by the Chief Security
Officer, Mr. WILLIAM GARDNER, to vacate the spot which he
had directly behind the stage and assume a position in the
Embassy kitchen area. The purpose of this station, according
to KAWALEC, was to control the crowd and make a passageway
for Senator KENNEDY from a side door of the Embassy Room
through the Embassy kitchen to the Colonial Room where the
Senator was to have a press conference. KAWALEC stated that
when the Senator reached the kitchen, KAWALEC was standing
at the end of a steam table, facing the Senator pushing the
crowd behind him when he heard four distinct shots from a

.22 caliber gun, which he sensed passed him to his right.
KAWALEC stated immediate confusion ensued and that he did
not see the Senator hit nor fall, concentrating on the
control of the crowd at that time. KAWALEC advised that

the next action he observed was ROOSEVELT GRIER wrestling
with an individual on the steam table. Having determined
that Senator KENNEDY had been shot and had fallen to the
floor, KAWALEC, together with two uniformed Los Angeles

Fire Department firemen, endeavored to keep the crowd back
from the Senator, allowing him air until assistance had
arrived. KAWALEC continued this activity until the

officers from the Central Receiving Hospital arrived with

a stretcher and eventually placed the stretcher on a freight
elevator leading to the ground level. KAWALEC stated that
he rode the freight elevator with the Receiving Hospital
officers and one of the guards, with perhaps two members

of the KENNEDY staff. On reaching the ground level, they
remained in the freight elevator until the ambulance Arfived
in the area. KAWALEC assisted in controlling the crowd near
the ambulance while the stretcher was being placed therein.

KAWALEC was questioned as to whether or not he
recalled having seen SIRHAN SIRHAN in the area of the kitchen
prior to the Senator entering it, to which he answered that
he did not have a distinct recollection but, having seen
photographs of him on television and in the press, believes
that he recalls seeing an individual with a hairdo similar
to SIRHAN's in the large crowd which had been behind the
stage and in the kitchen area.

Mr. KAWALEC was questioned as to whether or not
he had seen a girl in a polka dot dress in this area and
stated that there had been many girls in the crowd but he
recalls no one in a polka dot dress.

Mr, KAWALEC was questioned as to how he was able
to describe the caliber of the gun which had fired the four
shots he heard and he stated that he has a .22 caliber gun
of his own and that the resonance of the shots sounded
exactly like the shots he had fired from his own weapon.

Embassy Room, helping keep people from going through
the door that was close to the podium and which led
to the room behind the podium. At no time during the
evening did I see the man who has been identified as
Sirhan Sirhan.

"I stayed in the area of the podium while
Robert Kennedy made his victory speech. At that
time I did not know which way he planned to exit
after his speech, nor did anyone else that I know of.
About 5 minutes before Kennedy ended his speech, I
was told that Kennedy was going to exit through the
kitchen. I am not sure who the person wags that told
me that, but it may have been Jim Lowe, another
campaign worker.

“When Kennedy left the podium I was at the
corner of it, right in front of the Kennedy girls.
Irwin Stroll left right behind Kennedy, and then
some of the press and part of Kennedy's group
followed them. To the best of my recollection, I
was next after that. At about the time I reached the
door to the serving kitchen I heard some noises
which I thought to be helium balloonspopping or
flashbulbs. There were about 5 such noises,
Stroll came to me and said he had been shot, and
I helped him back into the Embassy Room. Soon
after that I left in a cab with Stroll for the
hospital.

"Apout 5 minutes before Kennedy went to
the podium, I walked through the serving kitchen
and it was empty. I may have glanced into the
kitchen at that time, but if so I did not take
particular note of the people I saw in the
kitchen, I think I would have noticed anyone in

ROBERT RAY BRESHEARS, 5709 Ewing Canyon, La
Canada, California, was interviewed at his place of employment,
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena,
California, and furnished the following information:

His wife, CAROL, has been a volunteer campaign
worker for the KENNEDY organization. He was with CAROL
at the Ambassador Hotel on the evening of June 4, 1968,
for the election party. He was in the Embassy Room of the
hotel, standing behind the stage, late in the evening watching
a television monitor as Senator KENNEDY was speaking. Toward
the end of the talk he walked to a position against the
west wall about ten to twelve feet from the double doors
leading to the kitchen area. When the speech had ended,
a large group of people, including JESSE UNRUH and presumably
Senator KENNEDY, came through the drapes in back of the stage
and walked past him. He did not see Senator KENNEDY but
just as the group passedinto the kitchen area through the
double doors, he heard four shots, the first shot sounding
like a balloon popping. After the second and third shots,
he was certain that the noise was gun shots, possibly from a
small barrel gun. The shots were in rapid succession and
sounded like they came from the same weapon. He did not
attempt to enter the kitchen area where the noise came from,
but shortly thereafter a news man came out of the area and
gave a brief account of what had happened.

People milled about the area and a short while later
they were all ushered, including himself, down the hall to the
downstairs ballroom. He stated hedid.not see SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN and has no knowledge of this individual. He recalled
that shortly before the KENNEDY party entered the double doors
leading to the kitchen area, several news and television people
were in the kitchen area working with cables and other television
equipment. He does not know the motive for the shooting.

Miss SUSANNE LOCKE, 6545 South Victoria Street,
Los Angeles, California, furnished the following information:

She was a volunteer worker for Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY during his campaign and wae attending the election re-
turns party in the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel on the
evening of June 4, 1968. While Senator KENNEDY was speaking,
she was stationed at a position near the rear of the stage on
the right side as one faces the stage, with a friend, ACQULINE
SULLIVAN, who had hurt her foot. It was late in the evening
and when Senator KENNEDY finished speaking, she and ACQULINE
had moved into the kitchen area where Senator KENNEDY was sub-
sequently shot. She and ACQULINE had stepped onto a shelf-like
ledge about four feet off the floor on the west side of the
kitchen area. Also present in this area at the time were about
four or five white jacketed hotel employees. As Senator KENNEDY
passed by with his party, he was surrounded by friends and
newspapermen. She turned to ACQULINE and commented about how
happy Mr. KENNEDY looked. After the KENNEDY party had passed,
she heard cracking noises which sounded like exploding fire-
erackerg. She immediately realized, however, that the sounds
were gunshot sounds and they were in rapid succession, a total
of about eight or ten shots. At this specific time, she had
lost sight of Senator KENNEDY. The gun sounds appeared to come
from her left and she immediately jumped to the floor. She does
not recall seeing anyone with a gun; and people immediately
began pushing into the kitchen area from the Embassy Room, ap-
parently attracted by.the noise and excitement. Her friend,
ACQULINE, was having difficulty trying to get to the floor and
she attempted to grab hold of her.

LOCKE noticed several men lying on the floor, one
with blood on his forehead--his eyes open and staring, but she
did not recognize any of these individuals on the floor as —
Senator KENNEDY. Another individual in her immediate vicinity,
a woman whom she did not know, had blood on her head and appeared
to be stumbling backwards. She was attempting to get help from
her friend ACQULINE but had lost sight of her and her other
thought was to attempt to reach the gunman who had done the

were pushing in ali directions and was headed back toward the
Embassy Room. Someone was apparently trying to close the double
doors leading to the Embassy Room, but she was successful in
getting out of the kitchen area and into a room behind the
stage. She sat down and someone gave her a cigarette.

She does not recall seeing Senator KENNEDY after the
shooting but believes that she may have seen SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN at the hotel earlier in the evening; however, she is not
sure of this. She recalls seeing a girl in the Embassy Room,
just before Senator KENNEDY entered to speak, stationed near
ner immediate vicinity wearing a white shift with blue polka
dots. She observed that the girl was not wearing a yellow press
badge and thought that this to be very unusual since it was
necessary to have such a badge to gain entry into the Embassy
Room. She mentioned this to CAROL BRESHEARS who is in charge
of the KENNEDY girls end Mrs. BRESHEARS pointed her out to a
guard nearby. The girl was expressionless and seemed somewhat
out of place where she was standing. She was a Caucasian in
her early twenties, well proportioned, with long brown hair
pulled back and tied behind her head. Her hair appeared to be
dried out similar in appearance to hair of a girl who does a
lot of swimming.

LOCKE is not acquainted with SIRHAN or his family and
hag no knowledge of any motive for shooting Senator KENNEDY.
She realizes that many people were opposed to Senator KENNEDY
as a presidential candidate, but does not consider this to be
unusual.

walked around the platform to the narrow space in the serving
area where the shooting took place and got there before KENNEDY.
Already present in this area were five people described as

(5) A white male, 6'1", tall, slim, darkish brown

These people were standing in a group between JOHNSON
and the door through which KENNEDY came to make his way to the
next ballroom for another speech. This is the same area where
he was shot.

JOHNSON states these people were standing in proximity
to each other; he says they were "together" but he states he
has no knowledge they knew each other, were talking to each
other or were members of the same party.

As the KENNEDY partyentered this area, balloons were
being broken, some small firecrackers were being set off and
JOHNSON was not aware of any difficulties or any trouble until
he saw a woman slump against the wall and say, "Oh my God,

Oh my God." JOHNSON still did not realize what had happened
but saw a furor around the KENNEDY party. At this time a
photographer with lights on his camera took a picture of someone
on the floor, who turned out to be KENNEDY. This photographer
then put the lights up to take a picture of the persons standing
and when his lights showed on SIRHAN, the photographer said,
"Grab him, that dude has a gun." This was the first time that
JOHNSON realized there had been a shooting.

Just at this point, the woman in the polka dot dress
and the three men in her area left and walked toward the ballroom
from where the KENNEDY party had just come. Several people
seized SIRHAN and began beating on him. The crowd pressed
around him and hit at him whenever they could. While SIRHAN
was being held and before police arrived, the girl in the
polka dot dress and the one man in the light blue washable sport
coat came back and looked, then both left again. JOHNSON
followed the persons who took SIRHAN out of this area and when

he got back to the ballroom, he saw the girl in the polka cot
dress talking to a white female Mexican near the podium where
KENNEDY had just been speaking. This white female Mexican
was 19 to 20 years of age, plump, 5'2"-5'5", long black hair,
full pleated dress, avecado color, part of the KENNEDY group;
JOHNSON assumed she was a Youth Campaign Manager.

JOHNSON did not see any of the others again and
did not see the girl in the polka dctdress again after seeing
her on the podium.

JOHNSON was shown a photograph by Sergeant JOHNSON
of a white female, CHERYL WESSELS, Los Angeles Police Department
DR 68-521466, and could not positively identify her as the
girl he saw in the polkadot dress, although he felt the profile
looked similar. DARNELL JOHNSON then said he believed he could

rather than using this door, the Senator departed the room by
using a doorway directly behind the speaker's rostrum. Shortly
after the Senator departed the doorway and was out of the view
of NBC personnel, it was noted that some activity was taking
place beyond the doorway. He and the other NBC personnel
rushed into the area and observed that the Senator was on the
floor of the corridor and was bleeding from the head. The
erew and the camera concentrated on the Senator. WATT does
not recall seeing the suspect who shot KENNEDY.

room. It was my understanding that when the Senator
finished his speech he was to come through the door
I was on and turn left down the hallway behind the stage.
As soon as the Senator finished his speech a superior
of mine, whom I don't recall, told me to close my door
and keep the people out. About a minute after the
senator finished his speech I heard about seven shots
all in a vow, all in about three seconds. The crowd
was starting to force there way through my door
before the shots and I was busy keeping them back and
did not see which way the Senator went after his speech
nor did I see the shooting or the suspect.

"When I heard the shots I turned toward the swinging
doors leading into the Pantry and saw a women bleeding
from the head. She was still standing at these swinging
doors and I:helped her back into the Embassy room and
a doctor, whom I don't know, aslted me to get some ice,
which I did. I did not go into the Pantry until about
fifteen minutes later and everything was over with in
there except the Los Angeles Police Officers were inter-
viewing people in there.

1 Date 6/7/68

“Mr. UNO TIMANSON, Vice President, Banquet and Sales,
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, was interviewed
at the hotel and furnished the following information:

Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY arrived back at the
Ambassador Hotel at approximately 8:00 p.m., on June 4, 1968,
and went immediately to the Royal Suite. At approximately
11:45 p.m., he instructed EDDIE MANASIAN, one of the assistant
maitre d's, to hold the north elevator so that Senator KENNEDY
could go down to the Embassy Room to make his victory statement.

He was escorting the Senatorto the elevator and when
they were only two or three feet from the elevator, the Senator
decided not to go through the crowds that were in the hallways
but to use the service elevator.

They took the service elevator to the kitchen level
and he, TIMANSON, led the way for the Senator into the Embassy
Room.

The Embassy Room was completely crowded at the time
and he, TIMANSON, was concerned that too many people might get
up on. the platform and. cause :.it.cto collapse.

After the Senator had completed his victory speech
in the Embassy Room, he was preparing to lead the Senator down
to the Ambassador Room through the enclosed stairway. Just
before the Senator's speech was completed, FRED DUTTON, one
of the Senator's aides, asked TIMANSON if there were television
sets in the Ambassador Room, and TIMANSON told him there were.
It was then decided that the Senator would visit the Press Room
to make a@ press release. TIMANSON escorted the Senator and his
party through the hallway behind the Embassy Room and into the
pantry area.

TIMANSON stated that he was approximately six feet
ahead of the Senator when he heard what sounded like a fire
eracker. He heard the sound three or four times in quick order
and_he thought it was some sort of celebration.

Immediately, however, TIMANSON observed that Senator
KENNEDY was down on the floor in front of the big ice machine
located in the pantry. At this time, there were numerous screams
and pandemonium broke out in the immediate area.

Mr. MURPHY, one of the hotel security guards, told
TIMANSON that he had called an ambulance but TIMANSON wanted to
make sure and he ran into the Colonial Room in an effort to contact
the operator but was unsuccessful. He was assured by the people
present that an ambulance had been called and was on the way.
Mr. TIMANSON stated that from the time of the shots to this time
when he was inguiring about an ambulance was just a matter of
seconds.

He ran immediately to the kitchen steps and took the
steps down to the Casino level and out to the back ramp to the
outside of the hotel to await the arrival of the ambulance. The
ambulance arrived in a very few minutes and he escorted the
ambulance attendants to the area where Senator KENNEDY was lying.

Senator KENNEDY was taken by the ambulance attendants
to the ambulance almost immediately. TIMANSON attempted to ride in
the ambulance but was not allowed. He rode on the back of a
motorcycle following the ambulance to the hospital.

Mr. TIMANSON advised that he did not see the actual
shooting of Senator KENNEDY and he did not observe the individual
holding the gun at the time of the shooting.

He did observe the individual who was being held down
by several people following the shooting of Senator KENNEDY and
has seen photographs in the newspapers and appearances on
television of the individual accused of the crime. The individual
he observed in the newspapers and on television is the same
individual he observed being held down following the shooting of
_ Senator KENNEDY.

"The Senator went out a door located immediately
behind the platform, turned right and walked down the
hallway to the pantry.

"As Senator Kennedy passed by me in the hallway
he was being escorted by Mr. UNO TIMANSON, a vice president
of the hotel, and two of my assistants, Karl UECKER
and Edward MINASTAN. Mr. UNO TIMANSON was leading the
way.

"As goon as Senator Kennedy passed, Mrs. Kennedy
came out into the hallway where I was standing. She
was being accompanied by Mr. Roosevelt Grier. Grier
was behind Mrs. Kennedy and to her left. I took a
Similar position to her right. We followed behind
the people following Senator Kennedy.

"Shortly after Senator Kennedy entered the pantry,
while we were still in the hallway, two shots rang out.
A few seconds later several shots rang out as in rapid
fire.

"At this time we were at the doorway to the pantry.
One door was opened (the left door) and a lady was
partialy blocking the door. I began to push the lady
out of the way to allow Mrs. Kennedy to pass. The lady
crumbled to the floor and I assumed she had been shot.
I immediately pushed Mrs. Kennedy to the floor behind
the closed door and I got down next to her. I did this
pecause I thought there might be more gunfire. However,
there was no more gunfire.

"T immediately got up and ran into the pantry and

LI noticed two men lying down on the floor and one of
them was Senator Kennedy.

"After a few minutes, approximately 8 minutes,
Senator Kennedy and the other wounded were taken out
of the hotel by ambulance attendants.

Mr. DI PIERRO began work at approximately 10:00 a.m.

DI PIERRO's duties require him to move throughout
the hotel during the day.

ne rooms assigned to Senator KENNEDY began filling
up with people at approximately 6:00 p.m. t first the people
were allowed in only if they had a badge for the particular
candidate. About 7:00 p.m. word was recéived to allow anyone
in that so desired. This was later revoked and only those
with proper press credentials were allowed into the rooms.
A security guard was stationed at the entrance to the Embassy
Ballroom and later in the evening a security guard was stationed
at the kitchen entrance. DI PIERRO could not recall the times
that these guards took up their specific stations. There was
aiso a security guard located inside the fire escape door on the
level which houses the Ambassador Room. There was no security
guard on the fire escape staircase that leads from the Ambassador
Room level to the imbassy Room level. He believes that the
fire escape door on the Embassy Room level was open the latter
part of the evening of June 4, 1968.

Senator KENNEDY was supposed to lcave the platform in
the tubassy Room and go into the hallway behind the lmbassy
Room and down an enclosed stairway to the Ambassador Room level
to speak to people in the Ambassador Room. Someone changed the
plans and decided that Senator KENNEDY would proceed to the
-Press Room to make a press release.

This route would require him to pass through the
pantry area of the hotel.

enter the Press Room, and he pushed his way in with this
individual.

He said the attention of people in the Press Room
was directed to the doorway leading to a kitchen access
hallway and at that time he saw uniformed policemen and
men dressed in plain clothes who may or may not have been
policemen, bringing a man forcefully out of this hallway
into the Press Room and whom he now believes looks like
the photographs he later saw of the suspect SIRHAN SIRHAN,

He stated that he then pushed his way through
that doorway from the Press Room into the kitchen access
hallway behind the Embassy Room, and there he saw Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY lying on the floor on his back being
attended by some unidentified people.

He stated that he took Mr. KENNEDY's pulse, which
he estimated was 130 beats per minute and did not
consider this to be critical and by the fact he was
being attended by someone, he left to attend to another
man, PAUL SCHRADE, who was lying on the floor closer
to the Press Room door and also checked his pulse.
SCHRADE's pulse was good, and he then examined the wound
high above the forehead in the hair line area at the
center of the head and checked the back of the head
to see if there was an exit wound and found none. He
stated that the blood on Mr. SCHRADE's face and wound was
clotting and bleeding had apparently stopped, so he
directed his attention back to Mr. KENNEDY.

He stated that he asked the man who was attending
Mr, KENNEDY if he was a physician and either that man or
someone else attending KENNEDY affirmed he was a physician,
and Doctor MILLER believing Mr. KENNEDY was ag well attended
as circumstances permitted, returned to Mr. SCHRADE,

He stated he does not know the identity of the
physician who was then attending Mr. KENNEDY and does |
not believe he could identify him if he should meet him
face to face because of the turmoil, excitemert , and the
fleeting seconds he was there.

He stated that a stretcher was brought in, upon
which Mr, KENNEDY was placed and removed from the kitchen.

access hallway, and he went back to Mr. SCHRADE and then
quickly looked at a young boy 18 or 19 years of age who
had a non-critical wound in the thigh and also a grown
man who was more critically wounded in the stomach, but
not in danger of expiring immediately. He said he then
went back to Mr, SCGHRADE and helped put him into a
stretcher, which had been brought in and accompanied him
in the ambulance to Central Receiving Hospital, where*yoon
arrival he directed an unknown doctor and nurses to the
immediate attention of Mr. SCHRADE's wound.

Doctor MILLER said he then went to Mr. KENNEDY's
room which was either adjoining Mr. SCHRADE'’s room or
next to a service room which did adjoin Mr. SCHRADE's
room and saw Senator KENNEDY being attended and noticed
that Mrs. KENNEDY was also there holding her husband
by the arm. He overheard hospital people discussing
whether or not to remove Mrs, KENNEDY, but a nurse
stated that she was not causing any disruption in his
treatment and permitted her to remain.

He said Mr. KENNEDY was placed in a4 respirator
and that he helped the other doctors administer Dextran
intravenously this being a blood replacement to keep
volume up until whole blood could be administered.
Albumen was also being administered along with the Dextran
fluid by insertion of a needle permitting the albumen
to flow into the same tubing by which the Dextran was
béing administered. He stated that the albumen needle
had come out of the:Dextran tubing whereupon he cleaned
this needle and replaced it into the Dextran tubing.

He stated that shortly thereafter he assisted

in lifting Senator KENNEDY into a stretcher as he was

being transferred to Good Samaritan Hospital and
continued assisting until he was placed into an ambulance
for this transfer.

He stated that he then returned to Mr. SCHRADE's
room and saw that he was being well attended, whereupon
he departed the hospital and upon coming out the front
entrance he saw numerous news men and asked for a ride
pack to the Ambassador Hotel and was invited to ride with
two unidentified men.
