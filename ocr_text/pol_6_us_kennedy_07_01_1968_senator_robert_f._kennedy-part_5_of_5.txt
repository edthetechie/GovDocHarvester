As promised in the referenced airgram, the Mmbassy transmits the
book of condolences which was open for signature following the assassina-
tion of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The book contains the signatures of
Prime Minister Hoveyda and five other Cabinet Ministers, most of the senior
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, virtually all the foreign
Ambassadors and Charges resident in Tehran, persons from all walks of
Iranian life, and persons from the American official, business, and tran-
sient tourist communities. Informal translations have been made of inscrip-
tions written in the Persian language.

The Embassy also forwards the letters of sympathy addressed to the
Ambassador, along with the acknowledgements of the Charge d'Affaires. It
was thought that the Department might wish to forward the book and the
letters to the Kennedy family.
