Mrs, PATRICIA ALICE STRATHMANN, nee Duncan,
2800 Monterey Road, San Marino, California, advised that she
was a classmate of STRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN while attending
Elliott Junior High School, Altadena, California, and John
Muir High School, Pasadena, California. She did not have
any classes with SIRHAN but knew of him.

She also attended one semester at Pasadena City
College (PCC) in 1963.

It was not until after her marriage to JOHN H,.
STRATHMANN in 1964 that she became well acquainted with
SIRHAN.

She last saw SIRHAN approximately four or five
months ago when he had dinner with her and her husband
and, after dinner, he invited her and her husband over to
his house on Howard Street in Pasadena.

She does not know any other close associates of
SIRHAN's, except perhaps an individual whose last name is
CROWE who had been a classmate of SIRHAN's at PCC and who
SIRHAN had helped with the Arabic language.

SIRHAN was very pro-Arabia and the only time he
became emotional was when discussing the Israeli~Arab
conflict. He criticized the United States due to its
support of Israel in the conflict and exoressed a feeling
of appreciation to Russia for its assistance to the Arabs.

When SIRHAN was a horse exercise boy in Corona,
California, he expressed a profound interest in becoming a
jockey and seemed to change considerably following his fall
from a horse in 1966, After the fall, he seemed to brood
and remarked that due to the damage to his eyes, he could
no longer be a jockey.

KANAN ABDUL LATIF HAMZEH, 465 North El Molino,
telephone number 799-5318, who is employed as a salesman
at Robinsons Department Store,, Pasadena, California,
furnished the following information with respect to his
knowledge of SIRHAN STIRHAN:

HAMZEH advised that he first met SIRHAN SIRHAN
approximately three years ago when he (HAMZEH) was enrolled
at Pasadena City College in electrical engineering. While
at the college, he was president of "The Organization of
Arab Students in the United States of America and Canada",
with headquarters at 2929 Broadway, New York City, New York,
10025, telephone number MO 6-0300, This organization was
formed in 1952 to assist Arab students in adjusting to
academic life away from home,

SHARIF SIRHAN, who was a student at Pasadena City
College and a member of the above organization, introduced
SIRHAN SIRHAN to him, HAMZEH,

SIRHAN SIRHAN became a de facto member of this
organization which although active, was not recognized
as a formal organization by Pasadena City College since
such organizations were prohibited to operate on the
campus. It was also not recognized as a formal local
organization by the mother organization in New York City
due to the fact that the college did not authorize it to
operate on the campus. Inspite of the above. technicalities,
HAMZEH stated this organization operated like practically
all organizations of its kind located on other campuses.

HAMZEH stated that he helped SIRHAN SIRHAN with
some math problems that he was having, SIRHAN SIRHAN
also visited his apartment for purposes of taping some
Arabian music which he, HAMZEH, had. Ye recalls that in
the company of SIRHAN SIRHAN was one of his brothers and
his sister.

HAMZEH advised that in conversations with several
of the SIRHAN brothers he learned that SIRHAN SIRHAN had
constant arguments with them as well as with his mother.

He was not told what the arguments were about, but he
surmises they were strictly of a family nature. He recalls
that SIRHAN SIRHAN along with one other brother SAID SIRHAN,
were quite unhappy living in the United States. He thinks
that both brothers were unable to adjust to the social and
political atmosphere in the United States.

When he knew SIRHAN SIRHAN he did not think that
he was capable of any major crime since school seemed to
pe foremost in his mind and not politics as such, which he
did not seem too interested in.

While SIRHAN SIRHAN was a member of the organization
of Arab students, he used to volunteer for some of the less
desirous work of making the meetings which were held at the
local YMCA, more successful. Some of the things he did
were to set up the chairs, arrange for a tape recorder and
arrange for various refreshments for the group.

He would consider SIRHAN SLHHAN to be easily
influenced, however, for any Arab Nationalist cause since
he had some intense feelings against the Israelis.

He does not know who SIRHAN SIRHAN's associates were.
However, he considers that he was more forward than most
Arabian students with respect to meeting female companions
since he would often talk to them in the student lounge
at Pasadena City College,

He does not know of any other interests which
STRHAN SIRHAN had, and he was surprised to read in the
newspapers that SIRHAN SIRHAN seems to have an interest
in philosophy, He stated that he must have greatly changed
since he knew him three years ago, for at that time he
considered SIRHAN SIRHAN to be just an ordinary young man.

JOSEPH GEORGE TABELLO, 236 South Palm Drive, Beverly

Palestine, was interviewed regarding possible meetings which
he attended with Arabic type persons at the Green Hotel,
Pasadena, California during May, 1967, through January, 1968.
He was part-owner of the hotel during this time.

TABELLO denied having any knowledge of such meetings
which might be construed as "underground" or political in
nature. He could only recall. once when he mentioned to his
brother that they might have their church meetings at the hotel,
but they never did. Every so often his family would visit him
at the hotel, .

TABELLO said because he was born in Palestine he
could not deny he is pro-Arab. His home was the first home
to be bombed by Israel in 1948. He lived across the street
from the SIRHAN family in Jerusalem and worked with ADEL
SIRHAN as a carpenter from 1951 to 1953. In fact he can recall
some of his younger brothers playing with SIRHAN SIRHAN, who
was about three or four years old at the time. TABELLO said
he would classify the SIRHAN family as “low class",

TABELLO arrived in the United States on November
15, 1956, going directly to his brother's house in Sheyboygan,
Wisconsin, then to Pasadena, California, in the early 1960's.

After arriving in Pasadena, he renewed his acquaintance
with ADEL SIRHAN and saw him quite frequently at the Fez Night
Club where ADEL was playing as a musician. However, he has not
seen ADEL in about a year. He last saw SIRHAN SIRHAN approxi-
mately three years ago and has only visited the SIRHAN home
once,

To his knowledge, SIRHAN SIRHAN never stated overtly
to him his anti-Jewish beliefs, but most Arabs feel this way

and it would not be ungsSdal. TABELLO could only conjecture ag
to what might have motivated SIRHAN SIRHAN to commit an act of

Israel in building up their military arms. TABELLO also stated

his workouts. PRESTWOOD advised that he visited the stables
several times a month and on each occasion would see SIRHAN.
In January, 196%, Jet Spec ran his first race at Caliente Race
Track. PRESTWOOD said that they had called SIRHAN at his home
and invited him to go see the horse run. It was his recollection

might meet them. SYRHAN accepted the invitation, and although

he wanted to register a complaint. After registering his complaint, sus-~
