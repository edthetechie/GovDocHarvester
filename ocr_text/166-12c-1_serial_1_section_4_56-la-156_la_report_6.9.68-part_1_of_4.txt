was granted a non-quota visa No. 1665 issued under Public Law

He was re-admitted at New York on May ll, 1959. ‘t the time of
the application for the extension he indicated residence at 1321
North Mentor Avenue, Pasadena, California.

On his original immigration to the United States, he
and the members of the family accompanying him were sponsorec in
the United States by HALDOR LILLEWAS. By letter dated August 31,
1957, to Immisration and Naturalization Service, LILLENAS advised
Imaicration and Naturalization Service that he oriszinally met the
SIRHAN family in the City of Jerusalem in 1955 and made arranze-
ments to sponsor the family into the country. The wife and
children seemed to be very happy in the United States. The father
was unhappy and dissatisfied.

LILLENAS assisted him in obtaining employment but
SIRHAN quit his job, stating that the work was too hard and the
hours too long. He informed LILLSNAS that he was very unhappy in
the United States, he did not like the customs or the laws here,
that he could not make his family mind as in his homeland and he
considered returnin;; to Jordan.

LILLENAS set forth quotes from letters he had received
from SIRHAN prior to their arrival in this country: “If you ©
sponsor us you will be delivering a Christian family from absolute
darimess and hopelessness. I assure you that I will be willing to
perform any type of service or job in whatsoever nature - garden,
servant, sweeper — humbly and mildly. I have a sincere purpose
to become a U.S. countryman with a willingness and readiness to
do any kind of work to the satisfaction of any employer.”

LILLENAS stated that SIRHAN failed to live up to these statements.
A postscript to the letter was as follows: "Mr. SIRHAN has, aside
from the things mentioned above, been very brutal to his children.”

By letter dated February 27, 1960, Mrs. HALDOR LILLENAS,
3105 Highview, Altadena, California, requested information con-
cerning the whereabouts of SIRHAN. In this letter she said he
was "an undesirable alien no doubt. His family are fine, hard-
working, worthy people and are getting along fine....”

"Dear Judge Sprankle

"T have seen this young man for 4 hours professionally.
The content of his remarks for these hours has been essentially
the same whether his judgments have truth or fantasy, he has a
highly systematized feeling of persecution. This is not
conducive to adoptive behavior in our society. He does not
comprehend this one bit. Because of his resistant behavior in these
hours, and because he has no visible means of support and since
he has not paid the previous psychotherapist he consulted,
