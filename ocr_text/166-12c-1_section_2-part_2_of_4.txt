ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

A United Press International release on June 13,
1968, indicated an unidentified Arab Government had passed
"new and startling" information to American officials rela~
tive to Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, It is reported by corres-~
pondent John Kimche in the London Evening Standard that
Sirhan had traveled in the Middle East in 1964 for seven
months, He allegedly returned to the Middle East in 1966
spending five months in Cairo, Egypt, before returning to
the United States in the beginning of 1967,

A Reuters dispatch on June 13, 1968, additionally
reported that this individual's full name, according to
Kimche, was Sirhan Bishara Sirhan Abu Khatar, This indi-
vidual, according to the dispatch, was first brought to the
United States in 1928 when he was four years old, He was
allegedly married upon a return to the Middle East on
June 27, 1957, to Leila Ussef Mikhael at Es Salt, Jordan,

Records of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service show that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan entered the United
States on January 12, 1957. His date of birth was given
as Jerusalem, Jordan,

Investigation by our Los Angeles Office reveals
he took up residence with his family in Pasadena, California,
immediately upon his entry into the United States attending
the Pasadena city schools until graduation from the John
Muir High School in June, 1963, Thereafter he attended
Pasadena City College until May of 1965,

Investigation reveals that during 1964

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was attending school and employed at
two Pasadena, California, service stations, Investigation
further indicates that during 1966 he was continuous
the Pasadena, California, area, 66. fC. £

In addition, each of Sirhan's four brothers was
interviewed by Special Agents of the Los Angeles Office of
the FBI on June 13, 1968, at which time they advised Sirhan
has never left the United States since his arrival in 1957,
They pointed out that the word Abu Khatar, meaning "is the
father of Khatar," is a term not used by Christians and that
the Sirhan family is Christian,

The Department of State has advised that it has
received no communication from any country in the Middle
East relative to the aforementioned matter, According to
the Department of State, information was received from the |)
American Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, to the effect that ji
a United Press International correspondent had reportedly
talked with Sirhan's father in Jordan who stated that to
his knowledge Sirhan never married and the other details
contained in the original story of June 13, 1968, are
highly improbable,

According to the Department of State an attempt
was made by that agency in London to contact Jon, also known
as John, Kimche with whom this story originated. Kimche re-
fused to identify his source but reiterated his source is
usually reliable, According to the Department of State he
seemed unimpressed by the possibility this might be a simple
case of mistaken identity.

Kimche, according to the Central Intelligence
Agency, is an able, unscrupulous free lance journalist in
London who apparently supports official Israeli Zionist
lines in his work. The Central Intelligence Agency reports
that during early 1968 there were strong protests from
American Government circles in London against his articles
which appeared to be aimed at destroying relations between
the United States and Arab countries.

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

We are continuing interviews with individuals
who were at or near the scene of the shooting at the
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, during the
evening of June 4-5, 1968, in an effort to establish
full facts relative to the activities of Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan,

Rafer Lewis Johnson, Olympic champion who
assisted in subduing Sirhan, advises that while he was
holding Sirhan immediately after subduing him he held
his fist to Sirhan's head and repeated the question
"Why did you do it?" The assailant's only reply to

’ Johnson was "I'll explain it,"

Another witness, Jesus Perez, saw Sirhan,
gun in hand, immediately after Senator Kennedy had
been shot. He stated Sirhan is identical with an
individual who talked to him briefly just before
midnight June 4, 1968, inquiring as to whether Senator
Kennedy would pass their way after his speech.

Investigation indicates that the itinerary
for Senator Kennedy was modified somewhat during the
evening of June 4, 1968, due to delays in receiving
election returns. According to information received
from Senator Kennedy's Public Relations Director for
the California Campaign, the decision to take the
route directly to the Colonial Room at the Ambassador
Hotel was made on the stage immediately. after Senator
Kennedy's speech. Inquiry into this phase is continuing.

Houston, Texas .77027. June 13, 1968

United States Attorney General

The Honorable Ramsey Clark “eS -+ oS a
pop mo

Department of Justice
Washington, D. C.

My Dear Mr. Clark:

Having read in the newspapers and seen on television so much about the assassination
of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, I cannot help but express some ideas of mine to you.

I wish to repeat again that my entire knowledge of this case comes only and alone from
the publicity itself.

We know the following facts:

1.

2.

The assassin was born in the Jordanian held part of Jerusalem.
He left Jerusalem at the age of approximately 1 or 2 years.
He has lived in this country approximately 20 years.

He apparently is a member of some Arabic Student Organization.

He had in his pocket a piece of paper on which was written that Sen. Kennedy
had to be killed before June 5.

He states he felt he had to kill the Senator because of his remarks that
weapons and arms will have to be supplied to the State of Israel for her
protection against expected Arab aggression.

His father, in Jerusalem, stated in one interview by a press correspondent,
that he was sorry about the assassination of the Senator, and a few days later
he revised his statement after "he was set straight", saying that he felt his
son was justified in this act of murder. (I suspect some sort of brain-
washing by the Arab Terror Organization).

The assassin bad about $400.00 in cash on him when he was captured, which could
not have been his own money from the income of the small job he was holding at
that time.

If I put all the above bits of information together, I seem to come to this conclusion:

How did the assassin know exactly which way Sen. Kennedy would leave the ballroom after
his last speech? (it said in the paper that he was waiting for the Senator in the hall.
way of the hotel); why was Sen. Kennedy selected to be killed when each one of the
hopeful candidates for the Presidency expressed about the same ideas and views, includ-
ing Sen. McCarthy, V.P. Humphrey, Gov. Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon?


--- Page 27 ---
O ° Page 2

The Honorable Ramsey Clark, 4 Attorney General, Washington,' Cc. wee

How did the assassin know that Sen. Kennedy would come into this hallway?

As outlined above, the assassin was a member of an Arabic Student Organization and
we have seen in this country that students in general are getting somewhat restless
and young people from the Middle-East, due to their temperamental build up, even more
S060

We also know for a fact that amongst the Arabian countries there is a very radical
and chauvinistic organization: El-Fatah, which not only makes constant raids into
Israel but also threatens everybody who does not cooperate with them, including even
King Feisal of Transjordan.

I cannot help but feel that a good deal of the Arabic Student Associations in this
country are under the very strong influence of this Terror Organization and have been
forced to interfere directly with the inner-political affairs of our country, by
selecting prominent figures for assassination. Therefore, it seems impossible to me that
only ONE man was assigned to kill the Senator.

The fact that in his pocket was the slip of paper stating that Sen. Kennedy had to be
killed before June 5 (the outbreak of last years Middle-East war) seems to indicate
even stronger that the whole plot must have been organized in some way and I firmly
believe that other persons were posted in the crowd also to shoot at the Senator had

he moved to a different location.

It is quite possible that all my ideas and ways of thinking are completely wrong but I
definitely believe that this avenue should be thoroughly investigated to prevent
similar cases in the future that might come from the same direction.

I will appreciate very much if you would be kind enough to advise me, if I am entirely
out of order or not by this my communication to you.

Very respectfully yours,

E. ERNST SCHAEFER

Congressman William Bates
Cannon House Office Building
Washington D.C.

Dear Congressman Bates,

I realize that at this time, you and other congressmen must be
flooded with mail, mostly pertaining to the passage of a strict
gun control bill. Though this concerns me, this letter does
not relate to the gun matter,

Mr. Bates, I am worried and frightened about the tragic events
of the past five years and the fact that “assassination” is
becoming a household word. I eannot, I will not, slip back
fnto the workaday, business as usual routine without expressing
my feelings to the person who is my link to the pewer structure
in Washington. That person is you.

Ever since President Kennedy's death, there have been numerous
books and articles written which contradicts the findings of

the Warren Commission. These discrepancies, pointed out first
and foremost by Mr.Mark Lane, are so poignant that it absolutely
mystifies me that no one in Washington has bothered to delve
into the matter further.

In the light of recent events and I am speaking primarily of
the murder of Robert Kennedy, it is ouite apparent that many,
many people are uttering "conspiracy". With all my heart, I
pelieve this to be so and nothing has been said or written to
make me change my position.

But, Mr.eBates, I am only one person. A twenty-five year old
housewife who can only grit her teeth, wave an angry fist in
the air and curse the person or persons behing these murders.

Mr, Bates, I assume you do not live in a vacuum. I assume

you must be aware of the tension and frustration re-created
once more with Robert Kennedy's murder. Tell me, Mr. Bates,
are all the other people in Washington aware of this? “

I firmly believe that the basic foundation which Americans
build their free lives upon is trembling as if to signal

croaching earthouake. That foundation is trust. ;
trust in the men who run our government from President Johnsofi

on down. Trust that enables us to live our daily lives oo
without worrying (until now, perhaps) that something awful
te strangling the throat of Justice and is threatening

~


--- Page 33 ---
. . page 2 .
. ; r ) e

the basic tenets of the democracy which most Americans
pelieve in so strongly.

Mr. Bates, let me ask you some questions. Perhaps, you have
heafd them before.

Point_l. District Attorney Jim Garrison of New Orleans claims
he has evidence which would prove there was a
conspiracy to kill President Kénnedy.

Question. Why has the United States government imposed an
injunction on this man in relation to the Clay
Shaw trial? Why are they so adamant in their refusal
to aid Jim Garrison?

It seems to me, Mr. Bates, that the United States government

should-be eager to do everything in their power to see that

truth is allowed to reach the surface. Even if Mr.Garrison's
claims and ev&dence is far-fetched (and I emphasize “if*)

I should think the government would want to do everything it

could to disprove this evidence by allowing Garrison to lay

his cards on the table in a court of law .

Isn't there aprons in Washington who. can help this come about?

I think it wou put the minds of many people at ease. This

way, the speculation becomes increasingly dangerous. It

includes the claim that there are people in our government
who were and are involved in this awful thing.

Because no one in power seems to be doing anything about this,

4t seems like, 1. There is a stranglehold on the people in

power imposed by someone, or, 2. The people in Washington
don't want "to rock the boat",

Point 2. It seems tHere are two men; one in California and
one in Texas in whom Mr.Garrison is most interested.
But neither Governor of those states will sign
Seen eae t intended ‘
fon Assuming at the governmen ntended to assis
Question Mr.Garrison, isn't there some way they could overrule
the heads of those states?
The thing that puzzles me is why Governor Connolly won't aid
any way he can since he himself was almost a victim on
November 22, 1963. (More speculation om my part. Or was
Governer Gonnolly intended to be a victim at all?)
Do you see, Mr.Bates, how dangerous this wave of uncertainty can

b
T ask you agains Isn't there anyone inrWashington who is willing
to break all the barriers and fully investigate the two Kennedy

murders?

Point 3. Invaluable information pertaining to the murder of
President Kennedy has been locked away somewhere and
cannot be revealed until the year 2039, 75 years from
now. I can assure you that in my own cirele of friends,

this is a "real bugaboo".

Question. Who, in 75 years, will care as much as we the people
who are living now? More to the point, what,in 75
years, will anyone be able to do about it?


--- Page 34 ---
Page 3 . .
This as a haunting mystery. If there was anyone in power who
cared enough for the truth, this material soltd be de-classified.
And what whuld it prove, Mr.Bates? Would it prove, perhaps, how

far away from the facts the Warren Commission strayed to réach
its conclusions?

I think Americans want to know for sure, and to their full
satisfaction what the truth is behind these murders. TY
seriously doubt that many people are either sure or satisfied
with the results of that Commission. Not when 80 much is
pointed out which contradicts it. Not when so little is

done to fully investigate every possible angle and that
4ncludes assisting and co-operating with the district
attorney from New Orleans.

Mr.Bates, on the basis of what I have said, I firmly believe
that the same people behind the murder of. President Kennedy
also conspired to do away with his brother. I believe that
those conspirators were afraid that if Robert Kennedy became
president, he would then be in a posiition to either publicly
or prévately investigate every facet of his brother's death.
I believe that someone or some persons fed poison into the
mind of Sirhan Sirhan about Kenned¥'s stand on our commitment
to Israel. Eugene McCarthy also stressed our commitment to
Israel as have other politicians. But Robert Kennedy was
singled out. One reason for Sirhan to kill Kennedy and one
reason for someone else to have Kennedy killed.

Mr. Bates, all I am 1s a concerned and worréed citizen. There
4s nothing I want more than to believe in the integrity and
honesty of my government but in the past five years there

have been serious accusations made against it by dissenters

of the Warren Commission.

I think it has cast a dark shadow over the entire country.

I think the onlv way to lift this shadow is for someone or

some people to aid My. Garrison. If his claims are indeed
valid, 1t will only mean that the American people will finally
have the satisfaction of seeing evil men punished. The government
owes this to the American people. We put the men there who make
up our government. We are not their slaves and this is not
1980, the year of Big Brother!

If Mr. Garrison's claims are nonsense and are found to be so,

in a court of law, then only Mr. Garrison will @ look the part

of a fool.

Until Mark Lane's telling ouestions are explained and anewered
to the satisfaction of all and until the evidence of Jim
Garrison is presented and either proved or disproved in a
court of law beyond a shadow of a doubt, then I am afraid,

Mr. Bates, that we are in for more bloodshed. I eannot see
how this can be avoided. If there is, in fact, a conspiracy,
Mr.Bates, will there have to be another assassination to prove
it? There will be other men who will represent everything
the Kennedys stood for. are "they" going to kill them all?
Can't we find out now, for certain, in a court of law?


--- Page 35 ---
. , @ °

I find it hard to believe that out of all the men who make
up the power structure in Washington, there 1s not one who
disagrees with the findings of the Warren Commission. I
find it hard to believe that there is not one man in power
who will dig and dig for the truth about these murders and
present this truth to Americans and to the world.

Do you know of such a one, Mr.Bates, who would be willing to
go all out?

The truth, no matter how shattering it may be, is always
ultimately accepted. It becomes easy to live with truth
once it is accepted but first it must be known, for certain.
However, it is very difficult to Live with uncertainty and
wonder and speculation. Living under these conditions makes
peovle tense, uneasy and frustrated. It makes them speculate
wildly and perhaps dangerously. It shakes their trust.
Nobody likes to be deceived. ,

Mr.Bates, almost five years have passed since P resident
Kennedy's death and still and more vehemently the contradictions
of the conclusions of that death still persist and now, with

the death of his brother, I believe more and more people are
completely dissatisfied with what has been done to offset

those contradictions. Namely nothing. "Conspiracy" is

being tossed around more and more and who can blame anyon

for being suspicious? ;
Mr. Bates, I implore you, as an American citizen and as a
man in power, if there is anything, anything you can do

to allay the fears and worries of many people concerning the
Kennedy murders, please do it. If there are people in
Washington or anywhere else that you mow have the power to
fully investigate these two murders honestly and with the
objective of bringing the whole truth to light, I beg you to
intervene.

I say the murders of John and Robert Kennedy are linked.
I say the same forces behind the first murder were behind the last.
And, I say desperately, that too much time has already passed by.

Obviously, there are many, many contradictions to the Warren
Report which I have not stated. It took many books to do that
and you pwobably know them all. I don't know if you do or not.

Mr.Bates, Mark Lane made a statement on, Tuesday June 4, that
Robert Kennedy had in some way been in touch with the office

j of Jim Garrison. According to Mr. Lane, Mr.Kennedy also

| believed his brother's death to be the work of conspirators.

““six hours after Mark Lane made this public, Robert Kennedy
was shot.
This 1s what prompts me to believe that his death was the
result of someone being afraid that he might re-investigate
the findings of the Warren Commission or perhaps in some way
help Jim Garrison which, in turn, would result in the truth.
These are thoughts which run through my head and which I can't
get rid of. I doubt that I'm the only one. It Just isn't fair

Please, Mr. Bates, for the security and well-being of the
American people, let us search and seize the truth in every
hidden nook and cranny. Let us do everything we can to
re-instate in the American people a feeling of trust and
confidence in our government. For without this trust and
confidence, Mr. Bates, there cannot be security and nothing
lasts long that is not secured tightly. I am convinced that
a complete and honest re-assessment of the first Kennedy
murder and the recent one, would help instill this in the
American people.

After this letter, Mr.Bates, there is little else I can do.
You gre in a far better position than I. Now what can you do?

Sincerely,

Mrs.Lenora Salyuocci

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA is...

Interviews with witnesses into the shooting of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy continue, as well as interviews
with associates and former employers of the accused assail~
ant Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, Approximately 207 employees of
the Ambassador Hotel have been interviewed to date.

Roosevelt Grier, professional football player
who was present at Senator Kennedy's speech in the
Ambassador Hotel at Los Angeles, California, during the
night of June 4, 1968, related to FBI Agents how he, with
the assistance of hotel employees and Rafer Johnson, Olympic
champion, disarmed Sirhan after the shooting, Another ;
individual, Louis Shelby, a restaurant owner where Adel Sirhan
had been employed, described the assailant as an extremely —
frustrated individual and one who was convinced the United ;
States was involved in the furtherance of Zionist goals.

Chief Deputy District Attorney, Los Angeles County,
Lynn Compton, has advised our Los Angeles Office that a review
of investigation conducted by the investigative staff of the
District Attorney's office and the Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment fails to indicate that there is any evidence to support
Sirhan was associated with anyone else or conspired with any
other person in the assassination of Senator Kennedy.

With respect to the prosecution of Sirhan, it has
been reported that Mr. Wilbur Littlefield, Chief Trial Deputy
in the Office of the Public Defender, has been named to
represent Sirhan, The news media indicates Sirhan reportedly
desires two private attorneys to defend him but alleged he
bas stated he could not afford to retain private counsel,

Littlefield was placed in charge eting
