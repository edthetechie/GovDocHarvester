"FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION -

Colonel ‘JOHN H. “GLENN, Room 1001, Sheraton Boston
Hotel, advised that he was an aide: -in. the campaign of Sénator
ROBERT KENNEDY in the California primary election. He stated
that he: was in an upstairs suite at the Ambassador Hotel in .
Los Angeles, California, when Senator KENNEDY was shot in, the
early morning of June 5, 1968. Colonel GLENN stated he did
not see the captured gunman on.that occasion nor did he: recognize
SIRHAN B.: SIRHAN from photographs as an individual he vhad ever
seen previously on. any occasion.

Colonel GLENN stated that the only significant change
the could recall in connection with Senator KENNEDY's plans
was on June 4, 1968. ‘The original plans were that he would
spend the night of June 3-4, 1968, at the.Ambassador Hotel.
However, after a complete day of campaigning on June 3,.1968,
which ended in San Diego, California, KENNEDY returned to the
Ambassador Hotel late that evening and departed soon after-
wards for the Malibu Beach residence of movie director JOHN

. PRANKENHEIMER.. KENNEDY and several of his party spent.the
'. following. day at. “Malibu Beach and returned: to the Ambassador.
"Hotel around 8:00 PM, June 4, 1968.

Colonel GLENN could. recall no other significant
changes in regard to Senator KENNEDY ts itinerary. -
