Race Track in 1966 as the result of his application for

Racing Commission for making an unsatisfactory ride as a
jockey and giving falge testimony before the track Stewards.

Mr. HANSON said at the time of the application for
Santa Anita credentials on January 25, 1°66, RAMISTELLA

of guilty to this charce and was sentenced to 60 days in
the County Jail, sentence suspended. He had been previously
arrested on September 3, 1956, at Jamaica, New York, for
possession of marijuana, and this charze was later dismissed.

RAMISTELLA was finserprinted at Delaware Park Race
Track on June 16, 1°64, as an applicant for exercise boy license.

On September 1°, 1967, MARTIN CRUIKSHANK, Bank of
America, telephone 663-.35S1, telephoned TRPB Agent R. H.
WILLIAMS regarding any current information ag to the whereabouts
of FRANK DONNARUMMA. According to CRUIKSHANK, DONNARUMMA had
purchased a 1962 Lincoln Continental, California license GHH &°5,
eivine hie address as 123200 Citrus Street, Corona, California,
and financed this vehicle throvgen the Bank of America. Mr. CRUIKSHAI
indicated that the payments on this venicle are delinquent and

Date .

STEVEN SMITH, Southern California Coordinator for the
KENNEDY Campaign, made available through a clerk, LUCY SALINGER,
copies of proposed itineraries to be utilized by the Senator
and his party in their West Coast Campaign.

These itineraries cover the dates of March 23 through
March 25, 1968, April 18 and 19, 1968, May 6, 7, 15, 16, 20, 21,
22, 2h, 28, 29, 30, and 31, 1958, and June 2, 3, and 4, 1968.

i SMITH advised these schedules normally would have

been prepared by the "Advance Men," JERRY BRUNO or JOR DOLAN,
BRUNO would have been more concerned with the travel during the
latter part of May 1968, while DOLAN was more active in the
earlier dates and, he believed, particularly in the Oregon travel.

SMITH stated further that these itineraries were
. subject to change and that more specific information should be
- available through the KENNEDY Headquarters in Washington, D. C.,
as to any alterations that may have occurred in the original
schedule.
