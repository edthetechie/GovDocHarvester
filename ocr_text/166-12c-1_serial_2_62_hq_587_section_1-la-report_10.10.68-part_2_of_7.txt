Mr. JAMES (JIMMY) BRESLIN was interviewed at
Gallagher's Steak House, 228 West 5end Street, New York,
New York. He stated that he writes for several newspapers
throughout the United States and that his agent is the
Sterling Lord Literary Agency, 75 East 55th Street, New York,
New York. He resides at 52 Deepdene Road, Forest Hills,
New York.

Starting on March 17, 1968, he covered several
of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's Presidential campaign trips.

During the evening of. June 4, 1968, he was in the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, when Senator
KENNEDY made his victory speech. The iimbassy Room in which
Senator KENNEDY made his speech was very crowded so BRESLIN
went to the press room which was near the Embassy Room and
watched the speech on television.

When the speech ended an individual, he thinks was
DICK DRAYNS of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's staff, appeared at
the door of the press room and said that Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY was on his way to the press room. Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY after his speeches made it a habit to visit the
press room and talk to the press.

BRESLIN went to the door of the press room to wave
to Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. He did not see Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY, but while at the doorway he heard what at first he
thought was a eh chen tray drop to the floor. It was a
shot and there, three or four more. At the most, BRESLIN heard
four or five shots. People were running and screaming and
BRESLIN ran towards where the sound of the shots came from.

Many persons in the crowd were screaming. These
people were to BRESLIN's left. Senator ROB2RT KENNEDY was
lying to BRESLIN's left. In the immediate vicinity was PAUL
SCHRAD#, also lying on the floor.To BRESLIN's approximate right
was BILL BARRY of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's staff.

BARRY had someone by the arm which was extended
up and which hand held a black-barrelepistol. The hand
with the pistol then went down onto a table. Someone was
jumping on the table. The hand holding the gun dropped it
and then something happened and the hand again picked up
the gun. ROSIE GRIER then threw a male on a table and held
him down and grabbed the male by the arm. BRUSLIN then saw
the person on the table for the first time. It was STRHAN
SIRHAN. At this moment ROSIE GRIER was holding the gun in
his, GRIER's, left hand. ;

At approximately this time GEORGE PLIMPTON had
SIRHAN by his head; WARREN ROGERS had his left leg; and
RAFER JOHNSON was grabbing his hand.

BRESLIN was of the impression at the time that
the gun was still loaded and he tricd to get it away from
ROSIE GRIER, GRIER would not release the gun. RAFER
JOHNSON then asked GRIER for the gun and GRIER gave the
gun to JOHNSON.

BRESLIN, standing very close to SIRHAN and being
face to face with him, asked him twice, "Why did you have to
do it?" SIRHAN's eyes were rolling and he did not answer.
SIRHAN then tried to thrash around with his legs and body,
put those holding him kept him secure.

After SIRHAN SIRHAN was secured by BARRY, JOHNSON,
GRIER, PLIMPTON, and ROGERS, and being held by GRIER;
JOHNSON, PLIMPTON and ROGERS, BILL BARRY went to Senator
ROBERT KENNEDY. BRESLIN occasionally looked over at Senator
ROBERT KENNEDY.

The police then arrived and SIRHAN was turned over
to them by GRIZR, JOHNSON, PLIMPTON and ROGERS.

BRESLIN stated that he did not see the actual

shooting and that he had not seen SIRHAN before this. He
saw no one in a polka dot dress.

BRESLIN has since heard several reports concerning
the shooting. One was that DICK TUCK of Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY's staff chased SIRHAN off the platform twice and
another that DICK HARWOOD of the Washington Post actually
saw SIRHAN shoot Senator ROBERT KENNUDY.

EVAN FREED, 9431 Cresta Drive, Los Angeles,
California, telephone 870 5900, advised as follows:

Until recently, he was a freelance photographer
for the Copley News Service. In that capacity, for about
four weeks prior to the assassination of the late Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY, he had covered the Senator's activities
in the Los Angeles area. At about 7:00 PM the night of the
1968 California Primary (June 4, 1968) he went to the Embassy
Room of the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, where he remained
for approximately fifteen minutes and then went up-
stairs to the KENNEDY rooms on the fifth floor where he
stayed until about midnight when Senator KENNEDY and his
party went downstairs to the Embassy Room. FREED did not
accompany them but used the stairs to reach the Embassy
Room. About twenty five feet outside of the Embassy
Room, he became involved in an altercation with another
photographer during which time his camera was damaged. In
order to get out of the crowd, he went to the kitchen area
of the Ambassador Hotel to try to fix his camera. He was
still in the kitchen area when Senator KENNEDY, who had
finished his appearance in the Embassy Room, entered the
kitchen through the main door to the kitchen. At the time,
FREED was located at a row of tables.in the corridor. The
Senator shook hands with numerous people on entering the
area. The Senator was within six to eight feet of
FREED when the latter let his gaze drop towards the floor
and at that moment FREED heard noises which sounded to him
like firecrackers going off. He then looked up and saw a
man shooting a gun. Some people were trying to grab the
individual while others were “hitting the floor". The man
who was doing the shooting subsequently was identified as
SIRHAN SIRHAN. SIRHAN was the only person FREED saw shooting.
FREED did not see Senator KENNEDY hit by gunfire or see him
fall to the floor, but he did subsequently observe the
Senator lying on the floor and thoughthe, the Senator, was
dead. There was much shouting at this time, and FREED did
not hear any particular conversation. The man who was

a week to 479 14th Street, Brooklyn, New York.

He is a free lance writer and on June 4-5, 1968,

During the evening of June 4, 1968, prior to
Senator KENNEDY making his victory speech, HAMILL was
in Senator KENNEDY's suite in the Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California, with Senator KENNEDY and JIMMY
BRESLIN, the writer. HAMILL went to the elevator with
Senator KENNEDY when Senator KENNEDY was on his way-to make
his victory speech.

There was confusion at the elevators and
HAMILL did not get on the same elevator with Senator KENNEDY.

During Senator KENNEDY's speech, HAMILL stood on
the podium to Senator KENNEDY's rear and left. This was
near the left rear corner of the podium near some drapes and
some stairs that went down. Standing near HAMILL were GEORGE
PLIMPTON, the writer, and PLIMPTON's wife, FREDDY. Standing
near the stairs was BILL BARRY of Senator KENNEDY's staff.

BARRY pointed to a corridor to the pantry. HAMILL and
PLIMPTON went out that way which was down the nearby
stairs and HAMILL did not see Senator KENNEDY leave the
podium. HAMILL next saw Senator KENNEDY in the pantry.
HAMILL was walking along with GEORGE PLIMPTON in front of
Senator KENNEDY and to his (Senator KENNEDY's) right about
ten feet. HAMILL did not know that Senator KENNEDY was
going to the press room but thought Senator KENNEDY

was headed for "The Factory" where a party was to be
held, As HAMILL was walking along and looking back,

he saw Senator KENNEDY turn to his left to shake

hands with someone. . After Senator KENNEDY shook hands
with this individual, he (Senator KENNEDY) turned to
continue walking straight ahead. At this time what
HAMILL thought were five shots were fired in very

rapid succession, HAMILL looked and saw SIRHAN SIRHAN
who was standing in front of and to Senator KENNEDY's
left about seven or eight feet with his (SIRHAN's)

arm fully extended and his face in tremendous concentration
shooting a gun at Senator KENNEDY. Senator KENNEDY

was falling to the floor and someone caught Senator
KENNEDY,

ROSIE GRIER ran by HAMILL and "slammed" SIRHAN into
a table. GEORGE PLIMPTON rushed over to SIRHAN and went
for the gun. RAFER JOHNSON came out of somewhere and HAMILL
thinks that JOHNSON got the gun. SIRHAN was "thrown
up on a table" or group of tables and "slid down to the
end of the table" or tables.

There was much yelling and noise and HAMILL
was momentarily "stupified". He then looked at his
watch, It was 12:12 a.m., June 5, 1968. HAMILL heard
people saying such things to SIRHAN as "Why did you do it?"
HAMILL did not hear SIRHAN say anything.

HAMILL stated that he did not see or notice
SIRHAN before the shooting. HAMILL did not touch SIRHAN.

QUINN advised that he was in the Ballroom of the
Ambasgador Hotel, in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 1968,
He was on as news commentator for the midnight news. Just
as he was about to finish his news broadcast, he heard a lot
of screaming and shrieking and someone ran into the room
and shouted that Senator KENNEDY had been shot. He immediately
left the room and forced himsélf through crowds of people
into the kitchen area. He walked up to Senator KENNEDY who
was lying on the floor with his head in what appeared to be
blood. QUINN got up on a serving table and stayed there until
Senator KZNNEDY was removed from the room.

QUINN advised that Senator KENNEDY was awake while
he was lying on the floor. QUINN recalled hearing a voice,
similar to Senator KENNEDY's saying "Can you please step
‘back so I can have some air." Senator KENNEDY was fingering
a rosary on his waist line and BTHEL KENNEDY was rubbing
his chest. ETHEL seemed to be calm.

QUINN advised that when Senator KENNEDY was picked
up by three or four men, he said about five times in a very
painful voice, "No!" KENNEDY was placed on a stretcher,
and his eyes were now closed. QUINN did not know if Senator

number 674-5615, was interviewed at her residence and provided
the following information:

BRAND advised that she had been employed as a
Kennedy Girl in order to work for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
in his seeking the Presidential nomination. On June 4, 1968,
BRAND stated that she was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles, and was making preparations to leave the hotel when
she stopped to shake hands with ALAN CRANSTON, the Demoractic
candidate for United States Senate, when someone rushed past
her shouting, "KENNEDY has been shot." She stated that she
was “not close to the actual assagsination and did not see
any of the occurrencesat that time. She said that eventually
after the people were allowed to leave the hotel, she was taken
to her home by a girlfriend.

BRAND stated that prior to the assassination, she
was waiting, along with a large group of people, for the
Senator to come down from his room and make his victory speech.
She stated that she, along with several other Kennedy Girls,
were lined up along a doorway corridor when she noticed an
individual take up a position directly in front of her. She
said she made a comment to an NBC newsman who was standing close
to her, “look at this". She stated she made this statement
because the Kennedy Girls had been given rather preferential
treatment and were allowed to assume position in front of the
crowd. BRAND stated that the newsman then asked this individual
to move and the individual replied, "This won't take long.”
BRAND said that this individual left a short time thereafter
and she did not pay any attention to where he went. She said
that she described this individual as being of possible foreign
extraction with dark trousers, light blue shirt and having
bushy hair. She said that she could not say with any degree of
certainty that this individual was identical with SIRHAN SITRHAN,
but that she had noticed some characteristics of this individual
as being similar to the description of SIRHAN,

Ambassador Hotel with VERNON THOMPSON, an NBC electronics
technician and they parked the car at the rear of the
Ambassador. They went to the Ballroom located underneath
the Embassy Room in the hopes of seeing the Senator, but
when he did not arrive by 11:45 pm, THOMPSON left to see
where he was and came back and said that the Senator would be
upstairs. THOMPSON told her that heihad gone to the NBC

stairs leading to the Embassy Room and entered the Embassy
Room, passing by a guard who did not challenge them.

They took up a position approximately four people
deep from the front of the platform and just to the Senator's
right. Just before the Senator finished his speech, a cordon
of men formed to the Senator's right, leading from the

She observed Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor
and one eye was open slightly more than the other. He
appeared conscious, but she saw no blood on him, so she
assumed that he was all right. She returned.in the kitchen
area until the Senator was wheeled away by some ambulance
attendants and then she returned to the main Ballroom where

she told everyone that the Senator was all right.

She later returned to her barked ear with
THOMPSON and they discussed seeing the individual on the
platform steps poking under the platform with his shoe.
They then went back to the Ballroom and observed the bracing
under the steps was very narrow, being approximately ad
one foot wide.

She went with THOMPSON to the NBC Burbank Studios
and stayed there until approxima tely| 4: OO am.

She stated that she telephonically contacted the
Los Angeles Police Department and informed the department
about what she had seen in the Ballroom for whatever
significance it would have in their investigation. She
was shown photographs of STRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN taken following
his apprehension and she advised that the individual who
stood in front of her at the bottom of the platform steps
in her opinion, is not identical to SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.
She stated that in a previous interview, an officer of the
Los Angeles Police Department, had shown her other photo-

graphs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, wholwas dressed up at the

time, and she does not consider those photographs shown
as being identical to SIRHAN BISHARA,;SIRHAN either. She
also saw photographs of the brothers!of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN,
and she recalls that the photograph of ADEL SIRHAN is a
likeness, however, she does not feel that ADEL is identical
with the individual who was in frontlof her.

RICHARD JOHN FRICK, 205 North Armel, age 21,
advised during the previous semester, he was working for
"Students for KENNEDY" at the University of California at
Santa Barbara. He advised as follows:

On June 4, 1963, he departed Santa Barbara, California,
arriving at Los Angeles about 10:00 p.m. and went to the
Ambassador Hotel. He met a friend and obtained a Press
Pass so that he could go to .the Embassy Room, but first
he visited the KENNEDY suite on the Fifth floor and talked
briefly to Mrs. KENNEDY there. Then he went downstairs with
the KENNEDY party, and as he entered the Embassy Room, he
and his girl friend, VAIERIE SCHULTE, from Santa Barbara,
were challenged by security guards. They would not let the
girl into the room and also attempted to exclude several
cameramen, but they finally let him through with the Press

Pass. During Senator KENNEDY's speech, he stood about
twenty feet in front of the platform, and as KENNEDY exited
from the platform, he attempted to follow him but could not
get very close because of the crowd and the number of newsmen
who were pushing ahead of him, He did not see KENNEDY again
until after the shooting.

He was about twenty or more feet behind the KENNEDY
party in the corridor, when he heard what he Bhought
were either shots or the slamming of refrigerator doors in
the kitchen. Next, he heard someone
shout to the effect that KENNEDY had been shot, and persons he
believed to be KENNEDY aides were screaming for people to ;
get out. There was much shoving as the crowd surged forward,
and he could see cameramen with television lights focusing
on somebody on the floor. There was complete confusion and
Someone hit him in the left ribs. He saw Mr. SCHRADE lying
on the floor, and at this time there were about twenty-five
or thirty persons in that area.

He worked his way close to the left wall and got
within a few feet of where the Senator was lying on the floor.

A Negro doctor came in and began to administer to Mr. SCHRADE,
and someone insisted that he look at the Senator. At this
point he saw his girl friend, VALERIE SCHULTE, standing

near IRA GOLDSTEIN, who was wounded. Shortly thereafter,
someone placed partitions around the wounded Senator, and

he could not see him again, but he stayed in this room for
one hour, staying near his girl friend, VALERIE, who was

very upset and who was sitting on the floor. She was
recuperating because of a broken leg.

He did not see SIRHAN SIRHAN at all and was not
a witness to the shooting.

The only other witness he knew in that room
was NANCY WALLACE, nee Webber. She recently married JOHN

ROBERT M, KIASE, 7800 Clearfiel Ayenue, Van Nuys;
California, was interviewed at his place of employment;
3850 Wilshire Boulevard, at which time he furnished the
following information:

L He himself was not a volunteer for the Kennedy Committee,
. however, he and his wife are good friends of JUDY ROYER and
on the night of June 4, 1963, they went to the Ambassador Hotel
to await the results of the California primary election. They
arrived at approximately 7:30 PM and,with the use of some blue
passes which JUDY ROYER had obtained for them, they went to the
Embassy Room of the hotel.

KLASE and his wife spent most of the evening in the
Embassy Room, but at approximately 11:00 PM he left the room
to get some drinks. After leaving the room, the security
guard at the main entrance refused to let him in because the
room had become crowded. In an effort to reenter the room, he
went through the kitchen area. At that time, he did not
notice anyone in the kitchen.

Upon reentering the Embassy Room, he went to the
area where the ABC television cameras were set up to await the
arrival of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

While waiting in the vicinity of the television
cameras, & man,who was monitoring one of the doors adjacent
to the podium on which Senator KENNEDY was to give his speech,
asked him if he would mind watching the door for a few minutes.
KLASE consented to watch the door and while doing so he observed
a man who was later identified to him as SITRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
attempting to pass through the door. As SIRHAN attempted to
go through the door, KLASE tapped him on the shoulder and said
that no one was allowed in! the area other than members of the
ABC staff. At this point, SIRHAN turned around and went back
into the central area of the Embassy Room. At the time KLASE
observed him, he was wearing a light blue pullover shirt and
blue wash trousers. SIRHAN did not have a jacket on and
KLASE observed that since the shirt and trousers were tight
fitting it was unlikely that SIRHAN had a gun in his possession
at this time.

Approximately one half hour after the incident
involving SIRHAN, Senator KENNEDY arrived to give his victory
speech. On the arrival of Senator KENNEDY, one of the doors.
which KLASE had previously been watching was opened directly
in front of him and he was unable to see Senator KENNEDY.
After listening to the Senator for a few minutes, he left the
Embassy Room, passed through the kitchen and went to the
Colonial Room. While passing through the area of the kitchen,
he met JUDY ROYER and she accompanied him to the Colonial Room.
Upon arrival at the Colonial Room, they watched the Senator on
television for a few minutes and then decided to try to return
to the Embassy Room by means of the kitchen area.

As he and ROYER were walking through the kitchen, they
saw the crowd moving towards the Colonial Room and realized
that Senator KENNEDY had finished his speech and was now making
his way towards the Colonial Room by way of the kitchen area.
Since they wanted to avoid the crowd surrounding Senator KENNEDY,
they both turned around and were making their way back towards
the Colonial Room when KLASE heard several loud pops which
sounded like firecrackers. At this point, he was approximately
30 feet from Senator KENNEDY and he could not actually see the
Senator. However, he did see people pushing and struggling
with someone. At this point, there was a great deal of shouting
and someone yelled that the door should be watched and
no one be allowed to come in. KLASE went to the door of the
Colonial Room and refused to allow anyone entrance into the
kitchen area. After standing at the door to the Colonial Room
for a few minutes, one of the security guards came by and KLASE
asked him to keep the people from coming into the kitchen area.
He then attempted to go to the area where the shooting had
occurred, but because of the crowd he was unable to see any of
the injured people.

While standing in the vicinity of the Colonial Room
door, he observed officers of the Los Angeles Police Department
taking SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN out of the area. At this point,
he unquestionably recognized SIRWAN ac the same man that he had

seen earlier attempting to pass through the doors in the area
of the ABC television cameras.

KLASE stated that during the time he was in the kitchen,
just prior to the arrival of Senator KENNEDY and the shooting
he noticed some of the cooks and waiters in the area, but did
not see SIRHAN BISHARA SITRHAN. KLASE further stated that
while he was in the kitchen area his wife remained in the main
portion of the Embassy Room and did not see SIRHAN BISHARA SZRHAN.

Mr, ALBERT ORFALEA, 4131 Adlon Place, Encino,
California, advised the following:

He stated his son, RICHARD ORFALEA, who had
attended the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign party
at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, on the evening of
June 4, 1968, and the a.m, of June 5, 1968, was not
residing in the Los Angeles area. He, at this time, was
in the Phoenix, Arizona area on a United States Air Force
Reserve two-week training program. RICHARD is scheduled

California, telephone (415) 771-7052, on August 12, 1968.
RICHARD is employed in the International Department of the
Bank of America in San Francisco,

Mr. ORFALEA said that on the basis of what
RICHARD had related following the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY, RICHARD had not actually observed the
shooting. There had been some speculation concerning
whether or not RICHARD had observed SIRHAN SIRHAN in the
Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel prior to the shooting.

Concerning the identity of DAVID ROCHE, who
reportedly had been in the company of RICHARD ORFALEA,
Mr. ALBERT ORFALEA said that he did not know DAVID ROCHE
by name or description but that RICHARD could possibly
identify DAVID ROCHE,

RICHARD ORFALEA, 455 Eddy Street, telephone 771-
7052, furnished the following information:

ORFALEA is presently a trainee in the International
Banking Department of the Bank of America and temporarily
assigned to the Columbus Branch of the Bank of America at
1455 Stockton Street, San Francisco.

On the night of June 4, 1968, following the
primary elections in the State of California, ORFALEA and a
friend, PATRICK MC LAUGHLIN, went to the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles, California, about 9:00 p.m. On that evening the
Ambassador Hotel was the location of victory celebrations
being held by the various successful candidates in the primary
elections.

During the course of the evening, ORFALEA and
MC LAUGHLIN visited several of the different celebrations
and were the recipients of a number of free drinks being
offered.

About 11:00 p.m. ORFALEA was in the Embassy Room
of the Ambassador Hotel, which was the scene of the victory
celebration of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. At that particular
time ORFALEA was alone and noticed a young man standing along
the side of the room off to the right of the speaker's plat-
form. This individual seemed out of place as he was dressed
shabbily and appeared to be of foreign extraction, possibly
Cuban. He was probably about 22 to 24 years of age, approxi-
mately 5'5" tall, had dark eyes, dark hair, and was of slight”
build. He was wearing a nylon-type jacket similar to a wind~-
breaker, but ORFALEA does not recall the color of the jacket.
MC LAUGELIN later joined ORFALEA in the Embassy Room; however,
he did not see the individual referred to by ORFALEA.

Sometime after Senator KENNEDY had finished speaking,
there was a commotion in the room, and ORFALEA heard someone
yell what he thoughtwas the word “fire"™. At this point
MC LAUGHLIN Suggested that they leave the Embassy B Room. They

ALAN. CRANSTON was having a victory celebration. Upon
entering this room they learned from conversation that some-
one had béen shot. MC LAUGHLIN suggested that they go over by
the telephone booths on the second floor as there would be
reporters congregating in that area and they might learn

who had been shot. They went to the telephone booths and
talked to an unknown reporter who told them Senator KENNEDY
had bean shot. About this time a security officer, who was
not a Los Angeles Police Officer, came by with a young boy

who appeared to have his hands handcuffed behind his back.
This. boy was of foreign extraction, short, and of slim build.
ORFALEA could furnish no further description of the individual.
At the time, ORFALEA was of the opinion this individual was
the same person he had seen earlier in the evening in the
Embassy Room and who appeared to be out of place. However,

he now is not sure that it was the same individual.

ORFALEA was shown three pictures of SIRHAN SIRHAN,
and after studying these pictures, stated that the strange
individual he saw in the Embassy Room about 11:00 p.m. on the
night of June 4, 1968, could possibly have been SIRHAN SIRHAN
but that he is rather hazy about the matter at this time and
cannot be certain.

Miss VALERIE SCHULTE, interviewed at her temporary
residence Apartment 3, 6587 Del Playa, furnished the following
information:

She was, during the past year a student, at University
of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). During this past spring,
she was Headquarters Manager of the Kennedy for President Head-
quarters in Isla Vista which is adjacent to the UCSB campus.

On the night of June 4, 1968, she, and others on the
staff, worked at the headquarters until about 8:00 P.M. and then
went to Los Angeles to join in the festivities at the Ambassador
Hotel where Senator KENNEDY had his headquarters on the fifth
floor. They arrived at the hotel at approximately 10:00 P.M. and
went to their rooms on the third floor of the hotel. After
partying" awhile, a couple of the girls in the group went to the
fifth floor to the KENNEDY headquarters and when they came down,
they heard that Senator KENNEDY was going to leave his room and
go to the ballroom on the first floor.

She, and several others, decided to go to the fifth
floor where they could get a look at Senator KENNEDY. They took
the elevator and when they arrived at the fifth floor and the
doors opened, a rush of reporters into the elevator kept them
from getting off. The reporters said that Senator KENNEDY had
gone down to the main floor so they stayed on the elevator and
went to the first floor. They then learned that Senator KENNEDY
had gone into the Embassy Room at the hotel to greet the crowd.
On the elevator she met DICK FRICK another member of the Isla
Vista group of workers. FRICK had a press pass and he went into
the Embassy Room with the press. She was not allowed in the room
as she did not have a pass.

Miss SCHULTE stated that she was on crutches from a
recent leg operation and did not want to get into the press of
the crowd as she had very poor balance and she was afraid of
getting knocked down and crushed. At the door of the Embassy
Room she saw Staté Senator BEILENSON and his wife. She recognized

them as she had met them before. They also could not get in
the Embassy Room, however, the security guard on the door told
them of another way into the room, This way was through the
back way and through a pantrv apparently somewhere near the
kitchen, She asked BEILENSON if she could 'tag along’ with him
and his wife.

She followed BEILENSON into the pantry and through a
door into the Embassy Room,which put them into the room about
four to five feet from the stage. There was a tremendous crowd
in the room and after listening to Senator KENNEDY speak she
decided that she should get out of the way before he left and
the crowd knocked her down. She then left the room and took a
position where she thought she would be able to see Mr. KENNEDY
and still be out of the middle of the crowd. She felt that he
would leave from the front of the stage and pass through two
lines of volunteer workers who appeared to be forming a passage-
way for him.

She left the room and went into one of the small rooms
just off the stage entrance. In a few moments she saw Mr. KENNEDY
about three to four feet from her. He apparentlyhad left the stage
by a different route than had been planned. Mr. KENNEDY was
leaving the Embassy Room via the back way, which was the way she
came into the room.

While Mr. KENNEDY was leaving | the room, he was talking
and shaking hands and she ‘tagged along'in the crowd behind. She
was about four to five feet from Mr. KENNEDY when she saw him
turn to either greet or shake hands with a group of kitchen
workers who were lined against the wall of the corridor. At
almost the same time she saw a gun in the hands of a man who
seemed to be reaching toward Mr. KENNEDY and pointing the gun at
him. She noted that it was a small gun, black in color, and
with a very short barrel. She thought at first it was a toy and
then she heard what she later learned were shots. She still
did not realize what was happening. She saw the gun and the man
holding it and he seemed to keep shooting and shooting. She was
not sure how many shots she heard but felt there must have been
at least six. She then realized there was shooting and felt that
someone was going to shoot everyone in the room. It appeared to
