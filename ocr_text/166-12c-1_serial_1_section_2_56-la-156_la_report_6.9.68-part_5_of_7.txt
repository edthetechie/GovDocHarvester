Senator KENNEDY gave his speech and standing near her was
an individual she described as a short male Mexican, about
20 years of age, whom she recognized from newspaper photographs
as SIRHAN SIRHAN.

FULMER stated that after the shooting, she ran out
of the main entrance of the ballroom yelling words to the
effect, "He shot him - he shot him." FULMER said she did not
actually see the shooting but was coming forward to give her

a@ot dress and was heard to yell, "We shot him - we shot him."

FULMER said she was not wearing a white polkadot
dress but did wear an orange and white polkadot scarf tucked

"On the night of June 4, 1968, I was on
official duty at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles
to take pictures of any violation of fire regulations,
This was done at the request of the Fire Prevention
Bureau.

"At around mid-night I was sitting across the
hall which runs along the north side of the Embassy
Room. I observed Senator Kennedy and his party
pass where I was sitting and go out of sight around
a door way and I believe that he had gone on into
the Embassy Room.

“There were several straglers following the
Senator's party. One of them came to my attention
due to the way he was looking from side to side as
though he was observing the layout of the area or
the people around the area. He was also carrying
what appeared to be a rolled up poster in his hands.
It appeared to be a roll about two feet long and
three to four inches in diameter. As I saw a rolled
up postey similar to the one I had previously seen
being held in the air in the hall, while the Senator
was apparently in the Embassy Room. Sometime later
the Senator's party was leaving the Embassy Room

"and moving down toward the Press Room at the énd of the hall.
T did not actually see Senator Kennedy at this time but

by the movement of the crowd I was under the impression

that he was in the group.

"T heard what sounded like three shots fairly close,
followed by several more at random intervals. They
sounded like they came from a cap pistol. I also saw
what appeared to be flashes from the shots. At this
time I had the impression of someone standing on a table
and firing a gun at a downward angle.

"T moved toward where this activity had happened and
learned that Senator Kennedy had been shot. I got my
camera and returned and began to take pictures. TI took
five pictures of the activity. I then learned that in
addition to Senator Kennedy, several others had been shot.
I also became aware that some of the commotion was caused
by several others subduing the person who apparently had
done the shooting.

"T later left the ambassador Hotel and went to Fire
Department Headquarters. Enroute I wondered whether the
person I had seen following the Senator's party with the
poster had been involved in the shooting. However, after
I arrived at Headquarters I heard a newscast that described
the suspect as possibly a Negro or Mexican man about 25
years of age. I recalled the person I had seen with the
poster as about that description but with a complexion too
light to be described as Negro or Mexican. The man I had
seen had a full head of black hair and he was wearing a
blue shirt or blue jacket and possibly dark trousers.

"T later saw newspaper pictures of the person charged
with the shooting and I felt that it was the same person I
had seen following Senator Kennedy and carrying the poster.

"The pictures I took showed several people struggling
with a man who apparently had done the shooting. One
picture showed Senator Kennedy on the floor surrounded by
people. The foot and a portion of the leg of one of the
other victims was also shown in the picture of Senator
Kennedy. One of the pictures only showed the backs of
some bystanders. Another picture showed a man standing
on a table next to the wall near where the Senator had been

shot. 4.78

879-9011, advised he is a student at Fullerton Junior
College. KLEIN stated that on the evening of June 4, 1968,
he was at the Ambassador Hotel when Senator KENNEDY was shot
and then furnished the following information:

KLEIN was standing with two of his friends outside
of the Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel right after
Senator KENNEDY had finished his victory speech. Approximately
a minute or so after Senator KENNEDY had left the Embassy
Room, a@ man came running out of the Embassy Room and shoved
people as he ran. This man was carrying a package under his
arm and the package was approximately three feet long and was
wrapped in some "blue stuff" possibly paper or cardboard.
KLEIN followed this individual out of the hotel, but upon
reaching the outside he lost him. KLEIN asked several people
if they observed a man running and they indicated not.

KLEIN stated the reason he followed this individual
was beceuse he was the first person to come running out of
the room and was carrying a package. Also PATTI NELSON, who
was with KLEIN stated she had seen a muzzle of a gun sticking
out of one end of the package. KLEIN himself did not see the
muzzle of a gun. Also a DENNIS WEAVER was with KLEIN and
NELSON and WEAVER did not see a muzzle of a gun.

KLEIN explained that last night, June 5, 1968, he
was watching the Channel 7 News at 5:30 p.m., that originated
from New York City. The news program showed a scene with
Senator KENNEDY walking out of the Embassy Room after making
his victory speech and the camera fanned out on the people
who were standing in the corridor outside of the room where
Senator KENNEDY was walking. The television camera stopped
on this individual and at this point KLEIN recognized the
same man he saw the previous night running out of the Embassy
Room after Senator KENNEDY had been shot. In the television
scene, this individual had a blue package in his hand. KLEIN
stated he would recognize this individual if he saw him again.

the following information:

NELSON, age 20, is a student at the University
of California at Irvine, majoring in Political Science.
She is the Orange County Coordinator of Students for KENNEDY.

At about 8:45 p.m., on June 4, 1968, NELSON
arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California, to partake in the contemplated
victory celebration there for Senator KENNEDY. The
Presidential primary elections were held in California on
June 4, 1968. At about 12:10 a.m., on June 5, 1968,
she was standing with JOSEPH THOMAS KLEIN, also known as
Tom Klein, in the lobby of the Ambassador Hotel, next
to a pillar just outside of the Embassy Room of this hotel.
There were hundreds of people in the lobby. All of a sudden
she observed a male individual running through the lobby
and heard him say twice, “Excuse me please". This individual
said nothing else. He came out of what appeared to be
the Embassy Room or a room very close to the Embassy Room.
Under his right arm this individual carried a package, which
was about three and one half feet long and about six inches
wide, wrapped in what appeared to be a dark blue canvas type
cloth. The front of the package was closed. It could well
have been a gun case. This package was held loosely in this
individual's right hand. What appeared to be a wooden stock
of a rifle or a shotgun protruded out of this blue canvas about
six inches. NELSON did not know the difference between a shot~
gun and a rifle. The wooden stock appeared to her to be of
oak or light walnut finish. She felt quite sure that the
wood that protruded from this blue canvas was definitely
the stock of a gun. She observed this individual for a
period of about five seconds and last saw him running down
the corridor of the hotel.

GUARD: Do you smoke cigars?

STRHAN:

Thank you, you are very generous.

ANOTHER GUARD: He wouldn't give you a cigar, he doesn't have
any. (Laughter)

; SIRHAN: What does a job like this pay?

GUARD: Well, let's see.

SIRHAN: You're an official.

GUARD: Well, Itm a policeman. I'm working in the jail system.
See, they have policemen out in the field in uniform, like in
a blue uniform. They have policemen in here, too.

SIRHAN: Is there any difference in pay?

GUARD: No, it's all the same. Different responsibilities,
of course, but it's all the same. As soon as you come on the
job, it's all the same. You know.

SIRHAN: =I like the mustache you have.

GUARD: Oh, it's been going about a week and a half now. I
have a blond reddish beard so it's going to be pretty wild.

SIRHAN: Don't shave it when you get it raised.

GUARD: I'm going to leave it long. I'm going on vacation in
July and I'm going to grow a full beard. I'm going to really
let myself go. Do you like to shave? I hate to shave.
SIRHAN: No. I hate to shave.

GUARD: It tears my face up all the time.

Entrance of other people. Exchange of greetings.

GUARD: Would you like to get cleaned up?

SIRHAN: Well, I don't look very presentab¥e.

GUARD: It's not a perfect fit.

LA 56-156

ANOTHER GUARD: It doesn't fit me.
SIRHAN: I wish you could accomodate me more.

GUARD: Did you get everything you needed? There, you look
better: Do you want your hair do?

SIRHAN: I think so.

GUARD: How's the leg?

SIRHAN: A little luke warm water. Help it a little.bit.
GUARD: Got a bad leg?

SIRHAN: When are we going to continue our discussion on
KIRSHKE?

GUARD: Yea, we were talking about KIRSHKE. How come you
followed that? I was interested to ask you.

SIRHAN: I .didn't foltow it. I was hoping you would clue me
in on it. You know, brief me in on it, you might say.

GUARD: It was a tough law suit. You'd have to know JACK.
As a deputy I worked with him, it's hard to....

SITRHAN: I mean the substance of the case.

GUARD: The substance, actually was whether or not he was the
guy that.... There is no question that his wife and friend of
hers got shot. There is no question about that. The question
is who did it. The jury resolved that it was JACK KIRSHKE.
It was a hard fought case and went a long time.

ANOTHER GUARD: How long did that case go?

GUARD: Gosh, it must have gone about four, five, or six
months, I think.

OTHER GUARD: Yea, at least that long from beginning to end.
Tt was tried by AL HARRIS, up in the Attorney General's Office.

LA 56-156

SIRHAN: How would the jury have reacte@ had KIRSHKE been...
not

GUARD: A District Attorney?

SIRHAN: Yeah, &@ District Attorney.

GUARD: It's hard to say. I think, myself, that they would
probably hold a District Attorney to a higher standard than
the ordinary citizen.

SIRHAN: You bet your boots!

GUARD: You bet. That's my guess.

SIRHAN: Would you... would you if you were in his shoes. How
would you react?

GUARD: It's hard to say.

SIRHAN: How about you, Mr. MULINDAS?

MULINDAS: It's hard to say. I don't know. You'd have to .
listen to the evidence and everything, testimony and everything.
How would you know? I'm not too conversive with that case. I
just followed it like an average layman; what I read in the
papers.

SIRHAN: What was your attitude, Mr. JORDAN?

JORDAN: You mean as a juror or as a citizen?

SIRHAN: As a juror or as a citizen?

JORDAN: As a citizen...

SIRHAN: A responsible citizen.

JORDAN: Thank you. I'll have to go along with..... and I'd
be inclined you'd hold somebody in that position to a stricter

accounting than you would on the everyday layman. I think it's
almost... 498


--- Page 26 ---
LA 56-156

SIRHAN: sccecoceess
JORDAN: Well, not necessarily.

SIRHAN: I mean a stereo type. As all District Attorneys.
They all want that umph. They want to grab it. And yet he
WAS ecrece

JORDAN: Retribution.

SIRHAN: Retribution, and the tables were turned you might say.
How did he really react, now? How would an average person,
supposing you were involved, how, exactly would you react;
when you are the prosecutor and you want the other man's

life, hungry and thirsty for his blood, and yet you are thrown
in his situation, that man's position, how would you want

the other-the man that's prosecuting you. How much would you
expect him to demand.

JORDAN: I don't know. Let me ask you this. How much do you
think?

SIRHAN: I asked the first’ question.

MULINDAS: Oh, I think everyone would expect inherently,
first of all, fairness and justice, beyond that what else
could you expect?

STRHAN: No favoritisin at all. Wouldn't you really... I mean
I felt bad myself, a little bit, that JACK KIRSHKE must have,
how should I say? In one way he must have supposing a
defendant was in fact innocent of the accusation of, what
ever you call it, and JACK KIRSHKE demanded his life as
restitution for his crime or whatever he did and he succeeded
in it. Wou you consider that a request for his life would in
some way recompence the innocent lives that he has requested.

JORDAN: What are you asking me?
SIRHAN: Huh?

JORDAN: What are you asking me?
499


--- Page 27 ---
LA 56-156

SIRHAN: Wouldn't you say that had his death now has his
decision been an issue?

JORDAN: His death penalty been imposed? Yes.

SIRHAN: Now, would you say that the death penalty is, in
fact, just and should be issued?

JORDAN: I didn't follow the case that much. I coukd not
say that as a matter.of opinion. I have no reason to believe
it is not just, not fair. Now, that is a matter of sematic,
now youtre asking if it's fair and proper. The question is
did he kill two people. If he killed two people, then is

it a proper sentence? Who knows?

SIRHAN: He is wondering what I am thinking. I was following
your line of thought.

JORDAN: It's hard to Isnow other people. You know where you
are now? I've told you've been...you are in custody. You've
been booked. You understand what I've been....

SIRHAN: I have been before a Magistrate, have I or have I
not?

JORDAN: No, you have not. You will be taken before a Magistrate
as soon as possible. Prebably will’ bé tried.... I get you
up there if worse comes to worse....

SIRHAN: .eeoesecs

JORDAN: You'll be properly attired. This is an interrogation
room, I think it's room, one, isn't fe? sMhat's ccrrect. ‘You're
downtown Los Angeles in the Central Jail, the Central Jail

in Parker Center. Now when I say this, I'm saying.... we're
not communicating very well up to now; but you are downtown

Los Angeles, okay? This is the main jail for the LAPD. You!11
be booked...I don't know exactly where and I don't warit to

know where, but it will be around here. Do you understand
that? Do you understand where you are?

SIRHAN: You said it. 500

LA 56-156

JORDAN: OK? I mean you know where L.A, is and all those
things. OK? So far?

SIRHAN: So far...KIRSHKE.

JORDAN: Now, besides KIRSHKE, what else can we talk about?
SIRHAN: KIRSHKE that's all I want...

JORDAN: Really? Did you read about it or are you seem ----
did you know any of the parties in it?

SIRHAN: No, I told you I observed it seemingly. Very fleetingly
on television.

JORDAN: Yeah. They had a lot of publicity. A hard loss.
SIRHAN: You're a good man, Mr, JORDAN,

JORDAN: I don't know about that,

SIRHAN: How do you mean?

JORDAN: Well...

SIRHAN: If a person doesn't know himself, sir, really...
JORDAN: Well, OK, I think I am.

SIRHAN: Beautiful...How about you, Mr. MULINDAS, do you got
any children, family, or...

MULINDAS:. I have children, how about you? Uh?

SIRHAN: Do you plan to train them in this business of
prosecution?

MULINDAS?: No, they're girls.

SIRHAN: Oh. They wouldn't become good juries and judges, can they
MULINDAS:: Yes. They could,

SIRHAN: Do you think she will make it again?

MULINDAS: Yes.
SIRHAN: Why?

MULINDAS: Because last time I heard, she was ahead in the
voting.

SIRHAN: I like her, that lady. She is a little one, no? ‘The
little mini-skirt type of a girl.

JORDAN: If I was going to call you something, what would I call
you? GEORGE, PETE, or what? ;

SIRHAN: FRANK...

JORDAN: Officer FRANK MULINDAS,

SIRHAN: No, not this one.

JORDAN: No, he means the young nephew FRANK,
SIRHAN: And I introduced myself as JOHN DOE.
MULINDAS: Did you?

JORDAN: I think I gave him a clue to that, You like the
name JOHN DOE?

SIRHAN: Oh, it's nice, for one thing.

JORDAN: Gee, I would have thought of something more exotic
than JOHN DOE,

SIRHAN: Well, really, I think...

MULINDAS: How about RUDOLPH VALENTINO...
SIRHAN: I think HUMPHREY is very exotic myself.
MULINDAS: HUMPHREY?

STRHAN: Yeah, or MURPHY or whatever it is.
JORDAN: We got out list of names.

JORDAN: It rolls off the tongue easily. All in? SIRHAN, what
do you mean? Tired?

SIRHAN: Inherently, inherently. Tell me how would you judge

a man who is inherently lazy and yet so thriving. and wanting

to be on the job to impress his superiors...

JORDAN: Why not?

SIRHAN: (Unintelligible) and yet this guy claims and professes
to be inherently lazy. He should go out and exercise - you have

MULINDAS: Let's be friendly and manly for a second, we have a
job to do. You understand this, don't you? I'm Sergeant
MULINDAS and this is Sergeant JORDAN and you have been talking
to Mr. HOWARD. Now, do you want to talk to us about the
incident at the Ambassador or don't you? Were you at the
Ambassador tonight?

SIRHAN: Mr. JORDAN and Mr. MULINDAS, I must act right and say
that when he informed me of my constitutional rights, the first
thing that he said was that I have the right to remain.....
MULINDAS: This is correct, this is absolutely correct,

SIRHAN: This is basic American U.S. jurisprudence,

MULINDAS: But we have to leave here at least ask you if you want
to talk to us about the incident,

JORDAN: You have to give up your right without force, if you
want, that's your choice. That's choice, no one else in the world
can make it.

MULINDAS: We're talking man to man now to you. Mr. JORDAN, as
a legitimate law enforcement officer, advised you of your
constitutional rights, Now you have the right to give up these
rights if you want to talk to us; talk to us if this is your
privilege. Now do you want to talk to us about the incident
tonight? Won't you at least give us your name?

SIRHAN: I thought that you had my name?

JORDAN; JOHN DOE,

SIRHAN: JOHN DOE,

MULINDAS: Now what is your real name?

SIRHAN: (Unintelligible)

MULINDAS: Now here is where we come down to JOHN, whatever your
name is -----

SIRHAN: DOL.

LA 56-156

MULINDAS: All right, JOHN DOE, When it comes right down to it,
some point of time you may want to make a statement, that has to
be up to you. You had your rights explained to you. You've
been here now for some time to try and talk to you to find

out if you want to talk to us. Now I'll leave you our numbers.
We would like to talk to you tonight, we would like to bring a
stenographer in here, take down reported statement, your
statement, as to what occurred within the last four hours before
you came here. That's what we would like to do. You have

no obligation to make that statement.

STRHAN: I'm no movie star, and want all much work, Jesus Christ.
MULINDAS: Fine, that's good enough for me. OK, if you decide
you don't want to change your mind, you have our names and you
can reach us.

SIRHAN: What time is it, Mr. JORDAN?

JORDAN: It's 20 minutes to 4,

SIRHAN: I'm allowed 72 hours tefore I'm brought before a
magistrate, no?

MULINDAS: Maximum is 48,
SIRHAN: 48, well -----
MULINDAS: It's court days.

SIRHAN: Court day, you have that many hours minus before I'm
brought before the magistrate,

MULINDAS: Right, that's correct.

OTHER VOICE: I'll talk the guy out there and see if they have
any smaller pants, OK.

SIRHAN: Thank you.
MULINDAS: He's slender, that kind of hurts me.

OFFICER; Where did you get those pants?

SIRHAN: How do you like that, new style, huh? They'd fit
you, JOHN, won't it.

OFFICER: Huh?

STRHAN: I don't know if they would fit me or not.
ANOTHER OFFICER: You want me to take another one?
SIRHAN: A couple that runs around here just might do it.

OFFICER: I think I got you outweighed a little bit too much
for even those, huh.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You want me to take another one now, or...
SIRHAN: Really, I couldn't finish the other one, I...

ANOTHER OFFICER: I don't want to talk to you about the case, OK?
SIRHAN: Wonderful, wonderful.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You said something that interested me and I
want to come...

SIRHAN: Please.
ANOTHER OFFICER: ...About Mr. KIRSHKE, OK,

SIRHAN: Surely, surely, I'm always up, you know, I'll hear anybody.
I'm a good listener, but a hell of a lousy talker,

ANOTHER OFFICER: Lousy talker.
SIRHAN: Don't talk about it.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, I want to ask you, you obviously had some
knowledge of the KIRSHKE case...

SIRHAN: No, like I said...

ANOTHER OFFICER: ...Superficial, you sound like you have had
as much as I have, and I don't have too much, that part
interested me, too. Do you feel - you said something about
Mr, KIRSHKE prosecuted innocent people. Now, is that just a
figure of speech, or do you have some feeling...

SIRHAN: No, it wasn't a figure of speech, you know, how you
read a book, a novel, where, how in the hell can I give you a,
oh, take the movie or the book "Phe Mockingbird" or "To Kill

A Mockingbird", I don't remember the exact details of this
thing, but there was an innocent Negro involved in or against a
murder or some crime, and yet they succeed in revenging him and
killing him.

LA 55-156

ANOTHER OFFICER: I'll be real honest. I don't remember,
STRHAN: I don't remember either, but I know where there was
some support so that the guy that wanted to ball him...the
prosecutor, the way ne performed. Is this being bugged in?
Are you bugging me?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Yeah, sure. You know that.

OFFICER: Sure, you know that.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Now if that kills anything, as I say, I'm
not talking about the case,

SIRHAN: No. I mean hell, if you want to tape me bring the
(obscene) mike here, don't, don't play this (obscene) with
me.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Wo we're not playing (obscene) with you.
That's just routine. Everything in the whole building, so
we're not trying to nide anything.

OFFICER: Would you rather that we didn't tape it?

SIRHAN: It's not the taping, you know, it's a....

OFFICER: Would it make any difference if the recorder was
set on the....

SIRHAN: I'd feel more safe then, the way I'd feel more safe.
OFFICER: The same thing is going 6n the tape whether it's

the tape sitting in front of you or it's going through the
sound lab upstairs.

ANOTHER OFFICER: In fact, we'd have trouble scraping up the....
STRHAN: Hello there!

ANOTHER OFFICER: Facilities to bring it in here because as IL
say it was built in that way, you know.

515


--- Page 43 ---
LA 56-156

SIRHAN: Yeah, yeah.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, we won't lie to you, anything you want
to know you just ask, we're not going to lie to you.

OFFICER: I'm curious about your interest in KIRSHKE case.
SIRHAN: No, really. There is no, when the District Attorney
up there, Mr. HOWARD, he introduced himself as HOWARD, he
said he was a District Attorney.

OFFICER: Deputy District Attorney.

SIRHAN: Oh! Deputy District Attorney. See, he did not
write that on the paper.

ANOTHER OFFICER: 1 am an investigator for the District
Attorney's Office and JORDAN is Sergeant.

OFFICER: He knows more about me than IT know about him, that's
for sure.

ANOTHER OFFICER: I'm retired from the Los Angeles Police
Department.

STRHAN: Congratulations on that.

ANOTHER OFFICER: I retired and went to work for the District
Attorney's Office about three years ago, and he asked me
about KIRSHKE. I never knew him. I never had a case with
nim all the time I was on tne Police Department.....I never
had a case with him.

OFFICER: I think that I had one.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Here is a guy who prosecuted a lot of cases,
turns around, he get prosecuted ever since.

SIRHAN: This was the main thing that I was trying to under-

stand, you know. You know hearing it from television is
always for public appeal, mass appeal.

516


--- Page 44 ---
LA 55-156

ANOTHER OFFICER: I agree with it.

SIRHAN. But you know, hearing it first hand from the in,
you know, the inside, is wnat really aroused my interest
in the whole thing, when ne said that, wnen he introduced
himself as a member of the District Attorney's Department,
but there was no other interest in it.

JORDAN: One thing about it our business will always be
good, We are never lacking for business.

OFFICER: Recessions, we never suffer from recessions.

SIRHAN: You know tnose church goers are just as black
hearted as cen be, nuh?

OFFICER: No, I would never make a....

STRHAN: No, I didn't say that you the force. Just last
Sunday I was hearing a religious report on the radio, that
the church and medicine in the United States is rocketing.
Boom! You know it's the highest in the country and you
counteract it with saying that jail sentence is the .......

OFFICER: Our population is going up, too. Population has
gone way up, so church attendance goes up. Your population
goes up, your crime goes ud.

SIRHAN: Explain that.

OFFICER: Well, everything is going up. I mean if population...

SIRHAN: As a person, I see what you mean.

OFFICER: Sure. It's all relative. In other words, we

start with one hundred people and let's say fifty per cent
are church goers and five der cent are criminals. Well,

the percentage might remain the same but with more people,

we talk about 5,000 people, the nercentage is still the same
but the numbers are increasing on both sides. I thing that's
all Mr, MURPHY means.

STRHAN: That figures, prooortionally. You should be a
broker, Mr. ........

OFFICER: I ama broker. I'm broke all the time.

SIRHAN: Yeah, he wouldn't listen. I'd flind a broker and you
unow a mortgage broiler, how could he go broke? You know
every transaction has got to make a profit.

OFFICER: That's right. That's why the stoci market is a
pretty good business to be in.

SIRHAN: You know your business. Isn't bad either. You get
a few convictions once in a while.

OFFICER: Yeah.
SIRHAN: That keeps up the incentive.

OFFICER: Gee now, that's where you interest me. You thin
that our only interest in convictions, now you really mean
that sincerely or?

STRHAN: Well, like I said. This KIRSHKE business, it's like
that. Boom, boom, boom, boom, you know he wWaS .......

OFFICER: He was an agrcssive prosecutor.

SIRHAN: I don't know. I don't know his personality. I mean
his proceedure. TI don't know anything about the man really
put you know any prosecutor is expected to be up there and
agressive and willing to bet you know, the best, the most

he can throw at it. But whether he gets it or not is not
really his decision in the long run, you know eventually.

OFFICER: No. What are you supposed to do. Prosecutor is
supposed to put the case and do the best he can. If he loses,
he loses. He wins, he wins. This isn't a type of business
that you take home witn you. If it were, you would be a
raving maniac.

SIRHAN: How do you mean?

OFFICER: Well, I mean you can't. I° yeu get a case and
you're not able to solve it, if you let it bug you, worry
about it and relive with it, it's going to drive you crazy.
It's a job. You do the best you can. If you're successful,
fine. If you've not successful, you're not supposed to.

In other words, it isn't your whole life, twenty-four hours
a day, where you are just dedicated to doing something.

SIRWAN: But I thought...
OFFICER: You have give and take a little bit ov otherwise...

SIRSAN: As I understand it. Correct me if I'm mistaken.
now, I thought you said that you said it in passing that you
got to live with it M:. MONAGAL (phonetic). How do you
relate that living with it, you know, with Leaving it in the
office and when you go home you ignore it?

OFFICER: I'm talking about doing a good job. Dong a good
job. Doing a just job. Thet's what you got to live with.
You got to live with your conscience. In other words, if
you get a case on somebody and you try to make a case on an
innocent person, this is the sort of thing you got to live
with. ho can live with something like that on their
conscience?

SIRSAN: Well, it depends on you know, unscrupulous.
Blood thirsty District Attorwney or any, anyone down...

OFFICER: And you listen to a lot of people and they give
the idea that law enforcement as a whole axe all like tnat.
But in fact that's not true.

SIRHAN: Then are you trying to win my sympathy, now?
OFFICER: No, Tim trying to state some fact to you. I
don't know. I may be iwistaken but I so-t of nave a feeling

that you don't completely trust us that we would be honest
with you that you're going to get a fair...

Well, did you hear, tonight was it, recently, that
there has been oh, they called the jury system in
United States unfair?

The death penalty?

No, the jury system, the selection of the jury; you
know in that part.

For death penalty cases, that's what they were talking
about.

No, no, no, this was just very recently that being a
velative of so and so and the smartness of the lawyers
in selecting just the right kind of jury and dismissing
this kind of guy and that, not necessarily with this
death deal, not the Supreme Court stand.

dust the jury system as a whole.

No, the KFWB broadcaster, they criticized something

about the jury system. Oh no, it was an advertise-

ment for Newsweek an article about the jury system,

that really interested me I heard about it, I didn't
read it you know.

In Newsweek, it probably said the system was archaic
and outmoded and medieval and so forth, I read Newsweelc
and I can and everbody sets a tone, what do you think
about the jury system?

JORDON, you have a phone call.
Excuse me.
Yes sir.

You know, they can criticize the jury system but until
they can come up with something better, it's not bad
when you look around some of these other countries their
type of justice I'd prefer what we got here to what we
have got in some of the other parts of the world.

Well, again, I agree with you, really, you just can't
say. .
You picked up 12 people and you've got a better chance
than one or some of these countries, I wouldn't want to
get hooked up in type of justice.

Well, justice is justice, really, what is justice
other than being? Straight, simple and pure and just,
the word justice itself puzzles me sometimes, what is
it.

Fair play.

But would you consider well, again, lets pursue it
further, what is fair play?

of anybody.
