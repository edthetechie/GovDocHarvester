PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES are out to get
Votes. and some of them do not realize their own
Inconsistencies,

__Tust the other day, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of
New Yor< made a speech in Los Angeles which
certain’ was received with favor by Protestant,
Cathol: and Jewish groups which have been
staunchly supporting the cause of Israel against
Egypt and the Arab countries.

Kennedy said: “We cannot — and will not —
permit the Soviet Union to achieve an imbalance
in the Middle East. We can and will fully assist
israel — with arms if necessary — to meet the
threat of massive Soviet military buildups. We
cannot — and will not — render Israel defense-
less in the face of aggression."

But during the Jast three years, on the other
hand. the Soviet Union has been sending muni-
tions to North Vietnam as well as bombing planes
and other weapons of war mounting to a total of
at least a billion dollars a year. Yet no demand
has been made by any of the presidential candi-
dates that economic sanctions be taken against
the Soviet Union and other Communist countries.

States should use its Power during internatiol
crises “only as a strategic reserve against @
most serious of threats." He adds:

“Vietnam is only Vietnam. It will not settle
the fate of Asia or America — much less the fate
of the world.”

Lats of people, however, think the situation in
the Middle East is not nearly as dangerous as the
sittation in Southeast Asia; Also there are many
members of Congress who feel that, if it is proper
for the United States to render military support
to Israel in the Middle East, it is just as neces-
sary to protect the countries of Southeast Asia
against aggression, .

Sen, Kennedy, in a speech in Portland, Ore.,
last month, criticized the administration's atti-
tude even more severely when he said:

“American foreign policy has become identi-
fied with power, and in that obsession we have
forgotten our purposes. . . *

\

“Ry the unilateral exercise of our overwhelm-
ing ‘er, we isolated ourselves, To many of our
tradifional allies and neutral friends, we behaved
ws apuperpower ignoring our own historical com-
mitngent to a decent respect for the opinions of
mankind.”

Kennedy, in his speech on Monday, neverthe-
less recommended a stem in the Middle
East and favored aid to Israel “with arms if nec-
essary'’ to meet the threat of the Soviets.

*

OPPOSITION to the war in Vietnam hag been
expressed by presidential candidates appealing to
voters who are fearful that their sons may be
drafted or to the families of those young men who
are already in the Armed Forces of the United
States in Southeast Asia. A large number of peo-
ple in this country are deeply concerned with the
events in the Middle East, particular pith the
fate of Israel. Hence the political cai
a hig advantage in proclaiming their firm:support
of American intervention in the Middle East.

-President Jfohnson, in announcing that he
would not accept nomination for re-election, had
hoped to take the Vietnam issue out of the cam-
paign. but foreign policy seems to have remained
an issue in the speeches by the two Nemocratic
candidaics, Sen. Kemmedy of New York and Sen.
Eugene NeCarthy of Minnesota.

Sergeant WILLIAM JORDAN, Los Angeles Police
Department, Rampart Detectives, advised SA ROBERT H. CLAUDIUS
on June 6, 1968, that the arraignment of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN took place at approximately 7:00 a.m., on June 5,
1968, in Division 40, Los Angeles County Municipal Court.
SIRHAN was booked and arraigned under the name of
"JOHN DOE", He was charged with six counts of Section 217 PC,
assault with intent to murder. Judge JOAN DEMPSEY KLEIN
set bail at $250,000 and this bail will take effect upon
the proper identification of the defendant. At the time
of the arraignment, SIRHAN was actually held without
bail due to the fact that his identity was not known and
therefore the terms of bail did not apply.

Sergeant JORDAN stated that it was his understanding
the Los Angeles County District Attorney planned to
present the case to the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on
Friday, June 7, 1968. He said if the indictment was
immediately forthcoming, there would be no preliminary
hearing for the subject.

Inspector RALPH C. WELCH, Officer in Charge,
Los Angeles County Jail, advised that SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN is confined to an eight foot by ten frat
hospital room located on the second floor of the Hospital
Section of the Los Angeles County Central Jail. This room
contains no windows and has a single steel door which has
a 12 inch by 12 inch glass window, which permits an outside
guard to view the room. The room contains an eight inch
high welded steel bed, which is secured solidly to
the floor. The bed contains a foam rubber mattress, blankets,
and a pillow. The room contains a commode and a 12 inch
by 16 inch tempered glass mirror. Located near the commode
and affixed to the wall, is an 18 inch by 16 inch steel
shelf, which contains coat hooks. The room also contains
a wash basin, towel bar, and a steel toilet paper
fixture, which is also affixed solidly to the wall.

Inspector WELCH advised that logs are being maintained
during SIRHAN's incarceration at this institution, as well as
medical reports.

Inspector WELCH advised that SIRHAN is currently
wearing a prison issued pair of pajamas and that no toilet
articles are permitted in the cell except on the request of
STRHAN. WELCH further stated that there is no electronic
device in SIRHAN's cell nor will one be installed. WELCH
stated SIRHAN will be fed the standard hospital menu three
times a day, selected at random from meals provided all
inmates. The only occasion on which he will leave his room
under escort will be for the purposes of receiving medical
attention and for showers.

WELCH stated that when SIRHAN arrived at the
Los Angeles County Central Jail he was immediately examined
by Dr. PHILLIP ATTALLA and this examination included a
head to toe-X-ray. He said it was noted during the
examination that SIRHAN was suffering from a fractured finger,
which was immediately splinted and an ace bandage applied to
his swollen ankle,

During the day, SIRHAN requested and received single
copies of the "Los Angeles Times" and the "Herald-Examiner".

Inspector WELCH further advised a jail guard
constantly surveils SIRHAN through a glass window in the
cell door throughout the period SIRHAN is confined alone.

He stated the only exception to this procedure is when

SIRHAN is visited by a person, physician or his attorney,

at which time the guard checks via the window at five minute
intervals. He further stated anyone visiting SIRHAN's

cell, including his attorney, must first have the approval

of Sheriff PETER PITCHESS. Under no circumstances will

SIRHAN be brought to an interview area of the Jail, for security
reasons.

WELCH advised no complications other than the fractured
finger and swollen ankle were noted during the examination of
SIRHAN by Dr. ATTALLA. Further, there were no indications that
SITRHAN had been using any form of narcotic and Dr. ATTALLA
has advised that there was no indication of any form of narcotic
withdrawal. Inspector WELCH stated that in his conversation
with SIRHAN on June 5, 1968, he found him to be very articulate
in speech with very little discernable accent.

SA NORBERT R. LINKER accompanied Inspector RALPH C.
WELCH, Lieutenant RAYMOND LLOYD and Lieutenant RICHARD WALLACE
to the second floor hospital cell occupied by SIRHAN. Prior
to viewing SIRHAN through the glass window, Inspector WELCH
opened an adjoining unoccupied room in order to permit
SA LINKER to view the room's facilities which are identical
to those in SIRHAN's cell. This inspection coincided in
every respect with the description of the room as previously
related by Inspector WELCH. The bed and steel shelf, toilet
paper fixture, basin and tempered glass mirror were all
firmly affixed to the wall and floor.

On completing inspection of the room adjoining
that of SIRHAN's, Inspector WELCH permitted SA LINKER to view
SIRHAN through the glass window leading into his room. It
was observed by SA LINKER that SIRHAN was lying face up on
his bed relaxing. It was also noted that his left index
finger was heavily bandaged with splint protruding from the
end. Also noted was an ace bandage wrapped around SIRHAN's
left ankle. This cell’ was identical to the above cell inspected
by SA LINKER.

SA LINKER observed a unifermedDeputy Sheriff positioned
on a high stool immediately outside SIRHAN's room which
affords him constant surveillance of SIRHAN while he is in the
room. Inspector WELCH advised that a guard will be maintained
at the window of SIRHAN's cell during the period he is
confined to the Los Angeles County Central Jail.

Inspector WELCH made available to SA LINKER a
copy of the institute menu for its inmates for the period
dune 5 - 9, 1968. He pointed out that in an effort to
prevent the possibility of poisoning SIRHAN while confined
he has assigned Deputy Sheriff personnel to proceed down the
prison mess line and at random select the food to be given
to SIRHAN thus preventing a regularly assigned tray to be
delivered to him. He also advised that SIRHAN will be
utilizing a spoon as a utensil instead of a fork.

SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was arraigned in Department
100 of Los Angeles County Superior Court, before Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge ARTHUR L. ALARCON, in proceedings
which commenced 5:48 p.m., June 7, 1968. The proceedings were
held in the Chapel Facility of the new Los Angeles County Jail,
441 Bauchet Street, Los Angeles, California. Judge ALARCON
announced that the reasons for holding the proceedings in that
facility were two-fold:

1. Because of the defendant's physical condition.
2. To insure appropriate security.

The indictment against SIRHAN was read by Deputy
District Attorney JOHN E. HOWARD, Los Angeles County District
Attorney's Office. SIRHAN was represented by WILBUR L.
LITTLEFIELD, Chief Trial Deputy for the Los Angeles County.
Public Defender's Office. Also present in court at the
specific request of Judge ALARCON, was A, L. WIRIN, a
representative of the American Civil Liberties Union. WIRIN
conferred with SIRHAN prior to arraignment at the request of
SIRHAN.

Defender LITTLEFIELD requested the Judge to order an
examination of SIRHAN by two psychiatrists, which was approved
by the court. This psychiatric examination was for the benefit
of the defense only, and the court ordered that the examining
doctors not divulge the results of their findings to anyone
other than the defense. At the request of the defense counsel,
Judge ALARCON fixed date of June 28, 1968, at 9:00 a.m., for
plea and further proceedings.

The defendant was observed being brought into
the Chapel Facility in a wheel chair. It was also
observed that the defendant left the Chapel Facility in
a wheel chair.

ANDREW WEST stated that after Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY and his wife, ETHEL KENNEDY, left the stage he
followed them to ask additional questions, but Senator ROBERT
F, KENNEDY was out of his sight for a short time after he left
the stage. ANDREW WEST stated that after Senator ROBERT F,
KENNEDY left the stage, he proceeded to a small anteroom and
hallway behind the stage of the Embagsy Room at the Ambassador
Hotel, and at this time he was trotting to catch up with
Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, ANDREW WEST stated that as he
reached the hallway behind the stage and turned right, he
saw Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, his wife ETHEL KENNEDY, and a
number of campaign supporters and news media people immediately
in front of him, ANDREW WEST stated that he started through
the group of people in the direction of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY,
ANDREW WEST stated as he approached Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY he
heard noises which sounded like gun shots, and at that time he
instinctively turned on his tape recorder. ANDREW WEST stated
that at the time he did not know, for a fact, that the sounds
were gun shots, because people had been exploding balféens and
the sounds were similar. However, on this occasion, he did
notice that the sounds he had heard did not sound the same as
the balloons he had previously heard exploding. ANDREW WEST
stated he also believes he heard a woman scream at this time.
ANDREW WEST stated that at this time he was approximately four
or five feet away from Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY and was directly
in front of him with a number of people between himself and -Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY, ANDREW WEST stated he then heard a woman
scream "KENNEDY has been shot" or "The Senator has been shot",
or words to that effect, and he then saw a man lying on the

but the man did look familiar. ANDREW WEST stated that he then
noticed a second man lying on the floor a short distance away,
and he went to the area of the ¢econd man who was lying on the
floor and saw it was Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and he observed

blood oozing from the back of his head. ANDREW WEST stated

that after he saw it was Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY on the

floor, he immediately realized that someone wag in the area
with a gun, and he etarted looking for him. ANDREW WEST

gtated that he then noticed two men grappling with a third

man within approximately six or eight feet of where Senator
ROBERT F,. KENNEDY was lying on the floor. ANDREW WEST stated
that he had seen these men grappling almost immediately after

he had first identified Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY as one of the
two men lying wounded on the floor. ANDREW WEST stated that in
connection with his observation of the men grappling, he saw a
hand with a pistol in it, and he saw another hand, which was
wrapped around the hand holding the pistol. ANDREW WEST stated
that he then went in the direction of the pistol and he saw
ROOSEVELT GRIER holding a man, and he then noticed that the

gun was pointing at him. ANDREW WEST stated that he then pulled
away and also told people in the general area to get away from
the gun. ANDREW WEST stated that at about the same time he
recognized a person he believed to be RAFER JOHNSON holding on
to the hand holding the gun. ANDREW WEST stated that he then saw
that the pistol had been taken away from the man holding it, and
when he saw that the gun was broken away from the hand holding
it, he turned his direction elsewhere and left the room. ANDREW
WEST stated that at that time he was satisfied that help was on
its way for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY and that the assailant had
been arrested. ANDREW WEST stated that he was unable to describe
the assailant or furnish any descriptive data relative to him.
ANDREW WEST stated that the reason he was unable to describe the
assailant was becauge he had concentrated his entire attention
on the pistol and the activity relative to taking the pistol
away from whomever was holding it. ANDREW WEST stated that he
noticed only one man, although he had looked for additional
people who could be with the assailant, and he had only seen this
one man holding the pistol.

didn't really realize that the shot was a shot

"T was leading the party, and was on the Senator's
right, about one step in front. After about fifteen
feet inside the pantry door, I sensed the Senator was
not as close as when we started into the pantry. I
turned to my left, and observed the Senator shaking
hands with hotel employees on his left. My partner,
Karl Uecker, was on the Senator's left, and about
one or two steps in front of him. While the Senator
was shaking hands I saw out of the right corner of my
eyes someone darted behind my partner, and reached
around him, with a gun in his right hand. Before I
could react, he fired two shots. My partner grabbed
the gunman in a headlock, and I grabbed him around the
waist, and forced him up against a steam table, We
could not control his gun hand until after he fired
a number of shots in rapid succession. A number of
the Senator's party helped us to subdue the man and take
the gun away. I saw Rafer Johnson put the gun in his
pocket,

"At this point I ran to the room-service telephone
and called for an ambulance and the police. As I ran
to the phone, I noticed the Senator lying on the floor
with his head in a pool of blood and his eyes shut.
One of the bus-boys, Juan Romero, kneeling down by
the Senator. When I returned from the phone, approxi-
mately one minute later, I noticed that the Senator's
eyes were open, and that there were many more people
in the immediate area. I returned to where the gun-
man was being held down, and remained there until
the Los Angeles Police arrived to take custody of
the gunman. While there, I heard Rafer Johnson ask
the man repeatedly, 'Why did you do it, why did you
do it?' The man looked at me and said, ‘Let me
explain, I can explain." At this point someone
told him to shut up. Within approximately ten
minutes the police arrived and took custody of
the man, Uecker and I escorted the police to the
Wilshire entrance, and then returned to the pantry,
and by the time we got there the Senator and others
who had been shot had been taken away by ambulance.

arranging an interview to determine how his business card came
into possession of the police in connection with a search of

he is a staff writer and photographer for the Los Angeles Times

the Los Angeles Office of the FBI to furnish any information

fraternity at USC--they were Mare Dubin and David Druker.-~--I
had been watching the primary on television at the fraternity
and had decided to to the Kennedy headquarters when it
became apparent that the Senator was going to win the
Calif. Primary. I wanted to shoot some pictures of the
Senator for my own personal reasons. I am A Democrat and
had voted for the senator.

"When the three of us arrived I quickly determined
that the Press had a better vantage point and I told the
boys that I would meet them outside the press room after
the Senator had made his victory speech. I went inside
and talked with Times photographer Steve Fontanini and
reporter Paul Houston.--I saw some people going through
the kitchen door from the Press Room as if something was
going on, and I checked and observed the Senator coming out
from the ballroom. I went back and told Steve Fontanini
if he wanted a picture of Kennedy he had better hurry--we
both went into the kitchen corridor area and were too

ambassador again that night.--I went into the main
ballroom and worked as close to the front of the podium
as possible..I made eight to ten pictures~-which satisfied
me --then went back into the kitchen area in hopes of
getting a closeup as Kennedy left.--while there I talked
with Richard Drew, a friend of mine who is a staff

When Kennedy came back I aimed my camera but he was
moving so quickly that I missed him.

"Drew made the comment 'Hey Boris, you missed him.!
So I ran to catch up with the senator when he stopped at
the corridor junction to shake hands with some people.
Iwas about three feet behind and to the right of him
and was trying to find his head in my camera view finder
when I heard what I thought were two (2) explosions.
My first thought was 'some jerk has thrown some fire
crackers in here.!

"all of a sudden the two or three people that had
peen blocking my view of the Senator disappeared leaving
me with a full view of what was happening.

"The senator and the assailant were little more than
silhouettes but the senator was backing up and putting
poth of his hands and arms in front of him in what would
be best described as a protective effort. The suspect
appeared to be lunging at the senator, I don't know which
hand the gun was in--I didn't realize it was a gun until
he started firing again--this time I could see the flashes
from the short barreled muzzled-~-I heard no sounds from
either man. I felt powder from the weapon strike my face--
I knew it was a gun then. I thought I had heard three
shots, in retrospect I know it is more, however.---

"All of a sudden the firing stopped and some men jumped
the suspect and there were cries of get him, get the gun,--
much shouting.

"I must have moved closer to the suspect when all of a
sudden he was being flattened on the freezer table by two

"caucasions-~-~-I saw the suspects hand reach toward the
weapon and I grabbed the gun and had it almost immediately
yanked out of my hand by one of the men holding the
suspects left hand.--I looked to see who it was--The

man was a caucasion--6 feet or taller, with sandy hair,
green business suit and I think a white shirt and tie.--
My attention then shifted to the Senator--who was slumping
to the floor--blood on his face--I began to take pictures--~-
I shot 5 pictures~-but was interrupted by a panic stricken
woman who kept telling me ‘don't take pictures.' I remarked
to her ‘Lady, this is history.' however she kept pulling
on my arm (my right arm--So I shoved her into the wall

and kept shooting  more--

"As I watched the senator through my viewfinder I saw
that he was badly hurt. I saw a large amount of blood
drain from his right ear.--At this point I ran back to
the press room in an attempt to notify our paper which
was rapidly approaching a deadline.

"None of the phones that I tried in the press room
would work so I ran into the main hallway and found David
Druker, one of the two boys I had brought with me, still
outside.--I told him that Kennedy had been shot, to find
Mare and lets get the film down to the Times.

"He came with me until I found a telephone, a pay booth
behind some folding mirrors in the Cranston headquarters.--
I told him I would wait there until he brought mare dubin
back..-

"They appeared about two minutes later and we ran out
the back entrance to the hotel--to where I had parked the
car which was on Eighth St. right across from the driveway
to the hotel's parking lot.---

"As we were running out of the parking lot closest
to the hotel a LAPD sgt arrived with red lights on.--I
waved at him to stop and told him Senator Kennedy had
been shot--Then continued my run to the car--I shouted at
the parking lot attendent to keep ‘the driveway open for
an ambulance.!--~

"T ran every red light, stopping first I must add,
on my way downtown to The Times.--

"T have seen photographs of the suspect held in the
shooting of Senator Kennedy and can definately identify
him as the person who was shooting the Senator in the
Ambassador Hotel early in the morning of June 5, 1968.

"To my knowledge I have never seen this man before
hearing the explosions of the pistol shots and have had
no contact, whatever, with him.

"RE: Yaro business card in possession of LAPD.

"On Wednesday Morning, June 5, James Wiggins, editor
of the San Gabriel Section said that our city desk
requested that I go to an address on Howard Street in
Pasadena. This was alleged to be the suspect's home.

I came from our Temple City office, which is east of
Pasadena and consequently was driving on Howard St.
eastbound when I observed Richard Drew and Robert Leedom
in front of a white house which was not the address I had
been given. I also observed an unmarked police car and
surmised that this is the correct address. I got out _
my car and talked with Drew and Leedom~-there were two
LAPD officers (detectives in plain clothes. I know this
because I asked if they were LAPD or FBI and they answered
they were lapd.

"No onw was in the house because I could hear the phone
ringing and no one answering it.--The cops didn't try to
stop either Drew or myself from wandering around. I walked
into the back yard and saw a box of trash. I started going
through it to see if there was anything I could find that
would give us a hint of who the suspect was and where
he was from. I lifted a couple of pieces of newspaper
and discovered a spent .22-caliber slug. I told Dick
Drew to 'quick, go get the cops.' He did and detective
Edward Willis came back.--I showed him the slug--he looked
at it, but did not attempt to pick it up. --a few minutes
later he asked for my name--I gave it to him, then I gave
him one of my business cards--He asked for my home phone
and address which he subsequently, and in my presence,
wrote on the back of my card, which he kept. I assume this
is how Los Angeles Police came to have my business card
in their possession."
