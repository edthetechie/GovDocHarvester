PETER SPENCER BERKSON, age 194, residence, 5200
Mecca Road, telephone Number DI 3-5753, was interviewed at his
residence. BERKSON advised he is a student at Pierce Junior
College, Woodland Hills, California, and is employed as a box boy,
part time, at the Food Fair Market, Tarzana, California. He
further added that he is a professional free-lance photographer,
as are his father, ALBERT BERKSON, of the same address, and his
brother, DENNIS BERKSON, who resides at 5422 Quakertown,
Apartment 211, Woodland Hills, California, telephone Number
884-0669. BERKSON advised that he went to the Ambassador Hotel
in Los Angeles, California, at approximately 10:00 p.m., on
June 4, 1968, to photograph Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's victory
celebration. He advised he carried a 35 millimeter still camera
with a "strobe light" flash attachment and was shooting color film.

BERKSON advised he took some general photographs of
the Embassy Room at the hotel prior to Senator KENNEDY's arrival
in the room and also took photographs of KENNEDY during his
victory speech.

BERKSON advised that he followed KENNEDY and his
group as they left the stage and was approximately twenty feet
from him as they approached the doors to a kitchen located off
the Embassy Room.

BERKSON advised that he could not recall exactly the
next few minutes of activity; however, he recalled that as
KENNEDY was about to enter the kitchen, he observed a female
Caucasian run hurriedly away from the hallway or possibly out
of the kitchen and heard her yell, "fire". He advised that the
woman appeared to be in her late twenties or early thirties,
was huskily built, had reddish brown hair, and was wearing a
navy blue dress. He advised the woman appeared panicky as she
ran from the area of the kitchen door. He could not recall her
to be wearing any hat or glasses or any political campaign
paraphernalia. BERKSON advised he did not further observe this
woman; however, he believed that she was possibly photographed
by the television and movie cameras which were following Senator
KENNEDY's movements as he left the Embassy Room.

BERKSON advised that about this time, he heard what
sounded like two gunshots from the area outside the kitchen
door. He could not recall if there were additional gunshots
as there was loud screaming and yelling from the approximately
25 - 50 people located in the area from which the shots were
fired. ERKSON stated that after hearing the shots, he
immediately held the camera over his head and took several
photographs of the area from which the shots came. He stated that
he did not observe the individual who fired the shots nor did
he observe the alleged assassin, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, or his
apprehension following the attack; however, he indicated he may
have possibly photographed him in the series of photographs he
took. BERKSON stated that he did not observe Senator KENNEDY
at the time he was shot; however, he did observe and photograph
him while he was lying on the floor. He advised that he observed
Senator KENNEDY moving his mouth but could not discern what
Senator KENNEDY was saying.

: He advised that he observed another man who was
apparently a victim of the same attack which felled Senator
KENNEDY. He observed this man lying on the floor near the
kitchen and observed that this man was bleeding profusely from
the back of his head.

BERKSON advised that he remained at the hotel until
approximately 1:30 a.m. on June 5, 1968. He advised that after
shooting all of his film, he assisted his brother, DENNIS, who
was, in turn, working as an assistant to one of the NBC newsreel
photographers covering the event.

BERKSON advised that he returned home and his father
called the Time-Life Magazine in New York City, New York, regarding
the film taken by him, PETER BERKSON.

BERKSON advised that his father then delivered the

film to the Life Magazine office in Beverly Hills, California,
where the film was developed. BERKSON advised he was paid $750

by Life Magazine for the flim and that the film was subsequently
forwarded to Time-Life Magazine, New York City, New York. He
advised the film was sent to RICHARD POLLARD, Life Photo Editor,
Time and Life Building, New York, and that this individual would
have copies or knowledge of the film.

BERKSON advised that his father left the Ambassador
Hotel prior to the assassination of Senator KENNEDY; however,
his brother, DENNIS, was present at the hotel at the time and
could possibly furnish information concerning events relating
to the assassination.

BERKSON advised that the film he shot in connection
with Senator KENNEDY's assassination was now the property of
Time-Life Magazine and that he presently had no photographs,
prints, or negatives of the film he shot.

RALPH ELMORE, 4238 Mary Ellen Street, Apartment 3,
North Hollywood, California, furnished the following information:

He is employed as a télevision engineer for the
American Broadcasting Company and was on duty on the evening
of June 4, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles,
covering the election program involving ROBERT KENNEDY. He
was situated most of the evening in the vicinity of the podium
in what he believed to be the Embassy Room, and KENNEDY talked
to the crowd shortly before midnight that evening.

Following KENNEDY's talk, he followed the KENNEDY
party to the rear of the podium. The group turned right into
a kitchen area located at the right rear of the podium, and
he followed the group, carrying a microphone in one hand and
wearing an ear piece in his ear. He was aware that the
eventual destination of the party was the downstairs Ambassador
Room but was not aware of the intended route the group planned
to take to get to this room. He was of the impression that
ROBERT KENNEDY was directly in front of him but found out later
that it was actually PAUL SCHRADE, When the group entered the
c<itchen, he estimated that there were approximately twenty
people in the kitchen, which included the KENNEDY party and
several hotel employees. He then heard four sounds in rapid
succession that sounded like Chinese firecrackers exploding.
The next thing he knew, a man was lying on the floor directly
peneath him on his back and the man's face was covered with
plood. He thought at the instant this man was ROBERT KENNEDY
and immediately linked elbows with several individuals in th
immediate vicinity in an attempt to hold back the crowds that
had been attracted by the noise to the kitchen area and were
attempting to enter the kitchen. A fellow worker, an electrician,
was successful in getting GOLDSTEIN and WILLIAM WEISEL out of
the way so that they would not be trampled by the crowds.
GOLDSTEIN had been struck in the leg, and WEISEL in the abdomen

by bullets.

He then became aware that the crowd was giving most
of their attention to a man lying on the floor in front of the
ice machine and then realized that this person must be ROBERT
KENNEDY. He had the impression that about 25 or 30 feet in
front of him there was a hand resting on a serving table holding
a small barreled gun pointed directly at him and that it was
"spitting flame". He lost sight of the hand and the gun and
does not recall actually seeing the individual holding the gun.

He and several others had continued to attempt to
hold back the crowd from the kitchen area by linking elbows,
and he remembers one of these individuals as being a large Negro.
He also recalls that about this time some man came charging
toward him swinging his arms, and shortly thereafter several
of KENNEDY's assistants arrived on the scene to render assistance
to Me. KENNEDY. He then realized that the man on the floor at
his feet was PAUL SCHRADE, and he was subsequently successful
in transporting SCHRADE and WEISEL down the freight elevator
to an ambulance.

He does not know and has no recollection of seeing

SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN at the Ambassador Hotel. He saw
SIRHAN's photograph in the newspaper later in the day.

JODIE SAMS, Steward's Assistant, Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California, with residence at 187 East 36th Place,
Apartment 6, Los Angeles, California, advised that he was work-
ing at the conveyor at the coffee shop in the basement of the
hotel on Monday night, June 3, 1963. Sometime between 9:00 p.m.
and 10:00 p.m. on that date an individual walking in the cor-
ridor adjacent to the conveyor asked SAMS how he could get out of
the building. SAMS told this individual if he was a guest in
the hotel he could proceed on down to the main lobby and then
out of the building. However, if he was an employee or a trades-
man he should turn around and continue through the corridor to
the rear parking lot. The individual mumbled something to the
effect, "I'll go this way" and proceeded in the direction of
the main lobby of the hotel.

SAMS stated the individual did not appear to be a
guest as he was dressed shabbily and had dirty gray trousers.
SAMS particularly noted that the seat of the trousers were un-
usually dirty. SAMS stated he took this individual to be a
Mexican because he was swarthy and had what at the time SAMS
thought was a Mexican accent but definitely an accent of some
type.

SAMS stated that on Wednesday evening, June 5, 1968,
after the shooting of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY he saw a picture
of the alleged assailant in one of the Los Angeles newspapers
and recognized this individual as looking very much like the
individual who had questioned him as to directions in the base-
ment of the hotel on Monday night, June 3, 1968.

SAMS described the individual to whom he had given
directions on Monday night, June 3, 1968 as follows:

Miss ROBIN KAREN CASDEN, age 16, 17012 Mooncrest
Drive, Encino, California, telephone numbers 789-7736
and 784-4325, was advised of the identity of the interviewing
agent as an agent of the FBI. At this time, in the presence
of her mother, Mrs. BEATRICE CASDEN, Miss CASDEN furnished
the following information relative to the shooting of
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY:

She is a fan of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY and,
accompanied by three of her friends, went to the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, in order to hear
Senator KENNEDY's speech. She was accompanied to the
Ambassador Hotel by her girl friend, CORKY MC MAHON, who
resides at 4334 Oaklane Drive, Encino, California, CORKY's
boy friend, SCOTT HOWARD, telephone number 349-2401, and
LAURIE PORTER, telephone number 789-3230. CORKY does not
have a telephone connected at the present time.

Miss CASDEN recalled that she and her friends
arrived at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 8:30 p.m.,
and went to the ballroom. They arrived at the doors of
the ballroom at approximately 8:35 p.m., but did not go in.
They were unable to get into the ballroom inasmuch as there
were people at the door checking for press cards. She and
the others in her group, at this point, saw LAURIE's mother
and father, Mr. and Mrs. JERRY PORTER. JERRY PORTER was
recently elected a California State Senator. Mr. and Mrs.
JERRY PORTER were also outside the ballroom attempting to
get in. Inasmuch as they were unable to get into the
ballroom, she, CORKY and LAURIE went to the kitchen area
and slipped in-and went straight through the kitchen.
SCOTT also accompanied them. No one checked them in the
kitchen or at the kitchen door leading to the ballroom.

She did not recall seeing any guards in the kitchen or atthe
kitchen door, She actually entered the ballroom about 8:45
to 8:50 p.m. There were several hundred people milling
around in the room. She noticed a small group of singers
and musicians on the platform. This group also moved around
theballroom entertaining the people, -Wheh

Miss CASDEN and her friends actually got into the ballroom,
they met IRA GOLDSTEIN and had a short conversation with
him. IRA then walked on mingling with other people.

CORKY and SCOTT decided to stay in one place and wait

for the speech af ROBERT KENNEDY.

LAURIE and ROBIN just walked around and talked
to various people. Later, LAURIE and ROBIN separated.
Miss CASDEN noticed that although people were checking
the other doors to the ballroom, she did not see anyone
guarding or checking people entering from the kitchen door
and many people came through the kitchen into the ballroom.

She recalled that Senator KENNEDY came into the
ballroom about 11:45 p.m. CORKY and SCOTT were still sitting
in chairs close to the news telephones.. Miss CASDEN kept
going back and forth to talk with CORKY and SCOTT. She
met IRA GOLDSTEIN again and began wandering around with
him observing the activities. Miss CASDEN did not see
Senator KENNEDY come into the ballroom. She saw him first
on the speakers' platform. During Senator KENNEDY's speech
she and IRA went back to the kitchen to get a sandwich,
as some man who passed ker mentioned that there were sandwiches
in the kitchen. They decided to make a quick trip to the
kitchen to get a sandwich and come back and listen to the
rest of Senator KENNEDY's speech. Miss CASDEN and IRA went
to the kitchen; they observed no sandwiches. She recalled
that there were several people in the kitchen in addition
to hotel employees. She recalled seeing two waiters and
another employee cleaning tables. She recalled seeing a
person in the rear of the kitchen area who may possibly
have been the suspect, SIRHAN SIRHAN. At that time, she
was just vaguely aware of this individual in the rear of

433

the kitchen. She recalled this person as having dark hair
and appearing to be of Mexican extraction. She recalled
that he was not wearing a suit; however, she could not
remember the type of clothing this person actually was
wearing. She stated that she had seen a photograph

of the suspect, SIRHAN SIRHAN, but was unable to state
definitely that the person in the rear of the kitchen

was or was not identical to SIRHAN SIRHAN,

She also noted there were several men in suits
in the kitchen area and one or two women, She was unable
to recall any specific details or descriptive data on these
individuals. Her impression is that this all occurred
in two or three minutes. Then Senator KENNEDY came into
the kitchen from the ballroom with his party. She and
IRA GOLDSTEIN stepped back out of his path. Senator
KENNEDY was shaking hands with people. He shook hands with
a waiter near Miss CASDEN and then approached her. He
smiled and shook her hand and passed on, taking about three
steps. -At this point, Miss CASDEN heard two separate
consecutive noises, resembling a cap gun shot. Bomeone
fell against Miss CASDEN at this point and then she heard
the rest of the shots. The shots came in a jerky, but
rapid manner. She realized that they were shots after
the person fell against her. She recalled that there was
a lull between the first two shots and the remainder of
the shots. During this lull, the individual who fell against
her continued to the floor. The lull appeared to her as
only four or five seconds. The shots commenced again
and she heard a woman scream. Miss CASDEN moved to the
side toward the wall to avoid the shots and then continued
her movement to leave the kitchen area. Later, after
reflection of the circumstances, she thought perhaps
the person who fell against her after the first two shots
and then fell on the floor may have been Senator KENNEDY.
At any rate, it was positively the person who was struck
by the first two bullets.

Miss CASDEN stated that she did not observe the
person who actually did the shooting. ~ She
made her way out of the kitchen into the ballroom in a
matter of a few seconds. She was hysterical, but recognized
her friends, CORKY and SCOTT, who tried to calm her.
SCOTT left to see what happened and CORKY stayed with Miss
CASDEN and attempted to calm her and wipe some blood off
her face. A plain-clothes man with a badge in his wallet
came up and displayed the badge to Miss CASDEN and CORKY.
This man seeing CORKY wiping the blood from Miss CASDEN's
face asked if she had been shot. She told him no. He
asked if she wanted a doctor and CORKY said yes inasmuch
as Miss CASDEN was still hysterical, The man immediately
went and obtained something for Miss CASDEN to drink.
She does not recall what it was. At this point, SCOTT
came back and Miss CASDEN had calmed down by this time.
The man with the badge had asked them to move out of the
area, so they left. On the way out they saw LAURIE and
another girl with her. LAURIE and this girl also left
together.

Miss CASDEN stated that at the time of the shooting
she was wearing a white sheer dress, with a white on white
flower design. She recalled that the dress had several
blood spots on it. She stated that she still has the dress
but that it was washed and the spots removed.

Miss CASDEN described herself as 5'3", 120 pounds,
hazel eyes, long brown hair, born She was Pll
observed to be Caucasian. Miss CASDEN stated that on the
night of the KENNEDY shooting she was wearing her hair
long in the back with a ponytail on top, with a white bow

at approximately 12:15 a.m., on the morning of June 5, 1968.

had possibly seen the suspect prior to the shooting and

Mrs. CAROL ANN BRESHEARS, 5709 Ewing Canyon, La
Canada, California, was interviewed at Kennedy For President
Campaign Headquarters, 5615 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California, and she furnished the following information.

She has been a volunteer campaign worker for the
KENNEDY Group for the past four months, and was in attendance
at the election returns party at the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles on June 4, 1968. One of her paramount duties as
a campaign worker involved taking charge of the KENNEDY Girls.

On the evening of June 4, 1968, she was in the
Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel and had a number of the
KENNEDY Girls stationed near the stape. Near midnight,
awaiting the arrival of Senator KENNEDY, on the right side
of the stage as one faces the stage, she noticed a girl on an
elevated section which had been prepared for a television
camera. This girl was seemingly out of place since she was
wearing a white dress with MC CARTHY written over the dress in
blue letters, She also noticed that the girl was not wearing
a yellow press badge which was required of most of the individuals
present in the Embassy Room. This girl was in her early 20s,
between 125 to 130 pounds, and had shoulder length, dark hair.

Following his speech, which ended shortly after
midnight, Senator KENNEDY exited from the stage through a
curtained entrance in the rear of the stage and proceeded
with his party toward the double doors leading to the kitchen
area on the right rear section of the stage. She estimated
that there were about ten persons in Senator KENNEDY's party
which included his bodyguards, newspaper men, and ROOSEVELT
GRIER, ‘

She was standing between the stage and the entrance to the
double doors leading to the kitchen, about six or eight feet
from these double doors. She spoke briefly to Senator KENNEDY
as he passed with his party and shortly after that, after he
had passed through the double doors, she heard shots. The
first two sounded like popping balloons, but the next eight

shots sounded like gun shots and they all sounded similar.

She ran forward toward the kitchen area and believed that she

saw Senator KENNEDY falling to the floor. There were about 20
people in the kitchen at the time and she did not see anyone
holding a gun or shooting a gun. She did notice three or four
people who appeared to be scuffling in the kitchen area. She did
not see SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and does not know anything about
this individual.

There wasa lot of shooting and yelling going on
in the room and one woman came out of the kitchen area with
blood on her head. She heard someone calling for a doctor
and immediately proceeded to the press area on the other side
of the stage in an attempt to find a telephone to call for a
doctor. Several doctors were subsequently located in
attendance and went back to the kitchen area to treat the
injured, Later, she returned to the press area and obtained
some ice to be used in treating the injured. Because of the
crowd, she was unable to get into the kitchen area but managed
to pass the ice through the crowd into the kitchen area. She
did recall seeing Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor with
alot of blood around his head, Another boy who had apparently
been injured was seated in a chair in the kitchen area and was
being treated.

Sne has no knowledge of why anyone would want to

shoot ROBERT F, KENNEDY except that apparently someone did not
wish to see him become President of the United States.

On June 5, 1968, Mr. ENRIQUE RABAGO, 6652 Naomi

CORDERO, 912 South Maple Avenue, Los Angeles, California,
voluntarily appeared at the Los Angeles Office of the FBI
to furnish information they believed pertinent to the assault
of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY at the Ambassador Hotel on
June 5, 1968.

Mr. RABAGO and Mr. CORDERO requested that they
be interviewed together and this interview was conducted by

PAUL CHAMBERLAIN, JR., who identified himself to them as a

Special Agent of the FBI.

Mr. ENRIQUE RABAGO advised that on the Fourth of
June 1968, he traveled to the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles, accompanied by his friend, HUMPHREY
CORDERO, to observe activities at the KENNEDY Election Head-
quarters. RABAGO stated that he and CORDERO arrived at the
Ambassador Hotel in his, RABAGO's, panel truck at some time
between the hours of 9 and 9:30 PM. Mr. RABAGO advised that
he parked his panel truck several blocks from the Ambassador
Hotei in that no closer parking spaces were available and he
and CORDERO then proceeded to the front door of the Ambassador
Hotel.

RABAGO advised that he and CORDERO were both dressed
in casual clothing and because of this he hesitated to enter
the main Lobby of the hotel. He stated, however, that he
and CORDERO did enter at CORDERO's urging, but became separated
due to the large crowd approximately ten minutes after their arriva’

hotel where he hoped to locate him. RABAGO advised that upon
arriving at the front porch, he noticed a great many people
standing and talking about the election and RABAGO disclosed
that he entered into a general conversation with a number of
people standing there. Mr. RABAGO advised that it was at this time

that he first observed an individual whom he later recognized
to be identical with the individual whose picture appeared

on the front page of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner on

June 5, 1968. RABAGO advised that the local newspapers
identified the individual in question as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.
RABAGO advised that this individual was standing on the porch
alone sipping from a drink and he stated that at this time

he engaged this man in conversation concerning the election.
RABAGO advised that he said to the individual, whom he later
learned to be named SIRHAN, "Are we going to win?", and to
this SIRHAN replied, "I think we're going to win." RABAGO
said that he replied to STRHAN, "I don't know,MC CARTHY is
ahead now", to which SIRHAN replied, "Don't worry about him

if he doesn't win, the son of a bitch, he is a millionaire and
he doesn't need to win. He just wants to go to the White
House but even if he wins he's not going to do anything for
you or for me or for any of the poor people.' RABAGO advised
that this man continued talking to him and told him that
"KENNEDY did not care about any poor people and merely sought
to gain the Presidency for personal reasons." RABAGO advised
also that this individual was apparently becoming very disgusted
with Mr. KENNEDY and told him that "KENNEDY was going to buy
the Presidency."

RABAGO stated at this point in the conversation, he
was about to leave in disgust when his friend HUMPHREY CORDERO
located him on the front porch. RABAGO stated CORDERO asked
him where he had been and after explaining, CORDERO said to
him, “Let's go back into the lobby". RABAGO stated that he
replied to CORDERO in the negative in that his clothes were
not adequate to which CORDERO replied, by turning to the
individual, whom he later learned to be identical to SIRHAN
and saying, “Look at my friend, he doesn't want to go in
because of his clothing. What do you think of that?" RABAGO

advised that to this comment the individual in question,
replied, "We're voters. I can go in there like this. I

just returned from the RAFFERTY Headquarters." RABAGO stated
that SIRHAN then proceeded to relate an incident to HUMPHREY
CORDERO that had occurred to him inside the RAFFERTY Campaign
room. RABAGO disclosed that SIRHAN told CORDERO that he had
gone in to order a drink and that the people in there had
stared at him and obviously disliked him because of his
clothing. RABAGO advised that he continued by telling CORDERO
that the “big wheels" stared at him while he ordered a drink
from the hostess and that he "showed them" by paying for his
drink with a $20 bill and leaving the change for the hostess.
RABAGO stated further that SIRHAN told HUMPHREY that "Its

the money you have got that counts, not the way you look".

RABAGO stated that at this point in the conversation,
he walked towards the television monitor and that this was the
last time in the evening that he saw this individual whom
he later learned to be identical with SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

RABAGO advised again that the individual in question
was positively alone when he observed him and at no time did
he ever see this man speaking with anyone but himself or
HUMPHREY CORDERO.

RABAGO stated that from his conversation with this
man he definitely obtained the impression that he, SIRHAN,
did not like Mr. KENNEDY personally due to the fact that
he was a millionaire.

RABAGO stated that he hag never seen the individual,
identified as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, before and that the length
of his conversation with him was approximately five minutes
long.

"I did not feel like going in to the building in
that I was not dressed in a suit, but was wearing
casual clothing, however, my friend, HUMPHREY CORDERO,
urged me to go in with him. We entered the main lobby
of the hotel and after approximately ten minutes I
became separated from CORDERO due to the large number
of people standing around. :

"IT could not see HUMPHREY CORDERO and I. there-
fore walked to the porch area at the front of the main
entrance on Seventh Street hoping that he would find me
there. Upon arriving on the front porch, I noticed
a great many people standing there talking. I started
talking to several of these people in a general con-
versation concerning the election returns and it was.
at this time that I first observed an individual whom
I later learned.to be identical with SITRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN from pictures in the 'Los Angeles Herald Examin-
er' as well as local television programs. This in-
dividual was standing on the porch alone sipping from
a drink and I engaged him in conversation concerning
the election. I said to him 'Are we going to win?! and
he answered 'I think we are going to win.'! At this
time I said to him 'I don't know MC CARTHY is ahead
now' and he replied 'Don't worry about him if he
doesn't win, the son of a bitch, he's a millionaire
and he doesn't need to win. He justewants to go to
the White House, but even if he wins -he's not going
to do anything for you or for me or for any of the
poor people.' This man continued talking to me and
he told me that 'KENNEDY did not care about any poor
people and merely sought to gain the Presidency for
personal reasons!. I feel that this man was becoming
very disgusted with Mr. KENNEDY and at this time told
me that ‘KENNEDY was going to buy the Presidency’.

"At this point I became disgusted with this
individual's opinions and was about to walk away
when my friend, HUMPHREY CORDERO, arrived. HUMPHREY
CORDERO asked me where I had-> been and I told him
I had become lost in the crowd and had come to the
porch to wait for him. HUMPHREY said to me ‘Let's
go back into the lobby' and I told him that I did
not want to return because my clothes were not good
enough. At this point HUMPHREY turned to the man
I later recognized from the 'Los Angeles Herald
Examiner' to be the man accused of assaulting ROBERT
KENNEDY and beckoned to me saying 'Look at my friend,
he doesn't want to go in because of his clothing.
What do you think of that?! To this comment the
man in question replied 'We're voters. We can go in
there like this. I just returned from the RAFFERTY
headquarters.! At this time he told HUMPHREY CORDERO
about an incident that occurred to him inside the
RAFFERTY campaign room. He told HUMPHREY that he
had gone in to order a drink and that the people
in there stared at him and obviously did not like
him because of his clothing. He also told HUMPHREY
that these 'big wheels' watched him as he ordered
a drink from the hostess and he continued by telling
CORDERO that he 'showed them'by paying for his drink
with a $20.00 bill and leaving the change for the
hostess. He told HUMPHREY, at this point, that
‘it is the money you have got that counts, not the
way you look.' I cannot positively quote the above
conversation between CORDERO and this man because at
the same time I was watching a television monitor
concerning the election results.

"At this point I walked into the main lobby to

be closer to the television set and this was the last
time I saw the man in question. This individual was

"positively alone when I saw him and at no time did
I see him talking with anyone but HUMPHREY CORDERO
or myself. I definitely got the impression from
talking with this man that he did not like Mr.
KENNEDY personally because of the fact that he was
a millionaire.

"The entire length of my conversation with this
man was approximately five minutes.

"HUMPHREY CORDERO and I stayed at the campaign
headquarters until approximately 10:15 or 10:30 p.m.
at which time we left going in my panel truck to
our homes.

"Later that evening I first heard of the shooting
of ROBERT KENNEDY on the radio, but it was not until
the next day that I first saw a television picture
of the man who is accused of shooting Mr. KENNEDY.

I recognized this man to be the same as the man I had
spoken to at the Ambassador Hotel on the previous
evening. Later this same day, June 5, 1968, I

again saw this man's picture on the front page of

the 'Los Angeles Herald Fxaminer' identified as the
individual accused of assaulting ROBERT KENNEDY.

I first saw this paper when HUMPHREY CORDERO purchased
it and brought it to my truck. Immediately after
seeing this picture and discussing the situation,
HUMPHREY CORDERO and I drove to the Los Angeles Office
of the FBI, arriving at approximately 5:00 - 5:30 p.m.
where we were interviewed by Special Agent PAUL
CHAMBERLAIN, JR.

"Special Agent CHAMBERLAIN has shown me photo-
graphs of six male Caucasians and from these pictures
I picked the photogtaph of an individual whom I am cer-
tain was the individual that I had talked to on the
night of June 4, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel.

Senator ROBERT KENNEDY. He and the WORTHEYs arrived at the
hotel at about 8:30 P.M. and went to the Embassy Room.

They found that they could not gain admittance to this room
because it was apparently reserved for the press. He and
the WORTHEYs then went to the first floor of the hotel and
to a room which had been reserved for the use of the KENNEDY
campaign workers' victory celebration,

: At about 9:30 P.M., while still in this room,

he went to one of the two bars in the room, which he described
as the larger bar. He noticed an individual standing against
a wall adjacent to the bar. This person appeared to be

out of place inasmuch as he did not seem to be joining in the
apparent festivity nor was he wearing any campaign buttons

or any tother items indicating his affiliation with the
KENNEDY campaign.

Since having seen newspaper photographs of the
alleged assassin of Senator KENNEDY, he believes this
individual to be identical with SIRHAN SIRHAN. He carried
oneno conversation with this individual and never saw him again
during that evening. This individual was wearing a sport shirt
and slacks, light in color. He observed no individuals
standing near this person. As WORTHEY's wife was pregnant
and not feeling well, MASHAYEKHI and the WORTHEYs left
the hotel Sout 11:30 P M. and returned to Pasadena.

MASHAYEKHI furnished the following descriptive
information regarding himself:

Miss SANDRA SERRANC, 2212 North Marengs. Street;
Altadena, (794-6514), advised she was co-chairman of the Youth
for KENNEDY Committee for the Pasadena-Altadena area. SERRANO
advised she is 20 years old and employed by United Insurance
Company of America, 727 West 7th Street, Los Angeles, (627-9134)
as a key punch operator. Miss SERRAN@ advised she lives with
her aunt and uncle, HERMAN and CECELIA MAGDALENO, at the
above address. Her parents are MANUEL and AMPARO SERRANO),
1949 West 27th Street, Lorain, Ohio (216-282-9048).

Miss SERRANO advised that at. approximately 8:30 p.m.,
June 4, 1968, she left the Youth for KENNEDY Pasadena
Headquarters with four other committee workers to go to the
Ambassador to await the primary results. This group went in a
car belonging to GREG ABBOTT, 1009 Arcadia Street, Arcadia.
MICHAEL FRANCHEK, 3556 Milton Street, Pasadena, (795-2865),
GEORGE FREDERICKS, JR., 281 Crescent Drive, (681-2180) , and
TRENE CHAVEZ, a friend who rooms with Miss SERRAN®'s aunt and
uncle at the North . Marengo address, were includeu in the group.

Miss SERRANO advised that while at the Ambassador
waiting for the primary returns, she had someone buy her a
Grink, a screwdriver. According to SERRANO, at approximately
11:30 p.m., she walked out of the ballroom area to an outdoor
terrace stairway because it had become too warm and crowded
in the ballroom. She sat on the fifth or six step of the
stairway which lead to an upstairs area. Miss SERRAN® could
not describe what this upper area was. Two or three minutes
later, which SERRANO estimated to be approximately 11:35 p.m.,
three individuals approached her on the stairway, a woman and
two men, and walked past her up the stairs. As the woman got
to her, this woman said, “Excuse us" and Miss SERRAN@ moved to
the side so they could pass. SERRANO said she felt these three
people were together since they were walking together up the
stairs and the woman had said, "Excuse us."

After approximately 20 to 25 minutes, which Miss
SERRANO believed was shortly after midnight, she heard what
- she thought was six back fires from a car. Four qr five were

real close together. During this 20 or 25 minutes, no other
person went up or down this stairway past her. Approximately
30 seconds after hearing what she thought was back fire, this
same woman who had gone up the stairs came running down the
stairs toward her, followed by one of the men who had gone

up the stairs with her. Miss SERRANO stated that as this woman
ran down the stairs toward her, the woman shouted, "We shot

him - we shot him." Miss SERRANO said, "Who did you shoot?"

to which this woman replied, "Senator KENNEDY." Miss SERRANO
was asked if this woman could have said, "He shot him" or "They
shot him" rather than "We shot him." SERRANO insisted the

word was "We" but volunteered that she realized that "we" .
could have meant we, meaning we as a group of KENNEDY supporters
or as we as society in general.

Miss SERRANO did not notice in which direction these
people went after they passed her on the stairs since she
looked up the stairs behind her and immediately left and walked
back just inside the hallway area. She met a gray uniformed
security officer just inside the door and said to him, "Is it
true they shot him?" This uniformed officer replied, "Shot
who?" and she replied, "Senator KENNEDY." Miss SERRANO said at
this point the uniformed officer told her she must have had too
much to drink. SERRANO commented she still held her drink
giass. A few minutes later a group of five or six people came
towards her from the ballrocm area and SERRANO said to them,
"They have shot him." These people did not answer her but she
heard one comment from the group, "Oh she's crazy" and another
comment, "Oh my God."

At this point, Miss SERRANO advised she looked for a
public phone so she could call her parents in Ohio. She said
at about 12:15 p.m., she found a public phone. Miss SERRANO
_ said she knows she had $3.00 in change and thinks she tried to
pay for the toll charge but had trouble with the phone and believes
she ended up reversing the charges to her parents' phone. While
SERRANO was talking to her mother trying to explain to her that
Senator KENNEDY had been shot, people started to pound on the
door of the phone booth trying to get in. One of these people

- 465 -

LA 56-156

was (first name unknown) FRANKSTEIN, a KENNEDY co-worker,
and she asked him if it was true that Senator KENNEDY was
shot. He replied, "Yes." SERRANO then tried to explain

to her mother that it was true but felt she did not really
get it across to her mother and hung up the phone. Miss
SERRANO stated she was crying and near complete hysteria and
did not know what to do.

SERRANO was asked to explain why she would call
her parents long distance in Ohio before she had confirmed
the fact that Senator KENNEDY had been shot. She said, "If
you could have seen the expression in the face and heard the
way she said, 'We shot him,' you would have believed her too."

After leaving the telephone, SERRANO walked back
towards the ballroom area and recalls meeting GREG ABBOTT.
She tried to tell ABBOTT what she had seen but could not get
him to understand. She then met DAVE HAINES, another co-worker
for the Youth for KENNEDY Campaign, and could not get him to
understand since he had a girl with him who was crying and
completely hysterical. SERRANO then sat in front of a
television set and said aloud, "I saw these people come down
the stairs, what am I going to do?” A person in the area told
her she should find a police officer to tell her story to.
SERRANO walked out of the ballroom area and met her friend,
IRENE CHAVEZ. She tried to explain her story to IRENE but could
not get her to completely understand. They walked out of the
hotel area towards the parking lot but found they could not
leave the parking area and started to return to the hotel. As
they returned to the hotel, SERRANO walked up to a man and said,
"I saw them run down the stairs, what can I do?" This man
identified himself as Mr. AMBROSE, a District Attorney from
Beverly Hills, (836-5685), and told her to come with him and
he would find a police officer to tell her story to. SERRANO
said they found two uniformed police officers and these officers
took her to an area inside the hotel where they were keeping
witnesses. While she was sitting in this area, a person asked
her if she was a witness. She briefly told this person what she
had seen and before she realized it, she was being interviewed
on television at which time she gave her story the best she could.

Miss SERRANO said after this. television interview,
. she was taken to the Rampart Substation of the Los Angeles
- Police Department and interviewed and then taken to the Homicide
Division of the Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters and
reinterviewed.

Miss SERRANO described the woman she saw on the stair-
way as being a white female, 23 to 27 years of age, 5'6” tall,
medium build, 125 pounds. She had dark brown hair, ear length
(bouffant style) and wore a white voile cloth dress with black
quarter inch polkadots. The dots were about 13 to 2" apart.

This dress had three quarter length sleeves, a bib collar with

a small black bow and was A-lined style. (SERRANO said she took
special note of the dress since she had a friend with one just
like it). This woman wore black shoes and no purse. SERRANO
said this woman did not wear glasses and had a "funny nose"
which she described as a "BOB HOPE” type. SERRANO said she
felt she could identify this individual again.

SERRANO described the male individual whom she saw

go both up and down the stairs with this woman as being a white
male (Latin extraction), 5'5" tall, 21 to 23 years, olive
complexion, black hair, long - straight, hanging over his
forehead and needed a haircut. He wore dark pants, light shirt,
and a gold or yellow cardigan type sweater and had nothing in his
hands. SERRANO said she was not sure if she could identify this
‘person again.

Miss SERRANO described the other male individual who
she. saw only go up the stairs with this woman as being a white
male (Mexican-American), about 23 years of age, 5' 3" tall,
curly, bushy hair and wore light colored clothes. She said
after seeing the picture of SIRHAN SIRHAN in the newspaper,
she felt certain this was the same person she saw go up the
stairs with this woman.

Miss SERRANO was asked if she was certain of the events
as described above. She said she realizes she was near hysteria
over the shooting, but was sure of the events she described.
SERRANO said she had only the one drink and was not taking any
type of medication or pills.

On June 7, 1968, SERRANO was taken to the Ambassador
Hotel and asked to locate and reenact the incident described
by her above.

She had difficulty in locating the stairway she
described but once she found the stairway, she was able to
orientate and describe the events as she recalled them. This
stairway is located on the south side of the Ambassador Ballroom
and 1§. used for emergency fire stairs. Large double doors
open onto the stairway from a hallway adjacent to the Ambassador
Room. From this doorway, the stairs go down to ground level
and up to double fire doors leading into the Embassy Room
which is located directly above the Ambassador Room. It is
noted that Senator KENNEDY gave his speech in the Embassy Room
and the Ambassador Room below was used to accomodate the over-
flow crowd. Television sets had been set up throughout the
Ambassador Room in order to witness the events taking place
upstairs.

Miss SERRANO advised that she had gone to another
exit door before finding the exit to these stairs but could
not get out because a uniformed guard told her she was not
allowed to go out the doors. She said there was no guard at
the double doors she went out to this stairway and the doors
were closed. She noted that a uniformed guard whom she
described as a white male, approximately 27 years of age,
with dark hair, wearing a gray uniform, was inside the door
when she went back into the hallway area. This is the guard
she asked if ft-vwas true that Senator KENNEDY had been shots

SERRANO located a bank of public telephones located
in the hallway leading to the main entrance of the Ambassador
Room as being the bank of telephones she found to make the call
to her mother. She said that there are five public phones in
this bank and she identified telephones 386-082! or 386-9837
as the phone she used.

This same date, Miss SERRANO was taken to the
NBC Studios, Burbank, California, and all film coverage
taken by NBC at the KENNEDY primary celebration was reviewed
by Miss SERRANO. She was unable to locate anyone in this
film she thought might .¢ identical to the woman or the men
she hed seen on the stairway.

Senator KENNEDY was shot,

HUGHES stated that he was aware of the kitchen
location of the Embassy Ballroom where KENNEDY was shot, and
it was his opinion that it would have been impossible for
SERRANO to hear .22 shots on her location on a stairway
described by her. He said this was especially true because
of the crowded conditions of the Embassy Room, and he knew
that many people much closer than SERRANO who were inside
the building did not hear the shots.
