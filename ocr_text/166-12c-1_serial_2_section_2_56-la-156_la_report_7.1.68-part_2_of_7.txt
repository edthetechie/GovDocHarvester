Mr. EDWARD MINASIAN, residing at 129 North Lamer
Street, Burbank, California, and employed in the catering
department of the Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California, was reinterviewed at which time he
advised as follows:

In connection with the change of plans wherein Senator
ROBERT KENNEDY was proceeding to the Colonial Room of the
Ambassador Hotel instead of going to the Embassy Ballroom as
originally planned, MINASIAN explained as follows:

On the night of June 4, 1968, after Senator KENNEDY
completed his victory speech in the Embassy Room, he and his
party, which included PIERRE SALINGER, JESSE UNRUH, FRANK
MANKIEWICZ, and several others whom he could not remember, left
the stage and entered a rampway leading to the hallway to the
Ambassador Ballroom. He recalled he was walking in front of
Senator KENNEDY and while the KENNEDY party was following him,
they were discussing the advisability of going to the Colonial
Room for a brief press conference before going downstairs to
the Ambassador Ballroom. He said this discussion was very brief,
lasting no more than 15 to 20 seconds.

He said he stopped at the end of the passageway before
entering the aisle leading to the Ambassador Ballroom. ‘The
KENNEDY party turned right into the passageway leading to the
Colonial Room, and he joined the KENNEDY party, walking on
Senator KENNEDY's right side.

He said he feels certain the decision to go to the
Colonial Room instead of the Ambassador Ballroom was a spontaneous
decision after a brief conference. He based this upon the
conversation he overheard plus the fact that as of the time
KENNEDY was delivering his victory speech, the plans were for him
to proceed directly to the Ambassador Ballroom.

MINASIAN said inasmuch as he was walking in front of the
KENNEDY party, he did not see who took part in the discussion but
believes he recalls hearing the voices of Senator KENNEDY, FRANK
other whom he could not recall,

PATRICIA ELIZABETH NELSON, also known as Patti Nelson,
15311 Cornuta Avenue, Bellflower, California, furnished the
following additional information to that she had furnished to the
FBI on June 5, 1968 regarding her having observed a man carrying
a package from which protruded what she thought could have been
a gun stock,sunning from the EmbassyRoom of the Ambassador Hotel,
Log Angeles, California, at about 12:10 a.m. on June 5, 1968,
just before she learned that Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY had been
shot:

Her further thoughts on the matter, after viewing the
video tape on June 7, 1968, of a ABC news cast with FRANK REYNOLDS,
which had been aired June 5, 1958, in Los Angeles over ABC Channel
7 from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., ehe had reached certain conclusions.

She noted on the video tape, after identifying the man
pictured on this tape as the same man she had seen running from
the Ambassador Hotel, that the package that the man was carrying,
when observed on the video tape and which hs presented to Senator
ROBERT F. KENNEDY for autographing on the tape, was the same
package that this man was carrying when observed running from the
Hotel's Embassy Room. The package observed on the video tape
appeared to her to be a cardboard carton, about 3" in diameter
and 3! in length, which is commonly used to carry posters or maps.
She had further observed that this carton, as pictured on video
tape, appeared to be very light in weight when handled by Senator
ROBERT KENNEDY at the time of autographing. On the basis of what
she had observed on the video tape, she now had doubts as to whether
what she had originally observed about the package in question could
in fact have contained a stock of a gun protruding from it, ae she
had originally believed it may have had.

FRED PARROTT, M.D., was interviewed at his office,
1704 West Manchester Avenue, Suite 210, and furnished the
following information:

On June 4, 1968, he went to the Ambassador Hotel
at approximately 11:30 PM to listen to the victory speech
of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY. He found that the hotel was
so crowded that he could not get into the Embassy Room,
the room in which Senator KENNEDY was giving his speech.

Snortly after midnight, while standing near the
door to the Embassy Room, he heard a great deal of shouting
and screaming from the interior of the room. Shortly after,
Drs“MARCUS MC BROOM, a Psychologist whom he knew, came out
of the room and said that doctors were needed. Dr. PARROTT
attempted to enter the Embassy Room; however, a guard at the
door refused to allow him to enter. While he was trying to
identify himself, Dr. ROSS MILLER slipped past the guard
and went into the Embassy Room, apparently to see if he could
render any aid.

With the tremendous crowd that had gathered in the
Embassy Room, he never did reach the injured people and did
not see SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, However, while standing
outside the door to the Embassy Room, a man came by carrying
a rolled up newspaper under his arm. As the man pressed
through the crowd, passing right next to Dr. PARROTT, he
kept saying, “Excuse me, please". Dr, PARROTT noticed that
he appeared to have glassy eyes, as though he were ill.
Just after this man passed, several men, whom he assumed
were from the KENNEDY Party, came through the crowd hollering,
"Stop that man! Stop that mani", indicating the man who had
been carrying the newspaper. He does not know if these men
were successful in getting the man with the newspaper stopped,
but.the last time he observed them, they were going out the
south door of the Ambassador Hotel. He described the name
with the newspaper as a white male, dark complexion, dark
hair, 25 to 27 years old, 5'7" tall, medium build. He said

The only other thing that he observed which

men carrying a fifth man out of the hotel saying, "Let's
get out of here", He did not know if the man they were
carrying had been injured in the crowd.

A photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA STRHAN was
exhibited to Dr. PARROTT but he advised he did not recognize
him as anyone he has ever seen, PARROTT stated that he
went to the Ambassdor Hotel with his friend, SAMUEL STRAIN,

passage way. JUDY ROYER stated that she was then escorted behind
the easterly most warming counter in an effort to get out of
the way and when she was behind the warming counter she saw
ROOSEVELT GRIER holding on to a man.

JUDY ROYER wae shown Los Angeles Police Department
photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment booking number 495-139, and she positively identified the
individual in the photograph as the man she had seen ROOSEVELT
GRIER holding on to the night of June 4, 1968 in the passage way
behind the Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles,
California.

JUDY ROYER stated that the last thing she remembers
was that California Assembly Speaker JESSE UNRUH was on top of
one of the warming counters yelling repeatedly "Don't kill him,
don't kill him". JUDY ROYER stated that the officers of the
Los Angeles Police Department came and took the man ROOSEVELT
GRIER was holding into custody and they left the area. JUDY ROYER
stated that she then returned to the staff area and in the mean-
time Senator KENNEDY had been moved so that he could receive
medical treatment.

JUDY ROYER stated that when she saw ROOSEVELT GRIER
holding SIRHAN SIRHAN she recognized him as a man she had pre-
viously seen in the passage way behind the stage of the Embassy
Room and told him to leave that area. JUDY ROYER stated that
during the evening of June 4, 1968 she had been walking in the
passage way behind the stage of the Embassy Room from the anti-
room area to the Colonial Room trying to keep the passage way
clear. JUDY ROYER stated that the reason she was trying to keep
the passage way clear was because a Los Angeles Fire Marshal
had told them they had too many people in the staff area. JUDY
ROYER stated that she cannot remember the exact time she saw
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in the passage way behind the stage of
the Embassy Room but she believes it was approximately one or
two hours before Senator KENNEDY made his speech. JUDY ROYER
stated that when she saw SIRHAN SIRHAN he was in the passage way
immediately east of the anti-room behind the stage of the Embassy
Room. JUDY ROYER stated that she noticed SIRHAN STRHAN standing
near a doorway in the passage way. She did not recognize him
as a member of the staff or a member of the press and she told
him to leave. JUDY ROYER stated that she is familiar with most
of the members of the press due to her long relationship with
former California Governor EDMUND "PAT" BROWN and she also knew
most of the members of Senator KENNEDY's campaign staff. JUDY
ROYER stated that she told SIRHAN SIRHAN to leave’ the passage
way behind the stage of the Embassy Room and she watched him
walk into the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel. JUDY ROYER
stated she did not notice anything unusual about his behavior and
she stated she did not notice if he had anything in his hands or
if he carried anything. JUDY ROYER further stated that she did
not see anyone with him and he appeared to be alone. JUDY ROYER
stated that she told him she was sorry but that he could not re-
main in that area because it was reserved for members of Senator
KENNEDY's campaign staff and members of the press only. JUDY ROYER
stated that after she told SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN this and asked
him if he would mind leaving he turned and entered the Embassy
Room. JUDY ROYER stated that SIRHAN SIRHAN was wearing a light
blue jacket or sweatshirt type jacket and light blue trousers.

JUDY ROYER stated that she is positive SIRHAN SIRHAN is the same
man she saw ROOSEVELT GRIER holding in the passage way and that
in addition SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN is the same individual she had
seen approximately one or two hours before Senator KENNEDY made
his speech, standing in the passage way behind the Embassy Room.

JUDY ROYER stated that the reason she is so positive
is because her first thought when she saw ROOSEVELT GRIER hold-
ing SIRHAN SIRHAN was that she had seen this man in the passage
way behind the stage of the Embassy Room previously and had asked
him to leave.

Mrs. OLGA SEKULIC, 3462 Broadway, Huntington Park,
California, furnished the following information:

She advised she is an American citizen but has spent
a number of years living in Toronto, Canada. She campaigned
for JOHN F, KENNEDY in Boston, Massachusetts when JOHN F, KENNEDY
ran for the presidency in 1960.

On the evening of June 4, 1968 she went to the Am-
bassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California to see Senator ROBERT
F. KENNEDY give his speech at the hotel. She arrived at the
hotel at about 11:30 p.m. and she immediately went to the Embassy
Room where the senator was scheduled to deliver his speech.
While giving his speech she noticed an Arabic looking man,
walking through the crowd assembled in the Embassy Room. She
described this individual as a man in his late 20's, 5'8",
dark curly hair, dark eyes, dark complexion, medium build and
wearing a white shirt, black pants and coat. This man did not
have any campaign buttons on or literature on his person.

When asked how she knew this individual was of Arabic
nationality, she replied that she could tell a person's nation-
ality by his hair and facial features. She volunteered that she
speaks French, English, Hebrew, Russian, Serbo -~ Cyédétian fluent-
ly and therefore knows an individual's nationality when she first
meets the individual. She did not observe this man talking to
anyone else in the crowd and commented that he did not seem to
fit with the crowd in the Embassy Room because of his dress. After
Senator KENNEDY finished his speech he left the podium. She
stated that she observed this man follow the crowd towards the
door through which Senator KENNEDY made his exit.

Approximately ten minutes after the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY this same man bumped into her as they were both leaving
the Embassy Room and he made the remark, “Let me go, I've got
to go". She did not see where this man went after he bumped
into her. She stated she would be able to recognize this individ-
ual if she were to see him again. She did not see SIRHAN SIRHAN

no more of it. She stated she also observed a nice looking

company of a Latin appearing individual, who is not identical

to comment on the individuals, not because she had any indication
that they may be involved in the assassination, but only because
their appearance and movements seemed suspicious to her.

Mrs. URSANO stated shortly after the speech she heard
what, sounded like balloons exploding, followed by screaming,
indicating that Senator KENNEDY had been shot and was bleeding.
She stated she did not see the Senator after his speech and
