DONALD WICKSON, Apartment 9, 5922 Gregory
Avenue, Los Angeles, telephone 466-.0550, telephoned the
FBI office in response to an attempt to contact him at
his apartment by Special Agent LESLIE F. WARREN on the
previous day. Mr. WICKSON said that he had no additional
information to add to his previous interview conducted by
the FBI with respect to the shooting of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY. WICKSON claimed that he had been employed at the
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, at the time Senator KENNEDY
was shot, as a waiter and had been in the room on the first
floor below the Embassy Room at the time of tne actual
shooting and had not observed any activity before or after
the shooting, which, in his opinion, was related to it.
He continued that he had been examining photographs of
SIRHAN SIRHAN in the newspapers and on television to
ascertain if he may have observed SIRHAN at any time before.
He had reached the conclusion that he had never seen SIRHAN
SIRHAN at any time.

Mr. WICKSON said that while employed as a waiter
at the Ambassador Hotel, he had used the name of DONALD
DAVID EVANGELISTA. His true name, however, was DONALD
WICKSON, and he was born , at Worcester, PIl
Massachusetts, under this name. His reason for using the
name EVANGELISTA was that he had gotten into some trouble
with the police in Worcester, Massachusetts, which was now
straigntened out, and had switched to the name of EVANGELISTA.
He claimed to be presently using the name of WICKSON.

Mr. WICKSON related that he was currently attending
a work orientation program at the University of California
at Los Angeles, which was financed by the United States
Government. He expected to obtain a position with possibly
the California State Department of Employment or some related
type position when he finished the course, which would be
in the immediate future.
