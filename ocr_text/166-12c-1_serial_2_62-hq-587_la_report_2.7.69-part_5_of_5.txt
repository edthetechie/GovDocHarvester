VINCE _GIMARELLI

The following investigation was conducted by
SA JESSE V. MC NULTY at Burbank, California, concerning
VINCE GIMARELLT, who was reported by CECI DOUCET as present
at the Ambassador Hotel when Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
was assassinated:

On December 12, 1968, Mrs. SUR SUMMERS, Attendance
Clerk, Burbank High School; Mrs. HELEN FOGEL, Attendance Clerk,
John Burroughs High School; and Sister MARY CAROL, Bellarmine-
Jefferson High School, advised they have no record of a student
by the name of VINCE GIMARELLI. They could locate no record
of any student with a similar spelling.

No other high schools are located in Burbank.

On December 12, 1968, records of the Burbank Police
Department and Retail Merchants Credit Association failed
to show a record for VINCE GIMARELLI. :

A review of city and phone directories and a check
of all names in the X-cross directory on Frederick Street
failed to list a GIMARELLI family.

and Forged Check May Have Been Cashed By Sirhan", on Page 1,
Part IT. The article indicated that a forged check stolen
from a construction company was cashed in a grocery store
in Corona, California, in November 1966, by:'a man believed
to have been SITRHAN BISHARA STRHAN. The alleged forgery,
which was for $81.57, indicated that SIRHAN's name had
been typed onto a blank check, one of nine which had been
stolen from the Altfillisch Construction Company. The
article further indicated that at the time of the forgery,
STRHAN was working as an exercise boy at a ranch owned by
the Altfillisch Construction Company.

Information was received from the Los Angeles
Police Department on December 18, 1968, that investigation
had been completed concerning a check bearing SIRHAN BISHARA

Mr. GUISTOLISE said that approximately two months
before Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY was ixillec, TONY MUNNO had
introduced the chef of vhe above restaurant to GUISTOLISE while
at the restaurant. This chef was referred to as “Jimmy,
the Cook", also as “the Albanian," a male Caucasian, about 30
to 35 years of age. The chef had stated that he hada
friend who was interested in becoming a racetrack jockey,
and inasmuch as GUISTOLISE had done part-time work at the

the request. °

On November 22, 1968, Mr. GUISTOLISE said that
he had been thinking about the information he related on
November 19, 1968, and discussing it with his wife and had
reached the conclusion that Mr. MUNNO had not commented on or
mentioned SIRHAN SIRHAN and that it had been speculation
on the part of GUISTOLISE that the friend of the chef who
wanted to be a jockey, might be a friend of SIRHAN SIRHAN.
He claimed his only basis for this speculation was, "he just
put two and two together.”

The United States Secret Service Headquarters,
Washington, D. C., on October 28, 1968, furnished FBI
Headquarters, Washington, D. C., with a copy of a communication
addressed to "Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, National
Headquarters, Willard Hotel, Washington, D. Cc." The
communication was allegedly sent by SHARIF BISHARA SIRHAN
and postmarked at Pasadena, California, on October 22, 1968.

The return address was indicated as "Sharif B.
Sirhan, 696 E. Howard Street, Pasadena, California", and the
envelope was addressed to Mr. NIXON. The envelope contained
a two-page letter beginning with "How do you justify taking
one land from one people..." and ending with "For the sake
of justice and the world peace, thank you".

This letter was forwarded to the FBI Laboratory
for examination and the Laboratory has identified it as
Qc35.

Additional writings of SHARIF and SATDALLAH

SIRHAN were obtained and forwarded to the FBI Laboratory
for comparison purposes on November 15, 1968.

Result of examination:

. The "Sharif B. Sirhan" signature on Qc35 is entirely
too indistinet to permit suitable comparison with the writing on
specimens Ke25 and Ke26. Therefore, a definite conclusion was
not reached whether the signature on Qc35 was written by either
