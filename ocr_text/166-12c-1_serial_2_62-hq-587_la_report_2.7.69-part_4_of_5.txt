the Jackson Office of the FBI, identifying herself

as Miss SUBRINA DUBLE, age 17. She refused to furnish

her address or telephone number, but stated her call was
to furnish the FBI with information concerning the

a rambling episode of how she met an individual whom

she had cause to believe was involved in the assassination
of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

Another call was received from this individual
by the Jackson Office of the FBI on October 16, 1968, and
on October 19, 1968, she telephonically contacted an Agent
of the FBI at Biloxi, Mississippi. On neither call did
she furnish further information.

On December 3, 1968, LEE JOSEPH PITTS, JR., age 17,

Office of the FBI identifying himself as a 17-year old

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TEDDY MARIE NAFIUS, 1518 Diamond Avenue, was
interviewed at her residence, at which time she furnished
the following information:

During April and May of 1968, she worked as a
volunteer for Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. During this time
she worked out of the campaign headquarters, which was located
on Wilshire Boulevard. On the night of Senator KENNEDY'S
assassination, she was at the Ambassador Hotel, however, at
the time of the shooting, she was in the downstairs ballroom
and not in the vicinity of Senator KENNEDY. She could furnish
no information as to the circumstances surrounding the
shooting.

She said that in talking with some of her friends
who were also volunteers for KENNEDY, she had learned that
the FBI had been attempting to identify various people who
were around Senator KENNEDY at the time of the shooting. In
observing some photographs in the June 14, 1968 "Time"
magazine, she noticed a Jordanian, known to her as ALI AHMAND,
standing on the podium near Senator KENNEDY, just prior to
the time when he went into the kitchen. It appeared in the
photograph that AHMAND was attempting to take photographs.

She had met AHMAND in May 1968 at a party held by
the Volunteers for KENNEDY, after the Indiana Primary Election.
She believed this party was on May 7, 1968, at the Ambassador.
Hotel. In talking with him, she learned that he was a
Jordanian, that he had been in Los Angeles for two or three
years, and although he was not actually working for Senator
KENNEDY, he was interested in the pol#®ital process in America,
and that was the reason he cameto the party at the Ambassador
Hotel. They discussed foreign policy and various aspects of the
American political scene. During this discussion, AHMAND
made no comment which indicated he had any particularly militant
attitudes towards any American politicians.

NAFIUS advised that she did not know AHMAND!S
address, although he had told her that he was working at
fkheredobs.. in South Pasadena, California. She advised that
she had no particular reason for bringing this to the attention
of the FBI, since AHMAND did not express any violent opinions,
but merely mentioned it because her friends had said that the
FBI was trying to identify the Jordanian in the "Time" magazine
photograph. This photograph appeared on page 17 of the June 14

ws The Directie Politie furnished the following infor-
“mation which ait said had been developed by the police of
Utrecht:

The postmark on the envelope of the letter to the
subject shows the posting date to be June 21, 1968, The
letter was without doubt posted in Utrecht on that date and
canceled at the Main Post Office in Utrecht between 10:00 A.M.
and 11:00 A.M. The stamps on the envelope are of a special
series which were issued in the Netherlands only between
May 1, and May 28, 1968) The postage was insufficient since
the charge for a letter directed to the United States, not
exceeding twenty grams in weight, is 45 cents.

The. name ESBES was searched through’ the records of
the Register Office in Utrecht, and the Central Civil Registry
in The Hague, with negative results. It can be said, therefore,
that no person utilizing this name is registered as living in
the Netherlands, «

The address 51 Prins Bernhardplein, Utrecht, is
occupied by a branch post office. The manager of this branch
stated that it is unusual for letters to be directed to
General Delivery (Poste Restante) at this branch post office,
During the past year not a single letter addressed in this.
manner has been handled by this branch, Inquiries at the
Main Post Office in Utrecht revealed that there was no infor-
mation of any mail being handled through General Delivery
there for a Mr. ESBES,.

2

Mention is made in the letter of a daughter of the ~
sender who was born on | Efforts to identify.
the writer through this indicated birth of his daughter proved
to be negative.

: It has not been possible for the police in Utrecht

to identify the writer. of. the.letter to.the subject, The
Utrecht Police believe it to be a hoax letter and the name
ESBES to be fictitious. : They suggest the possibility that

the name may have been devised from the initials of the
subject, S.B.S., which phonetically might be written as es-b-es,

The Directie Politie said that a man named Alwin

and now living in Amsterdam, Netherlands, is known to them.
through its records, A few years ago, Wolfgang, who is
“regarded as probably mentally disturbed, wrote letters to
persons who were involved in sensational cases, One such
letter was addressed to Mrs, J, D, Tippit, widow of the police
officer who was shot and killed during the investigation
immediately following the assassination of President John F,
- Kennedy, In view of this, the police in Amsterdam were asked
to make inquiries to determine whether Wolfgang could have
written the letter addressed to the subject. The Directie
- Politie furnished an English-language translation of the
report of the Amsterdam Police reflecting the results of
those inquiries, A copy of that report is incorporated as

It was previously reported that SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN was acquainted with WALTER S, CROWE, JR., when both
were attending Pasadena City College, Pasadena, Galifornia,
in 1965. During interview of CROWE by Special Agents
of the FBI on June 7, 1968, he admitted being active in
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), at Pasadena
City College in 1965. CROWE admitted having known STRHAN
since both were in the sixth grade in Pasadena, but that
he and SIRHAN were not close friends. CROWE advised that
SIRHAN did not support him in any of his clubs or activities
and CROWE did not attempt to recruit SITRHAN into the
Communist Party. CROWE further advised during the interview
that he had not seen SIRHAN since May 1968.

The Communist Party has been designated by
the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450. A characterization of SDS is

APPENDIX :

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOOCLETY

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it
is known today, came into being at a founding convention held
at Port Huron, Michigan, in dune, 1962. ‘The SDS is an association
of young people on the left and has 2 current program of protesting
the draft, promoting a campaign for youth to develop a conscientious
objector status, denouncing United States intervention in the war
in Vietnam, and to "radically transform" the university community,
and provide for its complete control by students. GUS HALL,
General Secretary, Communist Party, USA, when interviewed by a
representative of United States International in San Francisco,
California, on May 14, 1965, described the SDS as a part of the
"yesponsible left" which the Party has "going for us". At the
June; 1965, SDS National Convention, an anti-communist proviso
was removed from the SDS constitution. In the October 7, 1966,
issue of "New Left Notes", the official publication of SDS, an
SDS spokesman stated that there are Some communists in SDS and
they are welcome. The national headquarters of this organization
. as of dune 24, 1968, was located in Room 206, 1608 West Madison
Street, Chicago, Illinois.

A source, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, furnished the following information concerning
the relationship between WALTER SHERRILL CROWE, JR. and
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN on January 23, 1969:

CROWE and SIRHAN were close friends during
grade school and high school days to the point where they
exchanged such things as phonograph records. During this
period, CROWE was not a member of the Communist Party,
-but he was a socialist in his thinking.

Source advised that in May 1968, CROWE spent
an evening with SIRHAN, and that following this meeting
CROWE felt that SITRHAN had become stagnant and despondent
and had not advanced in his political thinking. CROWE
felt that because he, CROWE,-had gone to college, he had
progressed politically and intellectually, and that he and
STRHAN had nothing in common. CROWE told source that SIRHAN
thought politically along Marxist lines in that he believed
there is a ruling class and that imperialism does exist,
‘but that SIRHAN was not a political activist. CROWE felt
that SIRHAN was despondent bec@use of the Arab problems,
which SIRHAN blamed on United States support for Israel.

Source said that CROWE lived at his family's
home, 1300 Topeka Street, Pasadena, California, following
his graduation from the University of California at Los
Angeles (UCLA), in the spring of 1968 until about June 10,
1968, when he moved into the cooperative et UCLA. CROWE
stayed at the cooperative during the summer quarter of 1968,
although he was not attending the university, and CROWE
‘then returned to live “at his family's home.

Source further advised that CROWE attended
Communist Party meetings until October 1968. Source
advised that CROWE did not attempt to recruit STRHAN into
the Communist Party at any time, and that SIRHAN never discussed
Senator KENNEDY with CROWE.

It has been established that Crowe and Sirhan met at Bob's
Restaurant in Pasadena on the evening of May 2, 1968. Whether

at that time and place Sirhan discussed his intention to shoot
Senator Kennedy had to be resolved. Considerable time was

spent with Crowe discussing the events and the conversation that
took place on that evening. He xvecalled that they discussed the
Avab-~Israeli conflict and Sirhan asked questions about his
political activities. Crowe informed him that @uring the years

of 1966 and 1967 he became an active member of the Communist Party.
He believes that he may have tried to interest Sirhan in the Party,
but it appeared to him that Sirhan was "turned off" and the subject >
was later dropped.

Sirhan also mentioned that he wanted to become a millionaire and
discussed horse racing. He related a fall that he had suffered
while riding a horse in Corona, California.

Crowe described Sirhan as having racist attitudes. He was strongly
‘anti-Jewish and made statements about considering Hitler a hero.

He started discussing politics, saying that politics was part of
his whole commitment in life and explained that Israel could not
be defeated militarily in the Middle East. Crowe stated that he
told Sirhan that in his mind Al Fatah had created a political
movement among the Arab people in Israel giving them a political
voice in their move to deZionize the Israeli state.

“Mach of this information was vague in Crowe's. mind, but ‘when he -
was specifically asked whether Sirhan mentioned Senator Kennedy on '
that evening, Crowe replied that it was possible Kennedy could :

“have been mentioned, but

he covld not honestly remember. Crowe

“was then asked if he remembered Sirhan making any statement about
eradicating, assassinatipg, shooting, bombing, or in any way
eliminating anyone in polit tical office in this country. Crowe

“responded in the negative..

He said that to the best of his

nd procedures to be followed during the
“course .of the examination were reviewed with Crowe.

He was given:

an opportunity to ask questions concerning the testing technigue
and then two polygrams were obtained to detexmine whether Crowe
was a proper subject capable of being examined instrumentally. :
These control tests indicated that Crowe was responding phys lologi cally
to the controlled stimuli and that he was,a proper subject fit for ;

examination.

Crowe was very cooperative, he followed instructions,

“> and his attitude and demeanor were good. . One zone control test was

administered... This test contained the following 12 questions, seven
_ of which were irrelevant questions and five of which were relevant
to the issue of Senator*Kennedy's assassination:

QUESTION
Is your true first name Walter?

Is your true last name Crowe? — — tae

If I ask you questions about Sirhan,

‘will you tell me the txruth?

“Do you believe that I will be completely

officer about something important? 7 No

ll. Do you know why Kennedy was shot? . . No

12. To your knowledge was Sirhan a member

During the course of the examination, Crowe emitted deceptive
physiological responses at points where Questions 3, 6 & 8, the crucia
key questions, were asked. These responses are consistent with decep-.
tion but could also be attributed to the phychological involvement of
the subject. Specificaliy, such indices appeared when Crowe answered
that Sirhan had never told him that he was planning to shoot Kennedy.

Upon conclusion of this series of questions, it was evident that, the
test would not continue satisfactorily until these issues were discussed
with Crowe.

Crowe was advised that his responses to the key questions thus far, were
indicative of either deception or quilty knowledge on his part. He
expressed great concern over his feelings and admitted that he firmly
believed he had cast a strong impression over Sirhan. His influence
had, in Crowe's opinion, been a determining factor in Sirhan's decision
to commit the assassination. Crowe was reminded that prior to being
examined instrumentally on the polyexaph he had stated that it was
possible, but that he did not recall whether he and Sirhan had discussed
Senator Kennedy on the evening of May 2, 1968. However, he was told
that his responses definitely indicated that he did remember discussing
Kennedy with Sirhan. Crowe replied by saying "Yes, there was conver-
sation about Kennedy. God, I mean, he could have said something, you
know 'Well, Walt, you know, "Walter, if somebody should shoot that
bastaxd", and I'm afraid that you will ask me to what degree did I
influence him." Crowe was questioned additionally concerning his
acknowledged guilt feelings an@ other conversation that he may have

had with Sirhan. :

CO.

Captain \Hugh I. prow : ~4- . “ @ secenber 12,,1968
| ;

He related that he had discussed Al Fatah with Sirhan. He told
Sirhan that the struggle inside Israel was going to be a long, long
thing; that it was akin to a liberation struggle and would have to

be resolved by war. He told Sirhan that Al Fatah had given the Arab
people new morale. In discussing Al Fatah and their guerilla acti-
‘vities, Crowe felt that his statements could have put some terroristic
ideas into Sirhan's head and Crowe speculates that due to Sirhan's
‘actions end demeanor at float time, Sirhan could have seen himself as

a revolutionary fighter and decided to commit his act.

At this point of the examination, xowe / requested the time. It was
10:30 p.m. Crowe said that he had decided not to discuss the matter
..further. He said that he felt it was against his interest to say
anything further until he had time to consult with his attorney

ideally more questions should have been asked to acquire sufficient
physiological tracings for adequate comparative evaluation. However
due to the circumstances, this could not be accomplished. There was
no opportunity to ask questions pertaining to Crowe's personal’ invol-
vement in the assassination, consequently ‘there is no critcria on
which to form an Antelligent opinion as to.any criminal participation
on his part.

Based on the available polygrams, the only sound conclusion that can
-be reached is that Sirhan made some statement to Crowe regarding his
intent to kill Senator Kennedy. Whether or not this was a causual
statement or a detailed discussion cannot be ascertained from the test.
