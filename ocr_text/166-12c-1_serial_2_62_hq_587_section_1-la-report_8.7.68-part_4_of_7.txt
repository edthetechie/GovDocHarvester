with respect to his Knowledge of the events on June 4 and
June 5, 1968, surrounding the shooting of Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California:

On June 4, 1968, he went to the Embassy Room at the
Ambassado to cover Senator KENNEDY. While there, he
met ME J 5 representative of the" Afro-American"
newspaper published in Washington, D.C., but who is an employee
of that paper's Baltimore Office. He also met —_a
a director of the Negro Industrial Economic Union (NIEU).
Prior to the speech by Senator KENNEDY, at approximately midnight,
he wandered back and forth in the ballroom. He also wandered
back and forth during much of the speech.

Just as Senator KENNEDY appeared in the ballroom and
started speaking, he tried to make a telephone call to his
employer from the press telephones in the Embassy Room to
inform him that Senator KENNEDY was making a speech. There
was no answer at his office, so he continued to listen to the
Senator's speech. Just prior to the end of the speech, he
was on the Senator's left at the edge of the stage where there
was a guard. He used his press badge to get by the guard.

He thought that he would proceed through the kitchen area to the
KENNEDY press room,which was located at the far end of the
kitchen passageway. He thought at the time that the Senator
would leave the area through the main doors to his right. The
Senator started to leave the platform by going to his right
but_then reversed his direction and went to his left. He

When he ( ) started to go through the kitchen
passageway, he noticed approximately seven to ten individuals

appearance, he thought that they were all kitchen help. The
Senator proceeded into the kitchen passageway and shook hands
and greeted several individuals who clustered around the
doorway waiting to meet the Senator. As he (AMMEN) continued
through the kitchen area, he was bumped into by someone who jumped
from one of the steam tables but he does not recall what this
individual looked like or how he was dressed. The next thing
he recalls is that he heard several loud noises which sounded
like firecrackers. There was one distinct blast, a pause,
and then five or six other blasts in rapid succession. He
then determined that shots were being fired and he noticed
that Senator KENNEDY was lying on the floor with his head toward
the ballroom, parallel to the passageway. He does not recall
seeing SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN but as soon as he noticed what
was happening, he shoved a young female Caucasian who was on his
left out of the passageway. He then proceeded to the passageway
into the area where the KENNEDY press room was located and
informed the room full of newsmen that the Senator had just
been shot.

He immediately returned to the kitchen area and
noticed that two of Senator KENNEDY's aides were struggling
with SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN trying to get a gun away from him.
He climbed onto the steam table as the struggle continued.
From that observation point he noticed one of the hotel employees
place a white hat or towel under the Senator's head. He climbed
from the table and went close to where the Senator was lying
and was beside the Senator on the Senator's left side when he
noticed the Senator lower his right arm. He does not recall
hearing any words spoken by him but noticed that he was conscious.

As he was kneeling close to the Senator he said a
short prayer and he was then yanked from behind and physically
removed from the area. He was then ushered to a small hallway
which intersected the kitchen passageway and remained there while

he noticed that the Senator was removed from the area by several
ambulance drivers. Following the removal of Senator KENNEDY
from the area, he (AMMEEM was asked by an officer of the Los
Angeles Police Department whether he saw anything pertinent

and he said, voluntarily, that he did.

He was then ushered to another area of the hotel and
shortly thereafter transported to the Rampart Division of the

B HEB wire of CRA actor,

attended the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign party at the
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, on the evening of
June 4, 1968, and the early morning of June 5, 1968. They had
been in the Embassy Room at the hotel at the time of the
shooting of Senator KENNEDY and consequently had not observed
it or the immediate aftermath.

During a period about half an hour before Senator
KENNEDY arrived for his speech in the Embassy Room, she was
separated from her husband. She, at that time, observed a young
man who resembled the photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN. He was
standing at the foot of some stairs which led from the Embassy
Room to an area below where a number of Mexican Americans had
assembled to welcome Senator KENNEDY. When standing in front
of the podium from which Senator KENNEDY spoke, this stair would be
to the left rear of the podium and in the rear corner of the rogm.

Following examination of photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN
and his brothers, she was of the opinion that the man she saw
just standing at the foot of the stairs could have been SIRHAN
SIRHAN. She could not say for sure. He had dark curly hair,
was of swarthy complexion, and slight of stature.

The only thing she observed of possible note was a
young man who had earlier been trying to gain entrance to the
Embassy Room at the main entrance. No one else was allowed in as
the room was over crowded. He was white, age about 19 years,
small, dark, and thin with curly hair. He was carrying what
appeared to be campaign posters or literature. His dress was
