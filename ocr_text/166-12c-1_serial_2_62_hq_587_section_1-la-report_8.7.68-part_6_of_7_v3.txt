s centnrasy is of the opinion that the path taken
by Senator KENNEDY in leaving the platform was not the

u
planned route of exit as oe El who handled such things

had indicated a path to Senator KENNEDY's right off the
platforn.

This was the biggest crowd of the campaign.
Usually in entering or leaving a crowd, Senator KENNEDY
would go right through the thickest part. on this occasion,
before entering the ballroom; Senator KENNEDY asked E
if there was a backway in. This was the first time
that. HM can recall Senator KENNEDY going in the
backway. :

Also in leaving by the backway, a thinks
that Senator KENNEDY may have been tired or probably he

wanted to get to "The Factory" where he was going to sive
a party for his staff and the pres

heard of no threats as to Senator KENNEDY's
life, but he was fearful that something might happen to hin
as he (Senator KENNEDY ) would put himself in dangerous
situations, That is he might fall out of the car or some
such thing. A few weeks before this, Senator KENNEDY chipped
aitooth in a crowd.

following behind Senator KENNEDY's party through the kitchen
area near the Embassy Room. He had been standing in the
area to the side. of the speaker's stand on which the exits
were located. He was standing on a chair between the exit
and the ABC television camera and when Senator KENNEDY made
his exit, he shook hands with him. He followed behind the
group that was with Senator KENNEDY and heard what he, at
first, thought to be firecrackers. He saw the commotion
and realized it was shooting at which time he ducked behind
a refrigerator. He noticed Mr. PRs with whom he
had been acquainted, lying on the floor eeding from a wound
in his head. He cushioned his head and attempted to keep
Mr. SHE from further injury from the crush of the crowd.

where Senator KENNEDY was shot:

At approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. on June 4, 1968,
he went to the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel. He
stayed there until the speech,and he was on the platform,
during the Senator's speech, directly behind the Senator and
next to ci: Due to the mobility on the stand
he does not recall who was close to him during the fs
speech.

The original exit plan was for the Senator to go to
his right into the press room area and then back through the
kitchen area to toe Colonial Room. Just prior to the ending’ of the
speech, DD one of the Senator's assistants, asked
him how they would make their exit from the stage. They
decided to make a corridor so the Senator could exit in that
direction; however, the Senator went through the curtains
directly behind him. He said he followed the Sanator and was
just about to proceed from the semi-room area, behind the
curtains, into the kitchen passageway through a doorway when
an individual with a portable television camera came ints the
area. He held the door for this individual and then proceeded
behind the Senator who was approximately 25 feet in front of
him.. He noticed that the Senator shook hands with several
employees in the kitchen area.

The next thing he knew was that he heard a sound which
sounded like a firecracker. There was a loud sound followed
by Several rapid firecracker type sounds which he later learned
were shots. He noticed slight wisps of smoke rise from the
‘general area where the Senator was and that the Senator turned
slightly ts his left. After the first shot had been fired, he
did not realize that it was a shot; however, by the third shot
he then realized that shooting, in fact, was taking place.

later learned was SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and then R
G| and RQ OM) grabbed SIRHAN. G§MMplaced a "bear
hug around SIRHAN lifting him off the floor and placing him
along side the ice machine in the kitchen passageway. SIRHAN
was fighting very hard and put up a tremendous struggle for
such a small. man. He noticed that SIRHAN had a gun in his hand
but that he was quickly subdued.

He observed HE s and noticed that he was
bleeding profusely,which gave m the impression that S
was injured more seriously than_the Senator. Several people
immediately gave attention to Si following the shooting.
He noticed that the area was one of general confusion, that
there were individuals on the steam tables, and that calls
for doctors were going out. He and several other volunteers
1 crowd made a semi-circle isolating the Senator and
a from the rest of the crowd. Many cameramen and
television reporters were pushing and shoving, trying to get
on the scene. They permitted one fat Jewish doctor to the
area followed by another Jewish doctor with a medium frame then
a third doctor named MMB arrived on the scene. He could
see the Senator from his position in the semi-circle around
him and noticed that the Senator's eyes were open and that
there was lateral mobility in them. The Senator's eyes became
glazed and finally closed. H iced several individuals
kneeling by the Senator and . | but he does not recall who
they were.

He next recalls pb hk  &£ coming into the area
followed by SMEBBSMBMM, the Senator's brother in-law, and
several other doctors. The doors to the area were then closed,
and calls were made for ice, shéets, and tablecloths. It was
then that most of the employees were cleared from the area.
During this period he also observed several of the other
victims who had been shot. One individual,who had been shot
in the leg, was sitting in the corner while the ABC television
man,who was shot,was lying on the floor. He also saw the
middle aged woman, who had been shot being led from the area
with blood on her’ forehead. Someone went for a stretcher, or
went for material to make one, but at that time an ambulance

arrived and_the Senator was removed. Another ambulance also
came ana PRS and the other victims were removed. It
was then that the Los Angeles Police Department arrived in
force, isolating the area. He stated that previously there
were several officers in the area.

He recalls that when the shooting occurred, someone
made the comment that either he, she, or they were getting
away. He does not recall seeing a female Caucasian dressed
in a polka dot dress in the area. He noticed also that all
the kitchen help appeared to be Spanish-Americans, He was
shown a photograph of STRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and he advised
that several weeks prior to the shooting of Senator KENNEDY,
the Senator spoke at Temple Isaiah in Los Angeles and that
the stage area from which Senator KENNEDY spoke had seven
permanent chairs on it. Several of the chairs, to the Senator's
left as he addressed the audience,were vacant. As the Senator
addressed the audience, a white male in nis early 20s, 5 feet
3 inches ~ 5 feet 6 inches tall, 130 - 145 pounds, swarthy
complexion, and dressed in blue jeans and a white "T" shirt
came onto the stage and occupied one of the permanent chairs
to the Senator's left. He stated that this individual bears
an extremely close resemblance to SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and
in his opinion could be identical to him. He stated that
at this speech many newsmen were present and that he is certain
thet films were made of the speech, anc that perhaps a review
of those films would identify the individual as described
above.

vr. PR» Reporter for "The Los
Angeles Times", who resides a
Los Angeles, telephone number voluntarily furnished

the following information:

On June 4, 1968, he was assigned by his paper
to cover the MAX RAFFERTY function at the Ambassador Hotel.
He recalled arriving at the hotel at approximately 5:00 PM,
He obtained the necessary RAFFERTY and KENNEDY press cards
and, for a period of several hours, he moved about the
various rooms designated for the different political parties,
such as the Regency Room, the Embassy Room and the Colonial
Room, At approximately 11:00 PM, he was in the Colonial
Room, which was reserved for members of the press and heard
Senator KENNEDY's speech on television. He did not go into
the Embassy Room during Senator KENNEDY's speech. The
people in the Colonial Room received word at the end of
Senator KENNEDY's speech that the Senator was coming to the
Colonial Room. He does not recall who brought this message
but assumes that it was one of the KENNEDY aides. This
was shortly after midnight.

In the early morning of June 5, 1968, shortly
after they received word that Senator KENNEDY was coming to
the Colonial Room, he heard a rapid series of muffled pops,
perhaps six of these sounds. He immediately felt that the
sounds were gunshots. The door between the Colonial Room
and the kitchen was closed. He immediately rushed from the
Colonial Room into the kitchen in time to see Senator
KENNEDY slumping to the floor. He recalled seeing blood
on the right side of the Senator's face and noticed a strong
light, possibly a television light, shining in the area
of the Senator.

He did not see suspect SIRHAN SIRHAN initially
upon entering the kitchen or observe the struggle in which
the suspect was originally involved in after the shooting.

A short while later, he did see the individual later identified
as suspect SIRHAN SIRHAN pinned down on the service counter
in the kitchen. SIRHAN was surrounded by approximately
eight people who were holding him securely. The aS ae
still had a pistol in his hand. Later, he saw that R
GMM was holding the short snub nose pistol. Mr. H
stated that he did not see the actual shooting nor the
original scuffle with the suspect in which the suspect was
apprehended. Mr. H was unable to say from his own
personal knowledge at suspect SIRHAN actually fired the
gun. The individual who was being restrained was the same
individual arrested by the police later and subsequently
identified as SIRHAN SIRHAN,.

HEMI recalled that there were perhaps a
total of 4 people in the Colonial Room. Most of the people
were news people and included several women operating teletype
machines. He did recall seeing a few people in the room
whom he thought at that time were not associated with the
news media.

He recalled recognizing the following news people
in the Colonial Room:
