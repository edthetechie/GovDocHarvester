The Honorable Richard M. Nixon
President Of the United States

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. President:

T am most concerned with the taxes it is costing the
California tax payers in the Sirhan Sirhan case of which
you are aware of in the assination of Senator Kennedy.
They say this conviction will be in court three months.
WHY? He has admitted his guilt, and was caught in the
act. Why do we law abideing citzens have to pay for this?
Our taxes is so high now in the San Fernando Valley that
we just can't afford to live in the house we bought for
13,000 9 years aro. My Husband served in World War LL
and we have been since 19.7 trying to own a home. Can't
something please be done? We are past 50 years old now
and would like to have a home in our later years instead

of a room or rest home. TI do thank you for takeing the

time for my complaint.

Yours, truly

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
Washington, D. C. 20530

March 17, 1969
MEMORANDUM TO ALL EMPLOYEES

SUBJECT: Blood Donor Program

The next scheduled date for blood donations is Monday, March 2h, 1969,
in the Main Justice Building (Great Hall), beginning at 10:00 a.m., and
ending at 4:00 p.m.

Since you are an employee of the Department, which is a member of
the Blood Donor Program, you and certain members of your family (spouse,
children under 18, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents) are entitled
to receive any amount of blood you may require without cost provided the
Department has met or is relatively close to meeting its established
yearly quota of 700 pints. To receive this service, all you have to do
is call the Employee Relations Unit, in the Main Justice Personnel Office,
and your needs will be met.

Thus far in this fiscal year, the Department is so far below its
donation quota that the Red Cross has informed us that we are in danger
of losing our privilege of unlimited coverage for employees and the
eligible members of their families. Unless we can come very close to
our quota, we will be able to fill blood needs only to the extent of
the number of pints donated by our employees. This will prove a great
hardship to the many employees who will have need of unlimited coverage.
Therefore, we ask you to please volunteer to give blood if you are
physically able to do so.

Your blood recruiting officer will contact you within the next few
days. If he should miss you, please notify the Employee Relations Unit,
Code 187, Extension 3143,

Transportation will be provided for groups of five or more donors
stationed in other buildings. Employees in the following locations
should contact the persons listed who will arrange for tranportation:

101 Indiana Avenue (HOLC) and 3rd and Constitution Ave., N.W. -
Frances Martinez, Code 187, Ext. 3143

119 "D" Street, N. E. -
Virginia Gogel, Code 155, Ext. 348

1405 Eye Street, N. W. (Benjamin Franklin Building) -
