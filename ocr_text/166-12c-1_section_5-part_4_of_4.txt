Sirhan Trial Pace Typical Of U. S. Justice

By RICHARD STARNES
Scripps-Howard Staff Writer

LOS ANGELES — The mur-

der of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
was not a typical crime in the
epidemic of wrongdoing that is
- lacerating the nation, and his

admitted killer is not a run-of--

the-mill hoodium.

But the glacial pace of the
trial of Sirhan B. Sirhan is
wholly characteristic of the
plodding deliberation with

Spree irNei ree tecat ae:

which criminal justice is dis-
pensed in the U.S.

Grant. B.. Cooper, the soft-
spoken, courtly — and, oh, so
cagey — chief defense counsel
for the accused assassin, has

“ conceded in open court that

his moody, whey-faced client
fired the shot that took the life
of Bobby Kennedy last June 5.

But despite that the trial of

Sirhan promises to last at
least another three months,

Sirhan was arraigned and
pled not guilty last Aug. 2.

' Trial was set for Nov. 1 and

was postponed twice. It start-

_ ed in the heavily guarded Su-

perior Court of Judge Herbert
V. Walker Jan. 7.

Three weeks later the jury
has not been finally selected,
and to all intents and purposes
the trial has not even started.

Today, as the lead-footed
proceedings resume after a
four-day recess, there were
still two time- -consuming pre-
fiminaries impeding the actual
rial,

Although eight men and four
women have tentatively been

“seated as jurors, six alter-

nates remain to be selected.
Since neither prosecution nor
defense has exhausted his per-
emptory challenges eboosing
the six alternates could drag
on for the rest of the week.

There is also one more mo-
tion to be argued, Mr. Cooper

and his two assistants today
will seek dismissal of Sirhan’s
indictment on the ground that
the grand jury that returned it
did not represent a fair cross
section of the community.
Substantially “the same argu-
ment was used in an earlier
motion to dismiss the petit
jury panel, and was rejected
by Judge Walker. (It was re-
newed the next day, and was
again rejected, but not until
the 69-year-old trial judge had
patiently listened to additional
arguments from Mr. Cooper.)
Mr. Cooper said he would
subpena more than 100 Los
Angeles County judges to sup-
port his plea to quash the

indictment — a plea observers *

felt was a doomed ploy intend- «
ed only to lay the groundwork
for an appeal if Sirhan is
convicted.

While California’s far-out
murder trial procedure is un-
doubtediy contributing to the
delay in Sirhan’s trial, delay
for delay’s sake is a time-hon-
ored weapon in the U. S. trial
attorney’s armory.

In California trials that re-
sult in a verdict of first-degree
murder, the trial jury must
then listen to additional evi- .
dence in mitigation or in ag-
gravation of sentence and then
must decide between life im-

. prisonment or death in the gas

chamber.

The “penalty” verdict must
be unanimous, just as the
guilty-not guilty-verdict must

be. This. doubles the possibility
of a hung jury and of a
mistrial, and it led to this
exchange between Mr. Cooper
and a reporter during a court-
house corridor interview:
What happens, Mr. Cooper
was asked, if the jury agrees
on a first-degree guilty verdict
but can’t agree when it later
must decide on penalty?
“It means,” Mr. Cooper re-
piled cheerfully, “‘that a whole
lew jury must be selected to
fix the penalty. And since the
new jury has not heard any of
the evidence, practically
everything can be -reintro-
duced — not just evidence in
mitigation or aggravation.”
California, however, has no
monopoly on endless criminal
‘trials. At the beginning of the
: current fiscal year there were
14,763 criminal cases pending
in Federal district courts, of
which nearly 2000 had been
. hanging fire for more than two
years, 2055 had been in litiga-
tion more than a year and 2408
had been pending more than

Se competes with ice cream
venders, booming jet
planes, and skippers sailin
their crafts in the Central
Park boat pond. But distrac-
tions or no, Diane Wolkstein
is still the park’s undisputed
Saturday star—and her re-
views are mostly raves.

Miss Wolkstein, ash blonde,
freckle-faced and 25 years
old, is the official storyteller
of the City of New York.

Each summer Saturday at
I] A.M. she appears at the
Hans Christian Andersen
statue just west of the boat
pond (near Fifth Avenue and
72d Street) and tells stories
to an enthralled audience for
45 minutes. _

She tells them as they have
probably ‘never been told be-
fore. She moans and groans
and laughs and cries and
grimaces and gestures and
shouts and whispers and
jumps and squats—and “me-
ows” so well that you look
around for a real kitten.

Encourages Involvement

But her forte is weaving in
and out among the tiny
chairs and touching the chil-
dren and encouraging their
involvement :in the stories.
One child recently became so
involved in a story about an
elephant and a butterfly that
he toppled off his chair and
ran crying to his nanny, who
was sitting on a bench on
the sidelines wishing she
could spin a tale like that.

“The only way to tell
stories out of doors is 'to
walk into the kids,” Miss
Wolkstein said recently after
a Saturday session. for: 100

them in. Otherwise the cor

taxes.” She became the city’s
first full-time professional
taconteur—an idea she sug-
gested hetself—following’ an
audition last summer in Cen-
tral Park,

During the week she tells
stories in schools, libraries,
‘parks, community centers and
children’s hospital wards ali
the way from Harlem to the
Lower East Side, and in the
Bedford-Stuyvésant area of
Brooklyn.

“it’s funny. the difference

between the white kids in
Central Park and the Negro
kids in the ghettos,” she said.
“The Negro kids are much
more responsive to the sto-
ries, and they read your face
better. They have more
savvy.”

- Away from her audience,
Miss Wolkstein is shy, in-
tense and vulnerable, and she

. worries constantly about her

performances. She gets up
around 8 A.M. on Saturdays,
gulps coffee to calm her
nerves, and then practices
about eight stories in front

of a mirror in her Greenwich -

Village apartment. She never
knows which ones she will

Wolkstein’s mood.

“I don’t tell ghost stories
or any that scare just for
scare’s sake,” she said. “But
you can tell a story where
there is some violence, as
long as it has the redeeming
factor of going someplace,
Like ‘Jack and the Bean-
stalk.”

The modern-day Schehera-
zade also likes folk tales
from other countries, which
she tells on her weekly radio
program, “Stories From
Many Lands.” It is broad-
cast over WNYC radio every
Saturday morning from 8 to
8:30.
