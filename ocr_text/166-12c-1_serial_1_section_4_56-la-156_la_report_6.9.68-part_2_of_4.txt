continued that the proprietor of this store was either a
German or Dutchman whose name was WIDNER (phonetic). This
individual, he stated, had written a book setting forth

how he had helped Jewish people during the war. MUNIR
SIRHAN stated that his brother, SIRHAN, had taken exception
to the publication written by WIDNER and that this had caused
a disagreement between them, and as a result, SIRHAN
terminated his employment at this location. MUNIR stated
that SIRHAN's objection to this book was based on his,
SIRHAN's, feeling against the Jewish people.

MUNIR stated that his brother, SIRHAN, although
living at home with his mother and other brother,had little
communication with the rest of the family which was a.cause
of friction between his mother and his brother, SIRHAN.

Further, he stated that to the extent of his
knowledge,his brother, SIRHAN, had no close male associates,
no female associates, and his brother did not drink or smoke.
His brother was a member of the Amroc Rosicrucians, a religious
society, and was also interested and had taken instruction in
the Seventh-Day Adventist religion. An individual representing
this latter faith used to come to the house once a week and
would discuss the bible with SIRHAN. SIRHAN was introduced
to this religion through his former employer at the health
food store.

Before their recent fight of about three months ago,
MUNIR stated that he and his brother, SIRHAN SIRHAN, would
go out occasionally and play a game of pool or sit and watch
television at the house. The only topics that STRHAN would
discuss were usually thoroughbred horses or his membership
in the Rosicrucians. Approximately a year ago, MUNIR stated
that his brother had tried to be an exercise boy and worked
at a ranch in Corona, California. While so employed, he
fell off a horse and hurt his head, as a result of which he
was hospitalized in Corona, and later, for a period of several
months, had to visit a doctor in Pasadena, California. He
filed a suit over this injury, but MUNIR did not know whether
or not his brother had ever collected any money as a result
of this legal action. To the extent of his knowledge, MUNIR


--- Page 31 ---
iA 56-156 Z

stated his brother, SIRHAN, did not belong to any racial,
social, or political organizations, and never engaged with
him in any political discussions, particularly concerning the
current primaries in which KENNEDY and other candidates were
engaged. He stated that his brother did read a great deal,
usually books on history or politics and did watch television,
but he had no idea of what his brother's preference on
television programs was. He stated that his brother usually
returned to the home late at night, and he would observe him
walk through the house usually with some newspapers in his arm.
He would normally go straight to his room and spend inmost of
the time when he was at home in his own room.

MUNIR stated that he knew that hig brother, SIRHAN,
had a handgun as several months ago his brother was reading
a rifle magazine of some type and asked him if he knew anybody
who knew about guns. MUNIR stated that he told SIRHAN that
a friend of his who worked at the same location knew about
guns. MUNIR said that SIRHAN had taken ROTC training at
Jonn Muir High School and said that he knew about guns and
wanted a gun to shoot on the pistol range. MUNIR disclaimed
that he had purchased this gun but stated that SIRHAN had
actually bought the gun from “GEORGE” whose last name he
did not know who worked at the Nash Department Store in
Pasadena. MUNIR stated that he only saw this gun on the
day that "GEORGE" sold it to STRHAN and claims not to have
seen it since that date. In fact, MUNIR stated, he made
SIRHAN swear on the grave of their dead sister that he would
only use the gun on the pistol range and would then get rid
of it.

MUNIR advised that his brother drove a 1957 De Soto,
which was pink and white in color, and that on the morning
of June 4, 1963, he saw his brother at approximately 8:20 a m
at the corner of Lake and Washington in Pasadena where his
brother was buying a newspaper. This was the last time he
saw his brother before the shooting of Senator KENNEDY
MUNIR stated that if hig brother did commit this act, he
does not believe he would have done it for any group or
individual as his brother had too determined a nature to do
' something such as this for some other person or group.

At that time he attempted to recruit SIRHAN SIRHAN into the

subversive activities. During their last contact, CROWE said
that SIRHAN was very dejected and frustrated, in that he
realized that he had made no progress economically or academically,
whereas CROWE had recently graduated from the University of

employed at the Santa Anita Race Track as a jockey or
exercise boy, but had been injured in a fall from a horse.
CROWE was quoted as having expressed apprehension that
SIRHAN SIRHAN, during questioning, might reveal’ his
relationship with CROWE and discuss CROWE's activities in
the CP.

A second confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on June 6, 1968,
that on December 4, 1963, a 1961 Volkswagen bearing the
then current California license plates JYT 417, registered
to ADEL BISHARA SIRHAN, 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena,
was observed in the vicinity of Baces Hall, 1528 North
Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, during the time a
meeting of the Citizens Committee to Preserve American
Freedoms was in progress at Baces Hall. (See appendix page
titled, "Southern Californians to Abolish the HUAC"). The
occupant of this vehicle was not observed by the source.

This source stated that the same automobile was
observed in the vicinity of Baces Hall on January 16, 1966,
while a meeting of the W.E.B, Du Bois Clubs of America (See
appendix) was in progress. The occupant of this vehicle was
not observed by the source.

Source one further advised on June 6, 1968, that
the former chairman of the Los Angeles Du Bois Club
(See appendix page captioned "W.E.B. Du Bois Glub of West
Los Angeles"), has reported, according to this source,
that he was the chairman of the Los Angeles Du Bois Club
before it dissolved in 1967. He stated he had no knowledge
of SIRHAN SIRHAN having been connected with the Du Bois
Clubs of America in any way. In the past, this confidential
source has submitted records of the membership of the Du Bois
Clubs in.Los Angeles. The name of SIRHAN STRHAN was not
included in any of those membership lists and SIRHAN SIRHAN
is unknown to this source.

Source one also stated that the former chairman of
the Los Angeleg Du Bois Club mentioned that members of the
leadership of the SCDCP had contacted him on June 6, 1968,
with reference to statements attributed to Los Angeles
Mayor SAM YORTY, which left the impression that STRHAN
SIRHAN was associated with the W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of
America. They reportedly expressed great concern and
inguired as to whether the chairman knew if SIRHAN SIRHAN had ever
had any contact with, or was a member of, the W.E.B, Du Bois
Clubs of America. The chairman also reported that DOROTHY
HEALEY, Chairman of the SCDCP, had called a meeting of key
members of the CP for the evening of June 6, 1958, to decide
what action, if any, should be taken to desclaim that SIRHAN
SIRHAN was affiliated with the W.E,B. Du Bois Clubs of America.
It was tentatively agreed that FRANKLIN ALEXANDER, former
national chairman of the W.E.B, Du Bois Clubs of America,
and current member of the CP, would go to Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc., in Los Angeles, together with ROBERT DUGGAN,
former chairman of the Los Angeles Du Bois Club and current
chairman of the Youth Commission, SCDCP, to deny that SIRHAN

WALTER SHERRILL CROWE, JR. advised he lives at
1300 Topeka, Pasadena, California, telephone SY 4-7064,
He is employed as a social worker in the Metropolitan Aid
to Totally Disabled Section of the Los Angeles County
Department of Welfare at 2615 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles.

On examining a set of photographs, he positively
identified SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN as a person he had known
in the Pasadena School District since the sixth grade. He
advised this acquaintance continued until both finished
two years at Pasadena City College (PCC). He advised that
they lived within two or three blocks of each other in
addition to attending the same school and that he knew
SITRHAN well but SIRHAN was not his best friend.

CROWE states in 1965, he left for college,
University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and claims
to have only seen SIRHAN once since that time, in March 1968.
He contacted SIRHAN because CROWE learned through his
mother, MARGARET CROWE, who is a member of the Westminster
Presbyterian Church on Lake Avenue in Pasadena, that MARY
SIRHAN, SIRHAN STRHAN's mother, indicated SIRHAN wanted to
see CROWE, When they met, they were together approximately
three hours during the evening. They went to two topless
bars in Pasadena and drank beer. They concluded the evening
by eating tacos at Ernie's Taco Restaurant on Colorado near
Fairoaks in Pasadena,

During their time together, CROWE told SIRHAN
about his schooling at UCLA, from where he had just
graduated. They talked about the Mid-East and politics.
CROWE claims to have not séen SIRHAN since that
meeting and denies having talked to him on the telephone
or having had’ any other ‘contacts.

SIRHAN counted heavily on Egyptian Premier NASSER and the

In March 1968, although still favoring a UAR victory, SIRHAN
seemed to have quieted down on the subject of Israel. He
did not feel the Israeli Territory could be freed by the
Arabs and that his general attitude towards Israel had
mitigated. SIRHAN indicated a dectréabing amount of interest
in politics and an ambition to get a job, although he told
CROWE he was always interested in “he politics of the

Near East.

CROWE stated that SIRHAN developed most of his
sentiment against Israel from his family and he feels that
SIRHAN had no stronger anti-Semitic feelings than did his
mother, MARY SIRHAN. He stated that SIRHAN never became
violent when arguing with him although he did argue strenuously.
CROWE always took the attitude that the Zionists need not
be driven into the sea but SIRHAN would argue excitedly in
favor of this action.

CROWE does not believe that SIRHAN ever smoked.
He was only a moderate drinker and then only rarely did he
drink. He knew some girls, dated some, but CROWE never
double dated with him.

CROWE feels that in March 1968, some kind of a
barrier had arisen between them at their meeting. He knew
that SIRHAN was probably jealous of his, CROWE's, education,
while SIRHAN had been thrown from a horse and could not be
a jockey. CROWE said he never saw SIRHAN outright mad,

CROWE recalled that SIRHAN stated in 1965 that he
was dropped from PCC but that he would come back and the
school would want him back. CROWE said he does.not feel SIRHAN
was politically motivated enough to murder Senator KENNEDY
but, in retrospect, realizes he must have been.

CROWE recalled that at PCC, probably sometime in
1964, he attended, with SIRHAN,a banquet at the YMCA in
Pasadena. This banquet was sponsored by the “Organization
of Arab Students" (OAS). CROWE believes there were only
four or five members of OAS at PCC but, at the banquet, there

2

were a large number and they were addressed by an Egyptian
Consul. - CROWE believes SIRHAN lost contact with other
Arab students and bases this on the fact that during Christmas
1967, while shopping in Bullock's '.. Pasadena, he met two
former Arab students from PCC, They had a friendly discussion
during which these Arab students asked CROWE if he had seen
SIRHAN,

CROWE stated that SIRHAN apparently had no opinion
on Negroes. He believes SIRHAN is a member of the Greek
Orthodox Church in Pasadena.

CROWE recalls two Arabs with whom SIRHAN was
associated at PCC. They are MUSTAFA SERMAIN (phonetic),
a student from Lebanon, and ABDUL DABBAS (phonetic), who
taught Arabic at PCC,

CROWE can recall no specific discussion of American
politics during the March 1968 meeting with SIRHAN., CROWE
formerly went to a rifle range run vy the City in Pasadena,
owned guns and was interested in marksmanship. He stated
that SIRHAN had absolutely no interest along these lines
when he knew him.

CROWE stated he can recall SIRHAN as being moody,
up one day and depressed the next. He tended to be withdrawn.
CROWE cannot think of any additional information regarding
SIRHAN but volunteered to communicate with the FBI if he
should think of anything and, further, he is available for
recontact at any time.

CROWE states SIRHAN SIRHAN knew about the formation
of this club but was apathetic and never helped or hindered,
did not join or offer to join the SDS club. At the end of
the 1965 academic year in June, CROWE finished at PCC and
in September began at the University of California at Los Angeles
(UCLA). He almost immediate’y joi:ed the UCLA chapter of the
W.E.B. Du Bois Club that was tnen active on campus. The next
year, sometime in 1966, he attendea the W.E.B. Du Bois Club
national convention in Chicago as a West Coast representative.
However, by late 1966 or early 1967, the W.5.B. Du Bois Club
had grown unpopular because the members at UCLA got tired of
it and it folded.

CROWE states that in April, 1967, he and seven
others formed a Student Club of the Communist Party, USA,
on the campus of UCLA. They met to discuss political
matters, he paid dues, but not to any national headquarters,
only in his group. He remained in this CP club until he was
graduated in March, 1968. He is still in the club, but
each of the other seven members graduated with him, and they
are considering forming an ex-student CP club. CROWE stated
joining the CP club was a natural extension of his membership
in the W.E.B. Du Bois Club.

With regard to SIRHAN, CROWE states he considered
him "erratic" in his political philosophy and though essentially
liberal and left of center, he had definite phases of his
thinking where he was right of center, particularly on the
subject of the state of Israel. When asked what he meant
by liberal, CROWE stated, "politically liberal." Pressed
for more definite information, CROWE states he does not
know SIRHAN's economic philosophy. Politically, SIRHAN
favored movements that according to CROWES are considered by
the general populece to be left of center. CROWEH states
SIRHAN was opposed to the Vietnam war,

While at PCC in 1965, CROWE recalls that SIRHAN
claimed he wanted to live in society in the United States
and get along with people and make money. SIRHAN wes not
interested in the SDS Club that CROWH wanted to form. Although
aware of CROWE's activities, STIRHAN did not support him, CROWE
cannot recall specifically discussing the formation of the
SDS group with SIRHAN although SIRHAN must have known. STIRHAN
would likely have been on the fringe of groups where CROWE
wes expressing a desire to form the club and where SIRHAN must
have overheard such expressions.

at UCLA after he left PCC and dropped out before his 1963
meeting with SIRHAN so that SIRHAN could not have known of
this club membership while CROWE was a member.

CROWE tried to fix the date he went out with SIRHAN,
that is, the first time he saw SIRHAN since 1965 which is
also the last time he ever saw or spoke to SIRHAN. CROWE
was interviewed on June 7, 1963. He believes the time he
went out with SIRHAN was four weeks and two days prior to
this date. CROWE looked at a calendar and stated tne date
was Friday, May 2, 19€8. CROWE recalled he began working
for Los Angeles County as a social worker the day before this
date, that is, Thursdey, May 1, 1968.

CROWE stetes he met SIRHAN about 8:00 p.m. just
as it was getting dark (daylight saving time had just gone
into effect). They met and ate dinner at Bob's, 161€ East
Colorado, Pasadena, California. They ate from 8:00 p.m.
to 9:90 p.m. During this time and since they had not seen
each other gince June, 1965, they exchanged personal infor-
mation, SIRHAN said he had been working with horses since
graduation, had fallen several times, was not currently
working, end had not completed his education. CROWE
then told SIRHAN about completing his BA work at UCLA,
about joining the W.E.B. Du Bois Club and the Student
Club of the CP,

CROWE states he told SIRHAN that the CP, USA
and the CP in Russia functioned differently and were not
the same group. He also mentioned to SIRHAN that the Russian
Government was supporting the Arabs with arms in the fight
against Israel, CROWE claims he did not directly tell SIRHAN
that the two CP's were in effect helping Russia which in
turn was helping the Arabs; however, he thinks it possible
this impression could have been perceived by SIRHAN, CROWE
asks the question how can he know what influenced SITRHAN,
SIRHAN never told him this was significant information, he
showed no surprise, gave no indication of startled enlighten-
ment, he accepted this information elong with other information
that CROWE was verbalizing.
