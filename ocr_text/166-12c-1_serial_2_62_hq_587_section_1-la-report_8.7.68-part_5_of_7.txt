JAMES C,. BUSCH, age 18, 4433 Colbath Street,
Apartment 2h, Sherman Oaks, California, telephone number
789-5312, furnished the following information with respect
Fo pis Knowledge of the shooting of Senator KENNEDY, June 5,
1955:

On June 4, 1968, after attending the Los Angeles
Dodgers-Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game with his sister, ANDREA
BUSCH, and a friend, RICHARD HARVEY RITTNER, they decided to
go to the Ambassador Hotel to see Senator K@NNEDY. He recalls
that on the inbound Hollywood Freeway, while listening to the
radio, they heard the opening comments by Senator KENNEDY.

He drove his car to the Ambassador Hotel and parked in the
rear parking lot facing south when the speech ended. When

' they vere ready to get out of the car, ne heard the commentator

on the radio state, "ve are returning to KENNEDY headquarters,
something hag happened", He then heard some screaming and
cotlmotion over the radio followed by some statements, “is
there a doctor in the house?" STiPPEN SMITH then got on the
air and because of his Bostonian accent tney thought ne was
Senator K@NNEDY. SMITH stated, “if you people don't clear
the area, we cannot get medical aid to the Senator." He algo

“told the people present to clear the area.

At aporo:imately that time he observed two individuals
walking quickly toward hie car through nis rear view mirror.
Both individuals passed the car heading south on nis, the driver's
side of the car, and as the second individual passed, he asked
him, “what happened?" This individual stated, "they shot nin
in the head. He's dead". He asked him how he knew thie and the
individual stated that ne was a busboy at the notel and that he
had just shaken Senator KENNEDY's hand. He also said, "I sar
the man pull out the gun and I hit the ground", He also said,
"they shot him. He's dead". As he stated this he demonstrated
the shooting by pulling out an imaginary gun from his left
trouser waietranG and placimg it to his right temple.

The other individual who accompanied the unknown
male was a female caucasian who etood on the driver's side
of the car just in front of the front wheel when the con-
versation took place. As soon as he finished asking questions
of the unknown male, both the male ana tne female continued
walking quickly toward the end of the varking lot ina
southerly direction.

The three of them then went to the Ambassador Hotel
and just as tney arrived there from the parking lot they
observed approximately five black and white patrol cars pull
up. There vere many people in the area and he recalls tnat
several women were crying and that one woman was quite
hysterical. They heard that more than one person
had shot Senator KENNEDY co his sister ANDREA euggested that
the two unknown individuals who had just passed the car,
appeared very strange to her. His sister then saw a plainclothes
policeman to whom they told the story. As soon ag the policeman
heard the story he waved two uniformed officers to him and
motioned to them the direction of the flight of the two unknown
individuals whom they nad seen.

After being interviewed in depth by the plainclothes
policeman they went into the hotel. His sister bought him and
his friend, RITTNER,a drink and they watched television at
various locations in the hotel, one being the RAFFERTY head-
duarters. Sometime during this period he telephoned his
father and told him that tne area nad been blocked off and that
he was unable to return home at that time.

He advised that the reason they had
talked to the policeman was that only two or three minutes had
elapsed from the time they had heard the shooting on the radio
until the time that they saw the two unknown individuals.

He has seen the photograph of JUAN ROMERO and
ROMERO does not resemble the unknown male individual whom
ne sar.

He described the unknown individual's as follows:

at any time during the evening nor does he recall seeing a
female in a polka dot dress. He advised that the unknown
female whom he saw could. have been wearing a polka dot dress
put he could not tell due to the coat she nas wearing.

TED CHARACH, 5712 La Mirada Avenue, Apartment 25,
Los Angeles, California, telephone 462-3421, when called for
an appointment related the following:

Mr. CHARACH said that he was a freelance communications
(voice man) who worked with some of the freelance recorders
and photographers including JEFF BRENT of Continental
Recordings. Concerning himself as a potential witness, Mr.
CHARACH said that during the actual shooting he was in the
Embassy Room and did not see the shooting nor did he see
SITRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN.

Immediately after the shooting, Mr. CHARACH
secured several names of persons in the crowd who claimed
to have seen the shooting. They are as follows:

GEORGE GREENE, a Negro, phone number 753-3305
JIM LOWE, phone number 296-3506

MIKE WAYNE, who had a Webster phone number, but
full number or address not obtained due to the
confusion

FRANK CONTE, who appeared to be known to one JOHN
MILMAN (phonetic) of the "Los Angeles Times"

CONTE was relating he has seen a "wild eyed man"
running out of the kitchen after the shooting. This statement
apparently had no connection with revealing a possible suspect
as it was later confirmed through statements made by persons presen?
that the man running was attempting to get to a phone to call
the ambulance. It was not known if CONTE was a first hand
witness to the shooting or not.

KADAR was a witness to the KENNEDY shooting
according to the statements he made at the scene when being
interviewed rather extensively by TV newsmen.

Mr, CHARACH said that automobile bumper stickers
pertaining to a conspiracy to kill JOHN F, KENNEDY were being
distributed in the parking lot and around the Ambassador
Hotel during the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY's campaign party
by persons not known to CHARACH. The latter obtained ondof these
bumper stickers which was taken away from him by MORT
GOODMAN of the Mort Goodman Company, a public relations
firm which handled the Ambassador Hotel account. GOODMAN
was in the press room at the KENNEDY party at the time and
was protesting against the circuPization of the bumper stickers.

There has been some hearsay statements around town
according to Mr. CHARACH that SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN and some
of his associates had about a year ago appeared on 4 Joe
Pyne TV Show on Channel 11, Los Angeles, this show at the time
peing produced by MARVE GRAY. This was about the time of the
outbreak of war in the Middle East.

Senator Robert F. Kennedy gave his victory speech follow-
‘ing the California primary election. At the time
Senator Kenriedy gave his speech, I was standing on the
steps of the podium, in the Embassy Room, from which he
gave his speech.

"After Senator Kennedy finished his speech, Jack
Gallivan, Mr. Uno, manager for the hotel, and I started
to lead the way toward the Colonial Room where Senator
Kennedy planned to thank the members of the press. As
we were passing through the kitchen area I heard a loud
pop, like a firecracker, from my rear and I turned around
to see what caused the noise. Senator Kennedy was
starting to fall to the floor and I saw a man holding a
black gun; the gun was going off and I could see fire coming
out the back. Almost at the same time men were grabbing
for the gun. I remeinber that a total of five shots were
being fired. By the time the last shot was fired, the
man holding the gun was subdued by several men, including
Rosie Grier, Rafer Johnson and Jack Gallivan.

A BAD NIGHT IN.

Ble LOS ANGELES

I. does not seem nearly so long ago as thirty years that d
trade of the foreign correspondent caught the fancy of the
Hollywood producers. And for good reason. Hitler was on the
loose, and Europe was crackling with crises and atrocities,
and some of the best American reporters of the time—John
Gunther and Vincent Sheean and Ed Murrow—always
seemed to be on hand. They came to look like heroic agents
of the American people, who were fascinated and repelled at
Jong distance by the violence of Europe and who, I must say,
indulged a good deal of self-righteousness in parroting the
ancient American lament about “old, sick Europe.”

Well, I was saying, the foreign correspondent was in
vogue. And soon Hollywood created a romantic stereotype

of him. First in the Boy Scout version of Joel McCrea in a

trench coat, then in the subtler variation of Bogart, who
acted so tough and seemed as tricky as Goebbels but who—
for all his smoker’s cough and his cynical appraisal of pass-
ing females—was secretly on the side of all good men and
true.

This attractive stereotype was not only larger than life
but luckier than any journalist living or dead. He followed



--- Page 15 ---
Bot TALK ANOUT AMERICA

unerringly in the tracks of dictators and tipped off foreign
ministers marked for Anschluss. He was behind the curtain
when a king signed an instrument of abdication. He knew
the man who shot the prime minister. He decoded the vital
message that gave the date of the invasion. He was always
where the action was.

In life, it is not like that. Only by the wildest freak is
a reporter, after many years on the hop, actually present at ~
a single accidental conyulsion of history. Mostly, we write
the coroner’s inquest, the account of the funeral, the recon-
struction of the prison riot, the trial of the spy, not the hatch-
ing of the plot. :

.On the night of Tuesday, June 4, 1968, for the first time
in thirty years, ] found myself, by one casual chance in a
thousand, on hand: in a narrow serving pantry of the Am-
bassador Hotel in Los Angeles, a place that, I suppose, will
never be wiped out of my memory as a sinister alley, a Roman
circus run amok, and a charnel house. It would be false to
say, as'I should truly like to say, that I am sorry I was there.
It is more complicated than that. Nothing so simple as a
conflict between professional pride and human revulsion, be-
tween having the feelings and having to sit down and write
about them. Yet, because I saw it for once not as an event
to comment on but as a thunderbolt assault on the senses, my
own view of the whole thing, now and later, is bound to be
from the stomach up to the head. Visceral, as we say. I don’t
imagine that if your hand falls on a live wire you are in any
condition to measure the charge or judge the sense of the
public safety regulations or moralize about the electric com-
pany’s dereliction of duty. .

So my view of this miserable episode is probably strange
and I ought not to ascribe to anybody ‘else the shape or color
of the opinions that floated up later from my muddled sensa-

tions. I warn you about this, because I feel unmoved by some
ideas that others feel strongly, and on the other hand I have
some fears that others may not share. So, since this is a more
personal talk that I could have hoped, I had better tell you
how it came about.

On that Tuesday afternoon, I was in San Francisco,

on one of those jewellike days that are revealed when the
wrapping of the morning fog has been lifted. I had no great
urge to fly to the vast spread of Los Angeles. On the contrary,
Lhad hoped to spend the day padding down the fairways of
the Olympic Club, which run like cathedral aisles between
superb stands of cypresses. But it was election day, and Los
Angeles is now the hub of California politics, if only because—
of the fifty-eight coutnies of California—Los Angeles County
alone accounts for 48 per cent of the vote. For the purpose of
an election dateline, San Francisco, four hundred-odd miles
away, was not much better than New York City. So it had
to be done. I was going to have to report the general atmos-
phere of the winner’s camp and the loser’s.
I had seen scores of these election-night entertainments. _

They are amiable but blowsy affairs. But to give me a fresh
view of a ceremony that had staled by familiarity, and also |
‘to make some compensation to a hostess who had offered me .

_ a bed, I had asked her if she would like to mooch around the

., town with me and see what we could see. She was agog with

“anticipation, for just as a foreign correspondent thinks a

s 2 movie actress must have a fascinating life, so a movie actress

‘ thought a correspondent’s life must be glamorous in the ex-

¢ treme. . ,

Oregon result was exactly predicted by the Big Brain twelve
minutes after the polls closed, when the returns already in
were less than-one per cent. Somehow, the Brain was having
more trouble with California. Party politics are, for various
historical reasons, very loosely organized in that state, and,
for one thing, its northern end tends to contradict the verdict
of the south. So when the early returns from the north showed
McCarthy in a commanding lead it proved nothing. Los
Angeles ‘County, with its heavy working-class vote and its
swarms of Negroes (or blacks, as we are now more respect-
fully meant to say), and its Mexican-Americans, was fairly
certain to go heavily for Kennedy. Pretty soon, the gap be-
tween McCarthy’s tally and Kennedy’s began to shrink and
it became clear that, saving a miracle, McCarthy would not _
be able to withstand the avalanche of Los Angeles votes that
began to move in for Kennedy. The computers were silent,
but the writing was on the wall.

Just before eleven, then, we took off for the McCarthy
hotel, and there was no doubt when we got there that the
college boys and the miniskirt girls and the wandering poets
and the spruced-up student leaders and the chin-up McCarthy
staff were whistling in a graveyard. There was a rock band
that whooped it up all the louder to drown out the inevitable
news. They would pause awhile, and another ominous sta-
tistic would be flashed, and an m.c. would shout, “Are we
downhearted?” And the ballroom crowd would roar its de-
fiance of the obvious.

The Ambassador, a comparatively venerable hotel miles
away on Wilshire Boulevard, was the Kennedy headquarters.
And that was the place to be. We took off, and so did lots
of other people, so that when we turned ‘into the long drive-
way we lined up behind scores of cars containing all those
sensible people who love a winner. At last we got into the



--- Page 18 ---
A. BAD NIGUT IN LOS ANGELES 307

hotel lobby and a tumult of singing, cheering, and happy
hobnobbing. Election parties give out innumerable tickets
and badges to keep out the rabble, but no one is more aware
than a winning candidate that on such occasions the rabble
are the people. So you can usually drift with the multitude
and nobody asks for a credential.

It was not so at the Ambassador. Guards and cops
blocked the entrance to the ballroom, and I doubt that a pass-
port and a birth certificate and a personal recommendation
from Senator Kennedy could have got you in. My own general
press credentials were useless. The lobbies were too packed
to lift an elbow and too deafening to talk in. My companion
: and I screamed at each other through the din of all these
happy people and we decided that the whole safari had been.
a mistake. We turned and started down the corridor for the’ _
outdoors and for home. i

On our left, about fifty feet along, was another door
to another room and a pack of people trying and failing to.
get through. There was a guard shaking his head continu.
‘ously and pushing people back and behind him a young
Kennedy staff man turning down everybody. This man
shouted over the bobbing heads, “Mr. Cooke, come on, you
can get in here.” We were folded in through the mob and
emerged, as from a chute, into an open place: a cool, half.
empty room, a small private dining room of the hotel stripped
and fitted out as a press room. There were two newsmen I
knew and a radio man untangling cables, and a swarthy
photographer in a sweatshirt locking up his cameras, and
one or two middle-aged women and a half-dozen Western
Union girls, and a fat girl in a Keniedy,. boater, a young
reporter in a beard, and, I guess, his girl.

It was a perfect private way through to the ballroom. But
"one of my reporter friends said, “You don’t want to get in

there. It’s murder in there. Anyway, Pierre’—Pierre Salinger
—“has promised that when Bobby gets through his speech
he'll come through into this room and talk with us.” It was
an unbelievable break. We sat down and had a drink and
heard the telegraph girls tapping out copy and tried not to
wince at the television set in a corner that was tuned up to
a howling decibel level.

A few minutes later the television commentators gave
way to the ballroom scene, and Bobby was up there with his
beaming helpers and his ecstatic little wife, and he was thank-
ing everybody and saying things must change, and so on to
Chicago. It was about eighteen minutes after midnight. We
were standing outside the swinging doors that gave onto a
serving pantry he would come through on his way from the
ballroom to us. These doors had no glass peepholes, but we'd
soon hear the pleasant bustle of him coming through greeting

_ the colored chef and various waiters and bus boys who had
_lined up to shake his hand.

_ Then. Above the bassy boom of the television there was
a banging repetition of sounds. Like somebody dropping a
rack of trays, or banging a single tray against a wall. Half
a dozen of us were startled enough to head for the swinging
doors, and suddenly we were jolted through by a flying wedge
of other men. It had just happened. It was a narrow lane he
had to come through, for there were two long steam tables
and somebody had stacked up against them those trellis
gates, with artificial leaves stuck on them, that they use to
fence a dance band off from the floor. The only light was the
blue-white light of three fluorescent tubes slotted in the ceil- |
ing. ;
We heard nothing but a howling jungle of cries and
obscenities and saw a turmoil of arms and fearful faces and
flying limbs, and two enormous backs—of Roosevelt Grier,

the football player, and Rafer Johnson, the Olympic cham-
pion—piling onto a pair of blue jeans on a steam table. There
was a head on the floor streaming blood, and somebody put |
a Kennedy boater under it,-and the blood trickled down the
sides like chocolate sauce on an iced cake. There were spl ashes
of flash bulbs, and infernal heat, and the button eyes of Ethel
Kennedy turned to cinders. She was wrestling or slapping a”
young man and he was saying, “Listen, lady, I’m hurt, too.”
And then she was on her knees cradling him briefly, and in
_another little pool of light on the greasy floor was a huddle
of clothes and staring out of it the face of Bobby Kennedy,
like the stone face of a child’s effigy on a cathedral tomb.

I had, and have, no idea of the stretch of time, or any
immediate sense of the event itself. Everybody has a vulner-
able organ that reacts to shock, and mine is the stomach. My
lips were like emery paper and I was feeling very sick and
hollow. I pattered back into the creamy-green genteel dining ©
room. And only then did I hear somebody yell, “Kennedy's
shot, they shot him.” I heard a girl nearby moan, “No, no,
not again!” And while I was thinking, “That was in Dallas,”
a dark woman suddenly bounded to a table and beat it and
howled like a wolf, “Goddam stinking country! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!” Another woman attacked the bright tele-
vision screen and the image of the placid commentators, who
had not yet got the news. My companion was fingering a
cigarette package like a paralytic. I sat her down and went
back in again. Everybody wanted to make space and air,
but everybody also wanted to see the worst. By now, the
baying and the moaning had carried over into the ballroom,
and it sounded like a great hospital bombed and in panic.

, It may have been a minute or twenty minutes later when
a squad of cops bristling with shotguns burst toward us
through the swinging doors of the pantry with their bundle

of the black curly head and the jeans, and the tight, small
behind, and the limp head, and a face totally dazed.

Well, the next morning, when I saw and heard the
Pope in his gentle, faltering English, I still could not believe
that he was talking about the squalid, appalling scene in a
hotel pantry that I had been a part of and would always be
a part of.

I don’t doubt that such ‘an experience is a trauma. And
because of it, and five days later, I still cannot rise to the
‘editorial pages and the general lamentations about a‘ sick
society. I for one do not feel like an accessory to a crime.
And I reject, almost as a frivolous obscenity, the notion of
collective guilt, the idea that I or the American pcople killed
John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Martin Luther King and Robert
Francis Kennedy. I don’t believe, either, that you conceived
Hitler, and that in some deep unfathomable sense all Europe
was responsible for the extermination of six million Jews.
With Edmund Burke, I don’t know how you can indict a
whole nation, To me, this now roaringly fashionable theme
is a great folly. It is difficult to resist, because it provides ©
emergency resuscitation to one’s ’self-esteem. It deflects the

. search for a villain to some big corporate culprit. It offers
cheap reassurance, cut-rate wisdom, but is really a way of
opting out of the human situation: a situation that includes
pity for the dead Kennedys and the living, compassion for
Sirhan Sirhan, and sympathy for the American nation at a
time when the vicious side of its frontier tradition—to which
it has owed its vigor and variety—is surging up again, for
reasons that no one has accurately diagnosed. ;

I said as much as this to a young friend. And he replied,

A “Me too. I don't feel implicated in the murder of John or

Mos sty Ww But when Martin Luther King is killed, the

It is a tremendous sentence and exposes the present
‘danger to America and its public order. The more people
‘talk about collective guilt, the more they will feel it. For
‘after three hundred years of subjection and lively prejudice,
any desperate black man or deluded outcast is likely to act
as if it were true: that the American people, and not their-
iderelicts, are the villains, . “

‘_-? AT MIDNIGHT on June 4 a score or so of newspaper men were in a room adjoining

: the hoiel pantry through which Senator Kennedy was going to talk to them after his-

;. _ Victory speech in the ballroom of the Hotel Ambassador, Los Angeles. ALISTAIR
wpe d COOKE was among them. Here is his account of the seene ; :

An hour or so before mid-
night, it was already clear that
a wake was setting in at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel, where
_the youngsters for McCarthy
roamed in great numbers in
and around the~ grand ball-
room. | a te
5 The percentage gap between
-McCarthy’s lead over Kennedy
\ was shrinking: every quarter
: ‘hour or so, as the returns from
. Los Angeles County began to
overtake McCarthy’s anticipated
strength in Northern California. .
‘It was a young and doughty
a! crowd gamely but ‘hopelessly
~ trying to, keep its spirit up.
, In this country, at any rate,
only the very pure in heart love
a loser. And it seemed a good
idea to move of to the victory
boy at the Ambassador. Wilshire
Boulevard is ene of the earliest’
of the long straight avenues that
bisect the huge east-west spread
of this city, and at such a time
» « .it seemed as long as a Roman
. road, The hotel’s driveway was
a miniature freeway in-a traffic
jam, and-the human traffic inside
the foyer was almost worse,
Glare of light --

strutting caps and guards and

The place was no longer than
about 40 feet. It was a small
private dining room, fitted out as
a press room, There was a long
trestle table against one_ wall
Joaded with typewriters and tele-
phones; and standing by were a
few middle-aged lady opcratois
taking a breather. :

. In one corner was-a booming
television set switching between
the rumblings of defeat at the
McCarthy hotel and the clamour
of victory in the adjacent ball--

,room, A fat girl wearing a
Kennedy straw hat sucked a coke
through a ‘straw. There were
15 or 20 of us at most, exchang-
ing campaign reminiscences and
making the usual hindsight
cracks at the Kennedys.

Pierre Salinger, | Kennedy's
press secretary, had promised

*- coming

that once the Senator had’
saluted his army he- would .go

down from the ballroom stage

and come to see us through the
kitchen, that separated our
retreat from the ballroom. |.

It was just after. thidnight. A
surge of cheers and a_ great
swivelling of lights heralded him,
and soon he was up on the
rostrum with his eager, button-
eyed wife and Jesse Unruh, his
massive campaign manager. It
took minutes to get the feedback
boom out of the mikes but at
last there was a kind of sub-
dued uproar and he said he first’
wanted to’ express “my high
“regard to Don Drysdale for’ his
six great shut-outs.” (Drysdale is
a baseball pitcher whose Tuesday

night feat of holding his sixth~

successive opposing teams to no

runs had made him a legend.)
It was the right, the wry Ken-

nedy note. He thanked a list of

helpers by. name. .He thanked-

“all those loyal Mexican Ameri-

_ cans” and “all my friends in the

black community.” Then. he
stiffened his gestures. and his
style and. said it only went to
show that “all those promises
and all those party caucuses have
indicated that the people of the
United States want a change.”
He congratulated McCarthy on
fighting for his principles. He
hoped that now there might be
“a debate between’ the Vice-
President and perhaps myself.”

chuckling,: rabbity smile « and
ended, “My thanks to all of you

and the high rwoaning cries of

WILLIAM J. COX, 3974 West Ingraham, was interviewed
at his residence and furnished the following information:

He was a volunteer for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
and at 7:30 PM on June 4, 1968, he went to the Ambassador
Hotel to await the results of the California primary election.
On arrival at the Ambassador Hotel, he went immediately to the
Embassy Room and remained there the entire evening.

He was in the Embassy Room at the time of Senator
KENNEDY's victory speech and shortly after KENNEDY left the
podium he heard several loud bangs which he assumed were
breaking balloons. There was a great deal of shouting and
pushing by the crowd, but at first he assumed this was just
part of the victory celebration. As he was attempting to
leave the Embassy Room, ANN FERGUSON asked him to help ERWIN
STROLL because STROLL had been shot in the leg. At first he

thought FERGUSON was joking, but then he saw STROLL's leg had
blood on it.

He, along with DAVID ESQUITH and another white male,
unknown to him, helped carry STROLL from the Embassy Room to
the entrance of the Ambassador Hotel where they placed him in
a taxicab. DAVID ESQUITH accompanied STROLL to the Central

Receiving Hospital while he attempted to return to the Embassy
Room.

While attempting to reenter the Embassy Room, he
met Mrs. TIFFANY JONAS and ANN FERGUSON. Mrs. JONAS suggested
that they go to the Central Receiving Hospital and stay with
ERWIN STROLL until STROLL's parents could be contacted. All
three of them then went to the Central Receiving Hospital in
ANN FERGUSON's car and waited for the arrival of STROLL's
parents. After STROLL's parents arrived at the receiving
hospital, he and ANN FERGUSON returned to the Ambassador Hotel
for a few minutes and then went home.

course of conversation with a woman,whose first name was INGER,
last name unrecalled, he had been advised that she, INGER,
had observed SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN standing in the crowd during
Senator KENNEDY's victory speech. COX stated that INGER had

as fireman with the Newark, New Jersey, Fire Department.
He is now employed for the Gordon Bread Company on Santa

CRITCHEIEY stated that on the evening of June 4,
1968, he was with several other young men who live at this
boarding house wat:ching television coverage of the primary
election results. He became aware that the KENNEDY
campaign headquarters was located in the Ambassador Hotel
located only one half block from his boarding house. Out
of curiosity, he agreed to accompany PAUL GRIECO who was
present with him then to the Ambassador in an effort to
try to see Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY and possibly shake his
hand. At about 10:45 p.m., he and GRIECO walked to the
Ambassador but were turned away from entering the Embassy
Room where KENNEDY was to appear. A fire warden advised
them that this room already contained the maximum number of
persons allowed. He and GRIECO then proceeded to another
room in this hotel and mingled among the supporters of
candidate RAFFERTY. At about 11:45 p.m., he and GRIECO
came back to the main lobby of the Ambassador and learned
from people standing in the lobby that Senator KENNEDY was
about to make a speech in the Embassy Room and would depart
after the speech through the kitchen area behind the Embassy
Room. He and GRIECO then found a corridor and went to the
kitchen area. They both stood in a group of people on each
side of an exit behind the Embassy Room and the kitchen,
where they were told by “KENNEDY girls" that Senator KENNEDY
would pass after finishing his speech.

After KENNEDY had completed his speech, he
appeared in the kitchen area surrounded by several of his
aides. There was a sizable group of people there to shake
KENNEDY's hand, between 50 and 75. In the rush of persons
to get to KENNEDY, CRITCHELEY found himself pushed through
a smali door in an adjourning area after KENNEDY had passed.
CRITCHELEY recalled hearing sounds Like the popping of
palloons but did not realize they were pistol shots. He
said he was not close enough: to KENNEDY to observe him at
this time. There was an immediate rush of panic stricken
people backed up upon him, during which time, it was all he
could do to maintain his footing. Through the screaming
and pandemonium which existed, he became aware that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot. After the panic subsided, he went to
the area where KENNEDY was lying on the floor and then was
instructed by some man, seemingly with authority, to help
keep curious bystanders out of the kitchen area. He therefore
stood at the door leading from the corridor to the main
lobby and held people back.

He remained in the area of the kitchen until
KENNEDY was removed by police attendants and then he went
to a small room in an adjourning area and was interviewed
by police detectives and admitted to them that he was present
put did not see the shooting.

CRITCHELEY said he did not see SIRHAN before the
shooting nor did he see him after the shooting.

furnished the following information:

She was a volunteer for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
and on June 4, 1968, she went to the Ambassador Hotel, to
await the results of the California primary election. DAVID
ESQUITH picked her and her mother up at approximately 6:30 pm
and they went to the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel,
where they met ERWIN STROLL. At about 10:15 pm, JIM LOWE
asked STROLL to watch the entrance to the kitchen, which was
next to the podium.

At about midnight, Senator KENNEDY came to the
podium to give his victory speech. At this point, Miss
CUCCIA's mother became ill because of the stuffiness of the
Embassy Room, and it was necessary for her to leave the
hotel. Miss CUCCIA accompanied her mother to the elevator
outside of the Embassy Room. After getting her mother on
the elevator, Miss CUCCIA went to the Ballroom where she met
TIFFANY JONAS. After meeting Mrs. JONAS, they both attempted
to return to the Embassy Room, but were stopped in the area
of the press room by the security guard. Just after arriving
at the door to the press room, she heard a pop, which sounded
like a bag was being broken. . Immediately after the pop, there
was a great deal of pushing and shouting. Some members of the
press attempted to get into the press room and there was
altercation between the security guard and one of the press men.
As this is going on, a woman passed by who said that Senator
KENNEDY has been shot.

At this point, she observed ERWIN STROLL being
helped from the Embassy Room by three men and realized that
he had been shot. Upon realizing that STROLL had been shot,
she became very emotional and it was necessary for STEVE
WAGNER to bring her home. Prior to leaving the Ambassador
Hotel with WAGNER, she did observe SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
being taken from the hotel by the police.

JAMES CUMMINGS, residence 1700 Burnside Street, Los
Angeles, California, was interviewed at his place of employment,
Falk General Laboratories, 3450 West First Street, Los Angeles,
California, telephone 383-0663. CUMMINGS advised he left his
office at about 11:30 p.m. om June 4, 1968 en route to the Am-
bassador Hotel to join the ROBERT F, KENNEDY Campaign Party.
After arriving at the hotel, he walked to the Embassy Room,
arriving there shortly before KENNEDY began his acceptance
speech. During the speech he entered the hallway which connects
the Embassy Room podium to the Embassy Room service pantry and
remained there until KENNEDY finished his speech.

CUMMINGS stated he stood in the hallway as KENNEDY
surrounded by several members of the campaign party walked
through the hallway and to the Embassy Room service pantry.

fter observing KENNEDY enter the pantry, he turned towards
the opposite end of the hallway at which “time he heard three gun
shots with about a one second interval between each shot and
then a series of shotss howevery he did not recall how many
shots all together were fired.

CUMMINGS stated after the shots were fired crowds
of people converged into the pantry from the Embassy Room and
the hallway at the opposite end of the pantry. Due to the
commotion that ensued after the shooting, CUMMINGS was unable
to observe the individual who shot KENNEDY or furnish any

bo New York, New York. He stated that he is employed as a
: Staff Photographer for Life Magazine and that le resides at
333 East 46th Street, New York, New York.

Approximately one week after Senator ROBERT
KENNEDY instituted his campaign to seek the Democratic
Party Presidential nomination, EPPRIDGE joined the campaign
'as the Life Magazine photographer and was acting in such
capacity on June 4 - 5, 1968 in Los Angeles, California.

, On the evening of June 4, 1968, at the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles on his way to the balircom to make a
victory spsech, Senatox KENNEDY took a service elevator.
Shortly after getting off the elevator, Senator KENNEDY
got out of line and went into the kitchen of the hotel and
shook hands with some of the employees in the kitchen.
Senator KENNEDY then got back in line and proceeded along
a corridor. At this point, EPPRIDGE was three o¥ four people
in back of Senator KENNEDY and a heavy set girl, white, about
5 feet 4 inches or 5 feet 5 inches, in her early 20's with a.
swarthy complexion, hefty build, olive, darkish or tan
complexion, who seemed te be alone and who. was wearing
something polka dottish, maybe a kerchief or some such thing
in possibly black and red colars, tried to get in line next
to EPPRIDGR. (EPPRIDGE cannot remember her face as he just
caught a glance of her.) EPPRIDGE did not think that she
belonsed there and he gave her a poke in the ribs to get her
out of the way. She persisted in her attempts to get in line
and EPPRIDGE gave her another poke. .

At this point, EPPRIDGES started to go up the steps
to the platform. . oo
During Senitor KENMEDY's speech, EPPRIDGE was just
behind him and to the side. EPPRIDGE did not see this girl
while he was con the platforn. : : :

On the platform, there was a very large crowd,
the largest in the campaign and there was much .shoving
from behind and eae eae! sn was so great that EPPRIDGE
could just barely g t his arms above his head.

. Immediately prior to Senator KENNEDY ending
his speech, someone opened a path to Senator KENNEDY's
right, off the platform, in what was apparently a route
of exit for Senator KENNEDY. BILL BARRY, a member of
Senator KENNEDY's staff was to the right and apparently
