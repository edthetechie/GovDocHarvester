Miss Mary. Ellmann.
12 st.- Ronan Terrace ~
New Haven, Connecticut 06511 |

. Dear Miss BLimann,

.. hie wil acknowledge receipt of your
letter of Mareh 13.

The Sixhan trial in-Los Angeles is conducted

_under the authority of the State of California. More=

over, the regulation of the conduct of attorneys~at- .
law is a state matter. The questions which you raise .
in your letter. are not matters with which federal
officers have any direct concern.

In a federal system: of government, there is
necessarily an allocation of function and responsibility
between the states on the one hand, and the federal -
government on the other. Although these two agencies
should function cooperatively, it is most appropriate
that one should not undertake to interfere in an area
which is the responsibility of another. .

I am glad to have your statement of concern,
and appreciate your sending it to me,

very truly yours,

Erwin N. Griswold
Solicitor General

Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold
Justice Department
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I would like to express concern for the
validity of Sirhan Sirhan's defense, in view
of his lawyers' arrangement to share profits
of Robert B. Kaiser's proposed book on Sirhan.

This profit seems different from, and improper
in comparison to, the acceptance by lawyers of
set, regular fees. Such an agreement as this
literary one taints the present defense with

a financial interest in the popular, and even
sensational, qualities of the case, and so
involves potential injustice to the defendant.
For example, might the manuscript of Kaiser's
book bring more money to these lawyers if
Sirhan behaves wildly, rather than calmly, in
court? Might the manuscript bring more money
to these lawyers if Sirhan is sentenced to
death rather than to life imprisonment?

This is a case in which Americans are anxious

to see the most fastidious justice done. Yet,
we have already witnessed what seems flagrant
gabbling about the case outside the courtroom,
on the part of district attornies, and now
defense attornies appear to be shabbibly engaged
in profiting from the eventual sale of the case
to the public.

Sincerely yours,

Maw Ellusrann

Dear Congresaman Belcher:

This is in reply to your mesorandws enclosing
a copy of a letter from Mrs. Helen Willians dealing,
in part, with the Sharon Tate frial in California
and Sirhan Sirhan, Please excuse ay delay in responding.

Each of these cases was tried in California
State Courts for offenses against the State of Califor-
nia. Since no federal offense wag involved in either .
matter this Department had no authority or control
over the length of the trials. I vaderstand that in
the Sharon Tate case, proceedings are now under way to
determine the penalty or penalties to be and
that in the Sirhan matter, a0 appeal is pendiug im the
California Courts. If Mrs. Williams desires further
_ information, she may wish to write the Attorney Geeeral
of California.

An arrest report of the Sierra Madre Police Depart-
ment dated September 23, 1970, shows that Saidallah Bishara
Sirhan, brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, had been arrested
on September 23, 1970, by the Sierra Madre Police Department,
in charges of suspicion of possession of marijuana.

Arrest report of the Sierra Madre Police Department
dated September 23, 1970, shows that Saidallah Bishara Sirhan
was arrested at Lime and Sierra Madre Boulevard and charged
with violations of Sections 11530 (Possession of Marijuana),
and 13910 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) of the California
Health and Safety Code. The address of Saidallah Sirhan was
listed in this report as 1659 North Lake, Number seven, Pas-
adena, California,

According to the arrest report Saidallah Sirhan
and two other suspects were in a vehicle when an attempt was
made by a Sierra Madre police officer to stop the vehicle for
a traffic violation. While attempting to stop the vehicle,
a plastic bag containing a green leafy substance resembling
marijuana, was thrown from the vehicle. During the inventory.
of Saidallah Sirhan's property additional contraband was
found,

. According to the erime report of this incident, the
arresting officer observed a vehicle driven by Saidallah Sir-
han on which the license plate light was inoperative. The
vehicle was being driven erratically and while attempting to
halt the vehicle, the arresting officer observed a plastic
bag expelled from the left front window of the car. This was
later retrieved and found to contain a green leafy substance
resembling marijuana,

The three suspects were arrested and transported
to the Sierra Madre Police Department for booking. While
removing personal belongings from Saidallah Sirhan a tin
foil wrapper containing five blue-green capsules of a white
powdery substance were observed to fall from his folded up
shirt sleeve.

Saidallah Sirhan was arraigned on September 23,
1970, in Division Two, Pasadena Municipal Court. A prelim-
inary hearing was set for October 2, 1970, in Division One
of the same court.

On October 2, 1970, the case against Saidallah
Sirhan was dismissed as there was insufficient information
to link the defendant with the evidence.

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

This is in reply to your inquiry received January 25, 1971,
captioned "Freedom of Information Act," which coucerns a request by
one Michael James Clark for access to certain reports regarding
Sirhan B. Sirhan. In his letter to the Department, Clark bases his request
on the fact that he alleges FBI reports had been made available to
Robert Blair Kaiser, the author of the recently published book, "RFK
Must Die. ”

AS was indicated in my letter of November 18, 1970,
captioned as above, FBI reports were furnished the Loe Angeles County,
California, District Attorney's Office with the request they not be

outside that office. Neither the FBI nor the Los Angeles
County District Attorney's Office furnished copies of FBI reports to the
defense. :

: Defense counsel through the court demanded production of
the Los Angeles, California, Police Department and FBI interviews of
pertinent individuals in connection with the investigation. Review of
these interviews was made by the prosecution and copies of requested
interviews made. This material was then taken to the court and, upon
proper order, turned over to the defense by the court. No restrictions
were imposed concerning the use which could be made of this material.

This Bureau did not make copies of FBI reports available
to Robert Blair Kaiser. Accordingly, it is recommended Clark's request
be denied since the information requested by him is contained in
investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.

A LETTER OF CONCERN

Mr. President:

Before I start with what I am concerned, I think, it only
fitting that you should know something about me. I ama
graduate student at Central Michigan University. I am not studying
political science, but I am concerned about some issues which
I hope you can clear up for me.

1. Many persons involved in war crimes in Viet Nam have

©@ been brought to trail recently. Their trials are
prompt and right to the point. Besides this everyone
in our country and aboard are given the details of the
trials. Now, I want to know why a man like Sirhan-
Sirhan has not come to trial yet. His crime was one
which caused much misery to many people and caused
this country to lose a young leader. In my eyes this
was an outright crime against the government of the
United States, Where is his trial? I am sure if one
of our people in some foreign country was caught in
act he would not even receive a trial!

‘

2, Iam a person with great love and admerat ten for "i720

® country and what it stands for(All men created equal)!



--- Page 31 ---
nn di ae

~~

If I were to be drafted tomorrow I would sladly go

to serve my country because of my love for it, but

I will never let myself be drafted until a person

like Cassius Clay serves his time, too. If I can

take a chance of dying to make this a better world for
him, he can do the same for me. Besides, he does not
even have any real dependants and I do. Like we

say, "All men are created equal!", weather they are
black or white, All we are doing is going from one
extreme to the other and I know, as you do, of many
people of importance, greater than his, who have served
their country. Also, if he.ts a minister, he had

the shortest lesson in it that I have ever heard of.

These are only tivo of many questions I have, but I

have already taken up too much of your valuable time. Please

find a little time for my questions, because they are of great

importance to me.

Thank you for your time.

A fellow American,

Mr, William A. Morren

Department of Justice

firs;

I am a citizen of this great nation, the United States of America,
I believe in it and all of its principals, especially in its justice
for all. I know that justice is sometimes abused and misused,
even here in the United States, especially in such issues as; Viet
Nam, the death of our late president John F, Kennedy, and his brother
Robert F, Kennedy; where public opinion expressed in print or in
public demonstration or otherwise is used as a weapon by those who
would shape justice to fit their own mold. In the past decade, many
defense lawyers have used public opinion unjustly. They say that
because of strong public opinion their client cannot gei a fair
trial. You can't throw the case out just because of this. If there
is undeniable evidence that the defendent is guilty, he must pay for

his crime.

I am talking specifically about one case; the case of "THE PEOPLE
VS <IRHAN SIRHAN". He is, as you know, accused of the slaying of

Robert F, Kennedy. Thus far, there is no dispute of his alleged guilt.

‘Lot. Saw /
I think that it is every citizen's right to kn i $8 what is going on.

in this case. !

firhan killed, not just a public figure, but a great humanitarian
who could possibly have done the people of this nation a great
service, had he been given the chance. This makes it the right of
every citizen to know just what is being done to justify such an
act of violence. Come people believe that firhan's father's threat
of an uprise in the Arab people has scared the United ftates, but
I don't believe this. I have more faith in my country than that,
But, I would like to know what is happening to bring forth justice,

and why everything about the case has been hushed up so.

Please forgive me if I seem anxious to hang aman, I'm not,
I just don't like the thought of this incident reoccurring, because
someone thinks that he can get away with it because the last guy did.
I just want to see justice done. That prbably sounds old and corny,
but it's the truth. It used to be said that justice was for those
who could afford it. I think it's about time we put justice back
where it belongs; where our Forefathers meant it to be when they

founded our nation: a nation with "Liberty and JUSTICE FOR ALL."!

Peter Nordberg,

a 4129 North Farwell,
Shorewood, Wisconsin,
November 10, 1969

The President,

The White House,

Washington D.C.

Mr. President :

I have previously written several letters abundant in
criticism of your administration's policies, This is not
a letter of condemnation, but a plea for mercy.

Mercy for one Sirhan Sirhan, who was found guilty of
first degree murder in California, a state where murder
is punishable by death.

Sirhan killed a great man, but I do not think that
the murder of any person will be set right by the murder of
another.

Had Sirhan killed either you or Senator Eugene McCarthy
while you were campaigning here, the most he could have
gotten would have been life imprisonment. But for some
reason, unknown to me, government has decided that assassination
is more of a crime in California then it is here.

Put yourself in Sirhan's place; a person who might very
well become the next president of this country supports your
enemy in a war against you, What choice have you? Since
you are a little mentally unbalanced to begin with, what choice
have you? Ther is murder, And that is all.

Sirhan is a patriot. Patriotic to his own country, not ours,
Are we to condemn a man to die because hd is perhaps slightly
chauvinistic?

I know that, with your power, you can stay Sirhan's death
sentence, making it life imprisonment, instead. An even better
idea would be to turn him over to the Jordanians, but I rather
imagine that that idea sounds rather unappealing to you. Il
understand. I know that rage I felt, and the sorrow, when I
first heard that Robert Kennedy had been shot,

Ronald Reagan will not issue a reprieve, Ronald Reagan
is a reactionary, however, and you are not. There is a greater

chance that you will understand my plea.
Bre ae. Y,

Thank you,

SONNY SEELBACH, 1306 Holmden Ave. — “In the
Boston game, June 14, Rocky Colavito hit a home run with
the bases full, his seventh with the bases full, a record.
The guard gave the ball I caught to Rocky Colavito and
the guard gave me a new baseball.”

(Congratulations to you, the guard and Rocky ...

Dept. of Justice
Washington D.C.

Dear Sir(s)

It has come to my attention that the-murderer of Robert F.
Kennedy is still living. In the midst of scores of people
one Mr. Sirhan Sirhan committed cold-blooded murder, May I
ask why it is so hard to convict and execute such filthy
vermine. You may think I am some kind of radical person
bent on seeing people die. It so happens that I am merely
a 14 year old boy that is interested in seeing justice pre-

vail.
