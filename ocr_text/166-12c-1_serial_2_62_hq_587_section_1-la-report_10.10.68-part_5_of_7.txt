MARGARET SCOTT, 14341 Haywood, telephonically
advised that she was formerly employed at the Lucky
Discount. Store, 433 East Villa Street, Pasadena, California,
in the Jewelry Department. She explained that the Jewelry
Department also had a film processing service and that
SIRHAN SIRHAN was a steady customer. She stated that he
spent an average of $10.00 to $12.00 a week on films and
processing and owned a very expensive camera.

Mrs. SCOTT stated that SIRHAN SIRHAN was particularly
noticed by her and some of the other employees of the
Jewelry Department, because of his personality... She stated
that he would be very indignant if his films were not ready
or if there was any problem with the way they were processed.
She continued that they had a part-time employee at the
Jewelry Department named SERGE ETIENNE who was a student at
Pasadena City College. She stated that SIRHAN SIRHAN was
friendly with SERGE, and when he came in for his films, he
would talk with SERGE. She stated that she did not know
where SERGE resided but assumed he lived locally in the
Pasadena area.

Mrs. SCOTT stated that she was furnishing this
information to the FBI because she felt there was a
possibility that some of SIRHAN's film may still be at the
store and had not been picked up by hin.

It was previously reported that when interviewed on
June 16, 1968, LARRY KENNETH ARNOT, Salesman for the Lock,
Stock 'N Barrel Gun Shop, had advised that an individual,
who he identified as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, purchased ammunition
at the gun shop on June 1, 1968. At that time SIRHAN was
reportedly accompanied by two other individuals, one resembling
SHARIF SIRHAN, :

A polygraph examination was afforded ARNOT on
August 5, 1968, at the Scientific Investigation Division,

A copy of the results of this polygraph examination was

FROM: Lt. E. Hernandez, Investigator Background Conspiracy Team
SUBJECT: Polygraph Examination of Mr. Larry Arnot

On August 5, 1968 a polygraph examination was administered to Mr.”

Larry Arnot, 517 Melcanyon Rd., Duarte, California, Ph#358-8787.

The examination was administered by Lt. Hernandez in the polygraph
facilities of Sclantifie Investigation Division Room 432A, Parker
Center. ee a, ”

The purpose of this examination was to determine the truthfulness

Jin Mr. Arnot's statements given to the F.B.I. on June 16, 1968,
“When he informed them that he had sold (4) four boxes of ammunition

to suspect Sirhan Sirhan and two other dark foreign~looking Males
who were present with Sirhan'‘at the.time of the ammunition purchase
on dune 1, 1968. . : .

On that day, June 16, 1363, F.B.I. Agents Bruce Bradford and Norbert
Linker showed Arnot (5) five photogzaphs of Sirhan and his (4) four
brothers, Arnot identified Sirhan as being the person that purchased
the ammmition, and also selected a photograph of Shariff Sirhan,

as “Bearing a strong resemblance to the individual that was present
with himn.® Axnot said that he would be unable to identify the third
person that was present in the store on that day.

Prior to instrumental testing on the polygraph, Arnot was questioned
regarding the statement given by him to the F.2.I. on June 16, 1968.
He maintained that his original story as given to the F.5.1. was
true to the best of his recollection.

Arnot was shown a total of 17 look-alike photographs by Lt. Hernandez.
These included four of the Sirhan brothers. Arnot looked over each |
of these photographs carefully and selected the following three photo-

- graphs:

-°(1)° Photograph c£ Munir Sirhan”
(2) Photograph of look~alike - Bk No. 63481-1965
(3) Photograph of another look-alike ~ Bk No. 102661~1366

After selecting Munir Sirhan's photograph, Arnot commented that he
felt he had been brain-washea because he had observed Munir's photo-
graph on a number of previous occasions and therefore he felt taat
nis was influencing his opinion. As to the other two look-alike

. 7 . rate

ae

photographs thet he selected, Arnot stated that he believed he
remembered the two people depicted on the photographs as being
present with Sirhan on June 1, but was not positive.

The instrument and its functions were discussed with Mr. Arnot,
ag were the theory and procedures of the polygraph examination.
He was given an opportunity to ask questions concerning any phase
of the examination. The questions which were to be asked instru-
mentally were reviewed with Mr. Arnot before any instrumental
testing began. , ae

A polygraph was obtained prior to the examination, which estab-
lished that patterns capable of interpretation could be obtained.
Responses wara provoked. This indicated that Hr.. Arnot would be
@ proper subject for polygraph testing.

During the course of the examination, physiological tracings at
points where crucial questions were asked suggest very strongly
“that Mr. Arnot was being untruthful. He was specifically asked

if he honestly remewbered seeing any person with Sixhan inside

the Lock, Steck N' Barrel Gun Shop on June 1, 1968, and his
responses at thig salient point indicate that he does not remember
seeing anyone with Sirhan on that day. Further, after carefully
evaluating the examination charts, it is the opinion of this examiner
that Larry Arnot does not in fact remember. Sirhan or the buginess
transaction that took place on June:1, 1968 when the ammunition was
purchased by Sirhan.

Larry Arnot was informed of the results of the examination and the
conclusions that were arrived. - a

After a short period of interrogation, Arnot ultimately admitted
that the only logical explanation for his failing the test was
because he had lied.

He explained that the truth was that he was confusing the sale of
ammunition to three other dark complextion men, and in his mind

he was trying to convince himself that this was the Sirhan incidest.
However, he said that he couldyytruthfully remember Sirhan being in
the store on Juneil. He knows that he sold Sirhan the ammunition
because of a sales receipt which he made out, but he just cannot
rerrember Sirhan or the sale. _

As to::the two men that he had dascribed as being with Sirhan, he
stated that he had probably been mislead by Mrs. Donna Harrick.

- She had told him that Sirhan and two other men had been in the store
on a day previous te June 1. ‘Therefore, he had assumed that these
two men could have been with Sirhan on June l.

Again Arnot was reminded that he-had ne-sound basis to form this
assumption, and he admitted that he did not.

Arnot requested that the previous reports as given to the F,23.I.
be corrected. (Statements of Larry Arnot in file 8.U.S Tape #29325)

Mrs. Hexrick was administered a polygraph examination on August 6,

1968 at the Polygraph Facilities of Scientific Investigation Division,

Mrs. Herrick informed that she was the wife of Benjamin J. Herrick
and that they owned the Lock, Stock N' Barrel Gun Shop at 8372 East

-Hungtington Drive, San Gabriel, Calif,

The purpose of this examination was to determine if Donna Herrick .
had been truthful to agents of the F.8.I. when she told them that
on or about April 3, 1968 she had observed Sirhan Sirhan in company —
of two Males of ‘foreign decant at her place of business.

. On that day, June 16, 1968, she informed: the F.B.I. that she was

positive Sirhan had attempted to purchase some 357 Magnum Tank
Piercing ammunition, and she selected photegrapns of Adel and Munix
Sirhan as bearing a strong resemblance to the men that were with
Sirhan. Further, Werrick stated that she remembered Sirhan nad

such a heavy accent that she was unable to understand him. In fact,
she asked her husband for assistance to help interpret what Sirhan
was saying.

During the pre-test interview, Donna Herrick was questioned regarding
the statement she had given to the F.8.I. on June 16, 1968, and she
maintained that the statement-was true.

Additional questions were asked relative to the date that she observed

Sixhan (on or about April 3, 1968). She then modified her statenent,
and then changed it again ultinately- saying that Sirhan could have
been in the store during the week of March 27 or during the week of
April 10, 1968. However,! she definitely remembered Sirhan having a
very heavy accent. . .

when Mrs. Herrick was informed that as a matter of fact, suspect
“Sirhan speaks English very well and has no trace of any accent wnat

so ever, Mrs. Herrick stated “Well, maybe he was mumbling.“

At this. point of the pre-test interview, Mrs. Herrick was asked if
she would voluntarily submit to a polygraph examination, she considers
for a few moments and then agreed to take the test.

The instrument and its functions were discussed with Mrs. Herrick
and she was explained the theory and the procedures that would be
followed during the course of the examination.

Prior to instrumental testing, @ polygramsiwas obtained to determine
whether she was a proper subject and capable of producing patterns

adequate for interpretation. Responses were provoked, which indic-
ated that HES » Herrick was a proper subject.

During the. course of the exa mination, physiological tzacings at
points where crucial key questions were asked, indicate quite
strongly that Mrs. Herrick was being untruthful.

After the initial tests, two additional series of questions were
asked and each of these contained questions relative to four key
‘desues which had been praviously asked and to which Mra. Herrick
had responded strongly with indications of deception.

(1) Was there anything that Mrs. Herrick had told the poly-
gzaph exaninor about Sirhan that was not true?

(2) pid Mrs. Herrick honestly remember ever seeing Sirhan
inside her store in person? :
. (3) Did Sixhan ever try to buy | ammunition from Mrs. Herrick
in person?

(4) Did Hrs. Hexrick honestly believa that the person she
had told the examinor about was not Sirhan?

Upon conclusion ef the polygraph examination, Mrs, Herrick was
informed that her responses clearly indicated that she was either
mistaken or that she was deliberately being untruthful, but that
she could not honestly say that she remembered seeing Sirhan oz
talking te him in person. Further, she was informed that her
answers to the above questions were clearly indicative of deception.
To this, Hrs. Herrick stated that she admitted she was confused, but
she did belisve Sixhnan had bean at her store, and again she was
infoxmed that the results of the polygraph examination did not show

SCHAPIRO said that he had taken many pictures
while traveling with the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign
party. He remembers these photographs had been furnished
to the KENNEDY family. He marketed others through the
Black Star Distributing Company.

SCHAPIRO, following the examination of the
photograph obtained July 31, 1968, from HUGH J. MC DONALD,
Assistant Press Secretary to the late Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY, said it looked like one that he had taken. He
said the photograph was taken at the Los Angeles International
Airport sometime in March of 1968, shortly after Senator
KENNEDY announced that he would run for the office of the
President. KENNEDY was on a campaign tour which carried
him to Kansas and then to California. He had chartered
a plane and had gone to San Francisco and on the return
trip to Los Angeles, they stopped at several cities in
Central California. Upon arrival at the Los Angeles
International Airport about midday or early afternoon, a
large crowd, larger than expected, had gathered and as
KENNEDY was walking through a narrow passageway leading
into the main area of the terminal, the photograph was taken.
SCHAPIRO could not recall the name of the airline chartered
or the name of the terminal. KENNEDY normally chartered
flights through American Airlines. The only person
besides KENNEDY recognized by SCHAPIRO was WILLIAM
BARRY, a KENNEDY aide. He was standing beside KENNEDY.

The two youths were not associated with any organized group.
In fact, if any organized group had been present, SCHAPIRO
had no knowledge of it. The youth in the picture in question

WILLIAM Je WILSON, General Truck Sales, 535
Murfreesboro Road, Nashville, Tennessee , advised as
follows: .

During May of 1968, he attended a conference
of the National Automobile Dealers Association in Miami Beach,
Florida, which was attended by a number of truck dealers
throughout the United States. One evening during this
series of meetings he was with a group of individuals
including "BUDDY" JENSEN of Fairfield, Connecticut and ARTHUR IRWIN
of Lima, Ohio. Everyone in this group of some twenty to
twenty-five men had been drinking heavily and conversations
could only be described as extremely “alcoholic.”

On one occasion, "BUDDY" JENSEN made some remark
to the effect that ROBERT KENNEDY would never live to become

' President, if he were nominated and elected, that someone

would probably shoot him. JENSEN did not say that he had
attended any meeting where this was: discussed, nor was any
conversation recalled with reference to MARTIN LUTHER KING.

He does not recall any other remarks of JENSEN
and does not recall discussing JENSEN's remarks on a :
subsequent trip to Jamaica, which he made accompanied by
other men at the conference.

He paid absolutely no attention to JENSEN's remark
regarding KENNEDY, since he was drinking heavily, as were most
of the men at the conference. .

He described JENSEN as an “ultra conservative",
@ loyal American, and one who would have no part in the
Geath of KENNEDY or KING,

very crowded and he thereupon hopped out of the ambulance. He
said tnat at this point ETHEL KENNEDY motioned for him to return

Waiters Alliance, Local 17, American Federation of Labor (AFL) -
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), 321 South Bixel
Street, Los Angeles, California, telephone HU 2-9800, advised
the following:

Mr, VALLERO said that he frequently dispatched extra
waiters to the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles but had no
personal recollection of DONALD EVANGELISTA, Social
Security Number who reportedly was hired as an
extra banquet walter a e Ambassador Hotel on May 17, 1968.

Mr, VALLERO ascertained from records of
that DONALD D, EVANGELISTA, Social Security Number
had joined Local 17 on January 19, 1965. Hewas born
June 29, 1943 in Massachusetts. EVANGELISTA was suspended from
Local 17 in July 1965. EVANGELISTA's wife was identified as

appeared in the records, It was noted that in July 1965,
EVANGELISTA had affiliated with Waiters Local 531 at 1192 Fest
Walnut Street, Pasadena, California, telephone 449-3771.

The records also disclosed that on May 17, 1968,
EVANGELISTA had paid $25:00 toward a reinstatement fee of $50.00
to Local 17. There was nothing on the record to indicate that
EVANGELISTA had been dispatched by Local 17 to the Ambassador
Hotel.

Mr, VALLERO voiced the opinion that Mr, EVANGELISTA
when seeking extra work at the Ambassador Hotel on
May 17, 1968, ° may have learned that it was necessary to
reinstate himself with the Waiters Local before he would be
hired, therefore, his payment of $25.00 on May 17, 1968. The bal-
ance of $25.00 due for reinstatement was never paid and the
$25.00 paid on May 17, 1968 was forfeited, according to

Mr. VALLERO,.
