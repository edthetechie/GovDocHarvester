JOHN B. MARQUAND, journalist for the "New York
Review", 250 West 57th Street, New York, New York, vacationing
at Great Pond, Edgartown, Massachusetts, said he was staying
at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, the night
the late Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY was assassinated there
June 5, 1968.

At approximately midnight, June 4, 1968, MARQUAND
was in the serving kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel along with
other journalists and newspaper writers and kitchen employees
of the above hotel awaiting KENNEDY's exit from the hotel via
that area. Since MARQUAND's good friend, GEORGE PLIMPION,
editor and free lance writer, was accompanying KENNEDY,
MARQUAND anticipated a brief interview of KENNEDY as the
latter passed through that area.

Suddenly, as the bodyguards and vanguard of
KENNEDY's group with KENNEDY entered the serving kitchen,
MARQUAND heard what sounded to him like several Chinese
firecrackers going off. Then he saw ROOSEVELT GRIER, ex-pro
football player; RAFER JOHNSON, ex-Olympic athletic star;
GEORGE PLIMPTON; and others seize a frail, small young man
who looked like a teen-age Mexican and hold his right arm
aloft. There was a handgun in his right hand which they
wrestled from him. They then threw him on top of a serving
table and appeared to be “tearing him apart". Because of the
excitement and confusion, MARQUAND failed to note KENNEDY lying
on the floor for some seconds after the above scene took place.
MARQUAND said he subsequently learned through the news media
that the young man with the gun in his hand was SIRHAN B. SIRHAN.

MARQUAND had never seen SIRHAN before the above
incident and did not see him shoot KENNEDY. He knew no one
who knew SIRHAN or who had seen him about the Ambassador

REGULY advised that JOHN BREHL of the "Toronto Star"
is permanently assigned to the home office in Toronto. BREHL
was not in Los Angeles at the time of KENNEDY's assassination,
but flew to Los Angeles the next day to help REGULY cover the
story.

in the Temporary Press Room talking to HILLIARY LAMB. They
were awaiting for an appearance of KENNEDY when they heard
popping sounds and went to the kitchen area. REGULY saw .
KENNEDY on the ground and also saw SIRHAN being held by ROSEY
GRIER, RAFER JOHNSON, and an unknown white man. GRIER had
hold of SIRHAN's hand and gun and was pointing the gun towards
the wall. GRIER then took the gun from STRHAN and passed it to
JOHNSON. REGULY then saw GEORGE PLIMPTON grab SIRHAN.

REGULY had never seen SIRHAN before. He heard
SIRHAN say while he was being held by GRIER and JOHNSON, "I
can explain, I can explain". At this time, GRIER was twisting
SITRHAN's leg.

Out in the hall a girl who was a KENNEDY aide to
FRANK MANKIEWICZ was saying that she had thrown him (meaning
SIRHAN) out twice and that she did not see how he got back in.
REGULY did not know this girl's name, but said she was tall,
large boned, and brunette.

On the evening of June 4, 1968, and the early
morning of June 5, 1968, Mrs. LA HIVE had been at the
Ambassador Hotel during the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
campaign party. Mrs. LA HIVE was not married to Mr.

LA HIVE at the time and her maiden name was ESTELYN DUFFY.

When Senator KENNEDY finished his speech in the
Embassy Room at the Ambassador Hotel, at around 12:15 a.m.
on June 5, 1968, Mr. and Mrs. LA HIVE were standing in a
corridor, a sortof anteroom, behind the stage where Senator
KENNEDY was speaking. When the speech was finished, the
Senator and his party left the stage and passed through the
swinging doors into the kitchen area. Mr. and Mrs. LA HIVE
then started to follow the KENNEDY party toward the kitchen
area. Just before they reached the swinging door area, she
heard some popping noises which at first she did not realize
were gunshots. There were two or three shots, then a slight
pause, then several more shots. :

Mr. LA HIVE at this point voiced the opinion that
it was gunfire they had heard and immediately ran into the
kitchen area to investigate. Mrs. LA HIVE stayed in the ante-
room and did not observe any of the immediate aftermath in
the kitchen. She saw one woman come running out of the kitchen
who had blood on her forehead and soon became aware.after all
the screams and confusion that there had been a shooting
and that the Senator had been shot, as well as several other
persons.

Mrs. LA HIVE stated that she and her husband had
entered the Embassy Room, shortly before the Senator KENNEDY
speech, through the kitchen area,and that she had noted there
were several people in the kitchen area at the time of her
entry whom she felt were employees of the hotelm She had no
recollection of seeing the suspect, SIRHAN SIRHAN, in the
kitchen at that time or of ever having seen him prior to the
time he was apprehended and removed from the area by the
police.

Mr. JOSEPH A. LA HIVE, 4055 Tujunga Avenue,
Apartment 305, Studio City, California, telephone 985-4681,
advised the following:

Mr. LA HIVE, President of the Van Nuys Democratic
Club, attended the Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY campaign party
and speech on the evening of June 4, 1968, and the morning
of June 5, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles,
California. At approximately 12:15 a.m. on June 5, 1968
when Senator KENNEDY finished his speech in the Embassy
Room at the Ambassador Hotel, Mr. LA HIVE and Miss ESTELYN
DUFFY, now Mrs. JOSEPH A. LA HIVE, were standing in a
corridor behind the stage area, a sort of anteroom. Senator
KENNEDY left the stage area and passed on Mr. LA HIVE's left,
followed by his party and proceeded through the swinging
doors into the kitchen area.

Mr. LA HIVE and Miss DUFFY started to follow the
Senator and just about this time, Mr. LA HIVE heard what
sounded to him like gunfire, six or seven shots coming from
the kitchen area. Mr. LA HIVE left Miss DUFFY and rushed to
the kitchen. A woman with blood running down the middle of
her forehead rushed out of the kitchen area toward Mr. LA HIVE.
He noted panic and screams from the people in the kitchen.

LA HIVE at this point observed a man lying on the
floor who appeared to be shot through the head. He later learned
that this man was PAUL SCHRADE. There appeared to be another
man lying on the floor who was not known to Mr. LA HIVE. He
then saw Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor and noted that
blood was coming from a wound at the right ear. He then
observed a struggle going on between some men and noted that
ROSIE GRIER, a member of the Senator KENNEDY party, was headed
toward the struggling group and LA HIVE followed GRIER. At
this point, he saw a gun on a table with about six men's hands
and arms struggling for possession of it. It was noted that
a finger was still in the trigger guard and LA HIVE stepped
in to grab the gun and got hold of the barrel of the gun.
ROSTE GRIER had grabbed the suspect and GRIER had placed
his body on top of the suspect, who had hold of the gun. At
this point, RAFER JOHNSON, member of the Senator KENNEDY
party, arrived ! i

released the gun which had been taken out of the suspect's
hand. Mr. LA HIVE at this point grabbed the suspect's left
leg and threw a leg lock hold on it until the police
arrived five or six minutes later. There was considerable
buffeting around in trying to transfer the suspect to the
police and protect him from people who were shouting, kill
him" and similar remarks. Only one suspect was observed by
Mr. LA HIVE.

Mr. LA HIVE stated that he had some small cuts
on his face and some blood on his suit and face, but he
did not know exactly how they got there.

Mr. LA HIVE at this point returned to the anteroom
area near the entrance to the Embassy Room to join Miss
DUFFY, who had not proceeded to the kitchen with Mr. LA HIVE.

Mr. LA HIVE recalled he and Miss DUFFY, when
they arrived at the Embassy Room shortly before the Senator
KENNEDY speech, were unable to get in through the front
entrance of the Embassy Room so they went to the rear and
came in through the same kitchen area where Senator KENNEDY
had been shot. Mr. LA HIVE said that there were a number
of people in the kitchen at the time whom he thought were
probably employees of the hotel, but made no particular note
of them and had no recollection of having seen the suspect,
later identified as SIRHAN SIRHAN, in the kitchen at that
time. The only time he recalls seeing STRHAN SIRHAN was at
the time of the shooting as described above.

Mr. LA HIVE related that following the removal of
SIRHAN SIRHAN from the Ambassador Hotel by the police, a
number of newscasters had interviewed him in the vicinity
of the Embassy Room at which time he related in substance
the same story which he had furnished the police and the FBI
with respect to his recollection of the incident surrounding
the KENNEDY shooting. He thinks that newscasters for the

MYDA FOOTE is his former mother-in-law. She is alo
known as Myda Fredericks and is married to FREDERICK J. FOOTE,
who also uses the name of Dean Fredericks, They reside in
apartment #8, 1845 Canyon Drive, Hollywood 28, California.

LITTLE was visiting them in Los Angeles, California,
while on vacation from his job, and accompanied them to the
AMBASSADOR HOTEL, Embassy Room, where ROBERT F. KENNEDY was to
speak on June 4, 1968. On the night of June 4, 1968, while
Senator KENNEDY spoke in the Embassy Room of the AMBASSADOR HOTEL,
LITTLE was standing with Mr. and Mrs. FOOTE about 30 feet from
the podium used by Senator KENNEDY.

MYDA FOOTE was then reportedly on Senator KENNEDY's staff
attached to the Mexican-American Committee as a volunteer worker.

LITTLE stateg after Senator KENNEDY finished his speech
and stepped off the podium, he was unable to see him, due to the
large crowd packed into the Embassy Room. He and the FOOTEs
thought Senator KENNEDY would leave the Embassy Room via the
corridor to the lobby and they, therefore, moved toward a large
television set, which was located in the Embassy Room, and toward
the corridor. Instead, Senator KENNEDY left the Embassy Room via
a door leading toward the kitchen and was not seen by LITTLE or
his companions.

LITTLE stated he did not hear any shots fired and did
not see SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN at any time prior to the shooting.
On being shown photographs of SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Department
#BK-495,139, taken on June 5, 1968, he advised he saw this indi-
vidual in the custody of police officers, when the officers brought
him through the corridor of the AMBASSADOR HOTEL after the shooting.
He did not get a good look at him then, due to the large crowd
jammed together.

KENNEDY girls, in uniform, whose identity he did not kEnow,.came
running out of the kitchen to the lobby of the Embassy Room
shouting, "They shot him’. He was unable to hear or determine -
who she was referring to. Later, someone said Senator KENNEDY
had been shot. He then heard someone shouting, ‘Don't kill him".
He thought this person. was referring to SIRHAN.

By this tine, he stated hé made his way to the ‘oor ;
leading from the Embassy Room toward the kitchen and,while there, |
someone said, "Don't let anyone else in". He, thereafter, assisted 4
in keeping people from entering the door leading to the kitchen,. ;
but he did recall he let in three doctors and one priest, while he
was standing there. .

The Newark Division of the FBI advised the following:

On October 28, 1968, ROXANE EBERLEIN, 18 Aiken Avenue,
Princeton, New Jersey, Assistant to JOHN B. MARTIN, advised
that MARTIN, a former Ambassador to the Dominican Republic,
is actively participating in HUMPHREY's election campaign.

She said LAWRENCE O'BRIEN would know how to reach MARTIN, as
would HUMPHREY's secretary or chief aide traveling with him.
EBERLEIN said MARTIN was in the Ambassador Hotel at the time
of KENNEDY's shooting. He had conferred briefly with the
Senator about comments he would include in his address in the
ballroom. KENNEDY left for the ballroom while MARTIN remained
behind. He left the suite to get a smoke inthe hallway and
had intended to observe KENNEDY's speech on television.
Somebody, said EBERLEIN, watching the proceedings, located
MARTIN and told him about the shooting.

EBERLEIN said the foregoing could be attested to by
Mrs. MARTIN who is at their summer home in Nestoria, Michigan,
telephone 906-323-6305. She said MARTIN, to the best of her
knowledge, left no itinerary where he could be located. She
believed him to be traveling either with HUMPHREY or ahead of
him, helping set up speeches and talking to newspapermen, etc.

RONALD ALLEN NORMAN, 17102 Adlon Road, Encino,
California, telephone ST 3-3949, was interviewed at this
Location and furnished the following information:

He is a third year student at the University of
Southern California, Los Angeles.

Between 3:20 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. on dune 4, 1963,
he and an acquaintance, HARVEY PEPPER, 612 North Kings
Road, Los Angeles, arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, 200
Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, to attend a celebration
for Senator ROBERT F., KENNEDY. NORMAN and PEPPER wandered
around the hotel looking for "famous persons" until
approximately 11:20 p.m., at which time they met an acquaintance,
SUB HARRIS, who had been acting as a press secretary for
Senator KANNEDY's campaign in Southern California. HARRIS
provided NORMAN and PEPPER with press passes and suggested
that if they wanted to see Senator KENNEDY, they could wait
in the press room located behind the speakers! platform in
the Embassy Room, since the Senator was expected to pass
through this location following his addresss .

NORMAN and PEPPER then proceeded to this press
room where thirty to forty news media representatives had
gathered to await the completion of Senator KENNEDY's address.
NORMAN recalled that following his address, Senator KENNEDY
proceeded directly through a passage behind the speakers!
platform to a corridor leading to the kitchen area. As
NORMAN proceeded from the press room to this corridor, he
heard screams coming from the kitchen area. He definitely
did not hear any shots fired, or any sounds which he would
have interpreted as such. NORMAN and PEPPER then rushed
into the kitchen area, where they were told that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot. NORMAN recalled that approximately
seventy five persons had already gathered in the kitchen
area and that Senator KENNEDY was lying on the floor. The
area became quite noisy and congested as people continued
to gatner at this location. NORMAN did not observe anyone
wno appeared as though he may have been responsible for the shooting.

NORMAN and PEPPER remained in the kitchen area
for approximately five minutes, after which they proceeded
to a room at the hotel occupied by SUE HARRIS. HARRIS, who
had been packing for her travel to Chicago with the Kennedy
campaign party, had already heard about the shooting on the
television. NORMAN and PEPPER remained in HARRIS! hotel
room for fifteen to twenty minutes, and then left the hotel
at approximately 12:45 a.m., June 5, 1968.

NORMAN was shown a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, including a photograph of this individual taken
June 5, 1968, by the Los Angeles Police Department. After
viewing these photographs, NORMAN advised that he did not
observe anyone resembling this individual at the Ambassador
Hotel on June 4-5, 1963, or anywhere else prior to these dates.
NORMAN was also shown photographs of ADEL SIRHAN, SHARIF
SIRHAN, SATDALLAH SIRHAN, and MUNIR SIRHAN, and after viewing
same, advised that to the best of his knowledge, he has never
observed any of the individuals depicted in these photographs.

NORMAN advised that PEPPER has never indicated to
him that he (PEPPER) observed someone at the Ambassador Hotel
on June 44, 1968, or June 5, 1963, who resembled SIRHAN
“‘BISHARA SIRHAN. NORMAN noted that he was with PEPPER
virtually the entire evening of June 4, 1963, and that he
did not himself observe anyone resembling photographs he
has seen of this individual. NORMAN then volunteered that
PEPPER is a "notorious story teller” who frequently fabricates
or exaggerates his observations or experiences. NORMAN further
described PEPPER as an individual who seeks attention. As an
illustration, NORMAN recalled a recent incident in which
PEPPER, while visiting Las Vegas, was mistaken for a Hollywood
celebrity and, for several days, assumed the identity of this
celebrity to the extent of accepting free room, board, and
publicity from a Las Vegas hotel.

NORMAN was unable to furnish any additional
information regarding the shooting of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

HARVEY PEPPER, 612 North Kings Road, Los Angeles
(653-5365), was interviewed at this location and furnished
the following information:

He was born , and is presently PIl
unemployed.

At approximately 3:30 p.m. on June 4, 1968,
he and one RON NORMAN, current address unknown, arrived
at the Ambassador Hotel, 2400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
Angeles, for the purpose of attending a reception for
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY. From 3:30 p.m. to approximately
11:45 p.m., PEPPER and NORMAN wandered around the hotel
with no particular objective. At approximately 9230 pem.,
as PEPPER and NORMAN were mingling with the crowd in the
main lobby of the hotel, PEPPER observed a young ,sloppily
dressed individual, who he later recognized from photographs
as being identical to SITRHAN BISHARA STRHAN. This individual
was standing with four other individuals, all approximately
NO years of age and dressed in suits and ties, near a
fountain in the lobby. PEPPER recalled that his first
impression was that the four well dressed individuals were
arresting this youth. Although PEPPER did not hear or
observe any words exchanged between the four well dressed
individuals and this youth, these individuals were standing
in a small circle, and PEPPER definitely feels that all were
part of the same group. PEPPER only observed these five
individuals for an instant from a distance of approximately
ten feet. He was unable to describe these individuals,
other than to say that the four well dressed individuals all
appeared to be approximately 40 years of age and light
complected white males, and that the youth, he later
recognized from Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) photo-
graphs as being identical to SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, was
youthful in appearance, slovenly attired, and dark complected.
This latter individual did not appear to have anything in
his hands and was not wearing a hat. PEPPER does not know
whether NORMAN observed these individuals, and PEPPER has
never discussed his observations with NORMAN.

PEPPER noted that at approximately 12:20 a.m.,
June 5, 1963, he again observed the above described youth
being led from the lobby to the entrance of the hotel,
apparently in custody of authorities.

PEPPER was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, ADEL SIRHAN, SHARIF SIRHAN, SAIDALLAH SIRHAN and
MUNIR SIRHAN. After viewing these photographs, PEPPER
stated that he is certain that the photographs of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN are identical to the above described youth
he observed in the hotel lobby. PEPPER indicated that, to
the best of his knowledge, he has never observed the
individuals depicted in the photographs of ADEL SIRHAN,
SHARIF SIRHAN, SAIDALLAH SIRHAN, °* MUNIR SIRHAN, and that
he is positive that none of these individuals resembled
the above described four well dressed individuals he
observed in the hotel lobby.

At approximately 11:45 p.m., PEPPER met an
acquaintance, SUH HARRIS, who had been acting as a press
secretary for the KENNEDY campaign in Southern California.
HARRIS supplied PEPPER and HOWARD with Bress passes and told
them if they wanted to shake hands with Senator KENNEDY, they
should wait in the press room located behind the speaker's
podium in the Embassy Room, since Senator KENNEDY was expected
to pass through this location following his address.

PEPPER and HOWARD then proceeded to this Press
foo, where they remained until Senator KENNEDY finished
a short address in the Embassy Room. PEPPER estimates that
approximately fifty persons, most of them wearing Dress
passes, had gathered in the press room. Senator KENNEDY,
after completing his address, proceeded directly through
the passage behind the speakers! platform to the corridor
leading to the kitchen, thus bypassing the press xoom.
PEPPER proceeded to this corridor, and,upon reaching this
location, heard an unrecalled number of muffled noises,
which sounded like dishes breaking ahead of him in the
corridor. At this point, PEPPER thought that someone had
probably upset one of the stainless steel carts situated
along the sides of the corridor. PEPPER continued through

the corridor to the kitchen area and was unaware that
anyone had been shot until reaching this location and
observing a newsman who had been shot in the hip. PEPPER
recalled that as he passed into the kitchen area, someone
closed and stood in front of the door leading to the corridor.
PEPPER estimated that approximately 100 persons were in the
kitchen at this point. PEPPER passed through a group of
individuals standing near the center of the kitchen and
observed Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor with his head
in a pool of blood. PEPPER observed Senator KENNEDY's lips
moving but did not actually hear any words spoken. More
people began rushing into the kitchen, and the area became
quite noisy and congested.

At no time did PEPPER observe anyone in the
corridor or kitchen area who resembled photographs of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN. Nor did PEPPER observe anyone who appeared as
though he might have been responsible for the shooting.

PEPPER remained in the kitchen area for three or
four minutes and then proceeded to a room at the hotel
occupied by SUH HARRIS. HARRIS had earlier gone to her
hotel room to pack for her travel to Chicago with the
Senator KENNEDY campaign party. By the time PEPPER reached
HARRIS! hotel room, HARRIS had already heard about the
shooting on television, PEPPER remained in HARRIS' hotel
room for between ten to fifteen minutes and then proceeded
to the lonby where he observed the above described individual,
he later identified as being identical to STRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, being led from the lobby to the hotel entrance.
ree left the hotel at approximately 12:45 a.m., June 5,
1995.

Mr. SPISZMAN said he had attended the Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY campaign party at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, _
on the evening of June 4, 1968, and the morning of June 5, 1968.
Following the conclusion of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY's speech
in the Embassy Room of this hotel at approximately 12:15 a.m.,
on June 5, 1968, Mr. SPISZMAN observed Senator KENNEDY and
a group of persons following him leave the stage and move into
a@ corridor leading towards the kitchen. ‘Mr. SPISZMAN at the time
was standing in a small anteroom at the rear of the stage and

. adjacent to the corridor. He at this point heard some

noises which sounded to him as if they were exposed electrical

‘circuits popping. His impression was that perhaps some of the

television cables had broken. He then heard the considerable
noise and confusion coming from the kitchen area and people began
screaming, and he saw one woman coming back towards the

Embassy Room area who had blood on her forehead. He began

to learn from people around him'that therehad been some shooting,
however, he did not observe the shooting and he at this point
went back into the entrance of the Embassy Room where he attempted
to quiet some of the people who were beginning to become hysterical,
He never did go into the kitchen area and consequently did not

see anything that occurred there. He said that he did not

see SIRHAN SIRHAN or any of the victims of the shooting with

the possible exception that the woman with the blood on her

head could have been one of the. victims of the shooting but he was
not aware of her identity or if this was a fact.

: Photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN and members of his
family were exhibited to Mr. SPISZMAN who remarked that he had

no recollection of seeing any of these persons in the photographs.
