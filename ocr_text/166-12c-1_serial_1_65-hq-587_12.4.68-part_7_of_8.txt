following informations He is employed as a sales representa-
tive for Bulova Watch Company. The compan vw had a sales
meeting at Los Angeles, California, in early June, 1968, and
he flew to Los Angeles, registering at the Ambassador Hotel
on or about June 2 or June 3, 1968. ‘The hotel was headquarters
for several political. candidates and their staffs who were
campaigning in a primary election which was held ‘about! that
time. —

Oa the evening of June 4, 1968, TEGUNS and some of
his associates went to the hotel Lobby about 8:00 or 9200 p.m.,
to see some of the dignétaries, and there were many people
in the hotel and a considerable amount of confusion. TEGUNS
explained that the place he referred to as the lobby was
the area.in which the registration desk was located, and. was
on what he described as the mezzanine flocr of the hotel.

After he arid others of his associates had been in
the lobby for several hours, he observed.a number of: persons
coming’ from the area back of the registration desk, and they

“were upset and some of the women were crying and hysterical.

The word spread that ROBERT KENNEDY had been shot, and there

was much confusion and the.crowd in the hotel lobby seemed. to

be stumned. He had heard no shots and had observed nothing

out of the ordinary prior to the reported shooting. - Immediately
after the word spread regarding the shooting 5 virtually all

of the beatniks and Negroes who had been in the hotel lobby,
left the hotel. It was his impression that the police closed

‘off the area. The next day, it was necessary for him and

other. persons registered at the hotel to-obtain passes to leave
and re-enter the hotel, because of the investigation that was.

‘being conducted.

The next day he saw in the local newspaper, photo-~ -
graphs of SIRHAN B. SITRHAN, who was reportedly being held for
the shooting of KENNEDY. He had never seen this person before

MILLARD SHEETS, President, Millard Sheets Design,
Incorporated, 655 East Foothill Boulevard, was interviewed
and advised that he is a self-employed artist and designer
and a retired professor. He advised as follows:

He owned a horse which he kept at the Granja Vista
Ranch near Norco, California, and one Sunday morning late in
September 1966, he was at the ranch. STIRHAN SIRHAN and
several stable boys were there for the purpose of running
some horses and he had seen SIRHAN there two or three months
previously working as an exercise boy but they had little if
any conversation. SIRHAN was courteous, spolte good English,
and appeared to be an ambitious young man and he knew him
then only as SAUL.

On this particular Sunday morning it was very foggy
and he decided not to run his horse but several other persons
wanted to and SIRHAN and several other boys began running
their horses. As they disappeared into the fog on the traci
they were gone hardly five to eight seconds when he heard the
horses squealing and there was a crashing sound and someone
screamed. He said he ran down the track to a distance of about
3/16 mile and he found SIRHAN lying in the dirt against a post
on the railing. He was lying very quietly and appeared to be
unconscious. He still had his helmet on and he moaned. At
first he saw some blood in SIRHAN's ear and suspected an internal
injury, however, he later saw that the blood came from facial
cuts and was merely running into his ear. Within the space of
about two minutes SIRHAN was conscious and appeared frightened
because he could not see due to the mud and blood in his eyes.
He was bewildered anc frightened thinking that ne was blind.

He was clawing at his face and Mr. SHEETS advised that he held
his hands down and comforted the boy holding his head in his
lap while they were waiting for an ambulance. He also removed
the boy's helmet and held him for a period believed to be about
15 to 30 minutes.

STRHAN soon calmed down and made no particular
statements nor complaints about his condition but appeared
to be generally stunned,

He said that he returned to this ranch the second
day after the accident and was surprised to see SIRHAN back
at his job. He was surprised that his face showed very little
injury from the accident and STRHAN walked over and thanked
him for his kindness in helping him after the accident. SIRHAN
made no statement about his physical condition except to say
that he was sore.

Mr. SHEETS said he understood that SIRHAN had also
worked the ranch the previous day which was the day immediately
after the accident, although his duties were restricted to
walking the horses and he was not riding.

information:

PETERS advised that his records indicate that SIRHAN
SITRHAN came to his stables seeking | employment and was hired as
an exercise boy on November 16, 1967. His records further
indicated that this employment wae terminated on November 30,
1957.

PETERS said that he recalled SIRHAN due to the fact
that he appeared to have a superiority complex and "seemed to
be in a fog most of the time." He stated that SIRHAN seemed
to be a well mannered individual most of the time, but that he
had this air of superiority about him which made communication
with him rather difficult.

PETERS further advised that when he decided to hire
SIRHAN as an exercise boy, he gave him easy horses to ride in
order to determine his abilities. SIRHAN was paid $2,00 pex
horse and the records indicate that STRHAN rode 66 head of horses
for the Wheeler Stables during his time of employment.

PETERS further advised that he recalled an incident
about November 25 or 26, 1967, wherein SIRHAN was riding a
horse on the track and was thrown from the saddle. SIRHAN
landed on his feet but was brushed by another passing horse
and was spun to the turf. PETERS related that several exercise
poys ran to aid SIRHAN but that he was only shaken up and did
not require any immediate medical attention. PETERS stated
that he thoveht SIRHAN went to a doctor later in the day but
that tne doctor also indicated that SIRHAN was only shaken up
and did not require any further medical attention. PETERS said
that SIRHAN came to work the next day apparently suffering no
ill effects from the accident from the day before.

PETERS advised that when it was determined that SIRHAN
was not working out as an exercise boy, his employment was
terminated on November 30, 1967. He said that he was reasonably

took its noontime break at Howard Street. The other two men
remained at the truck. SIRHAN began talking to CLARK at

sometimes bring him drinks of lemonade or food and they would
sit near by the truck and talk. They talked about matters
of topical interest, usually everits that had taken place in

white people in this country and said he wished he could "Do

something real bad that would hurt them all." At this par-

ticular time, SIRHAN noticing that CLARK was wearing a

KENNEDY political button on his cap and a KENNEDY sticker

on the truck, commented to CLARK about it, and CLARK said

he was going to vote for Senator KENNEDY for president.

SIRHAN allegedly said "What are you voting for that son of

two conversations were months apart and
SIRHAN taiked of many things, and was proné to exaggeration.

would not want to "take the oath" because he hated SIRHAN
so much that he would do anything to see him convicted.
