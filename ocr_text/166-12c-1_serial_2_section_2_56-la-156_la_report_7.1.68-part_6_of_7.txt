She has been employed at the Golden Garter Bar,
2605 West Valley Boulevard, in Alhambra for the past two
months. She advised that she realizes most of the employees

been a customer at the Golden Garter Bar and had been a
friend of JAMES WILSON. ANDRESE has not been in the bar
in the past three weeks, and prior to that, he had frequented
the bar approximately six to eight times, usually in the
company of WILSON. These visits to the bar were usually
at night, since Miss STURGEON's shift is from 6:00 p.m. to
2:30 a.m,

She related that she could not understand why
the big "fuss" was being made about SIRHAN B. SIRHAN. She
said he has never been a customer at the bar, and it is
apparent to her that the owners of the bar, CARL and ANDY,
have mistaken SIRHAN for ANDRESE, She further advised that
she did not know how they could furnish information to the

other will usually stop by during the evening for approximately
five to ten minutes to check on receipts and handle some

EDWIN GERALD NESS, Inmate, Los Angeles County Jail,
advised as follows:

During the month of May, 1968, he resided with
DOROTHY MANNING, JAMES WILSON, and RHONDA GREEN at an
apartment in Alhambra at 2317 Main Street. During that
time, he was not employed and DOROTHY, whom he was living
with, was employed as a barmaid at the Golden Garter in
Alhambra, Also during this time, JAMES WILSON obtained
employment at a company in Monterey Park, whose name he
could not recall, but he thought it began with "S" and
sounded something like "SCRABBLE," He believed that
WILSON lasted at this employment approximately one week.
WILSON did not own a car, and he was driven to and from
work by an individual whom he (NESS) knew only as BOB. He
believed BOB drove a 1962 Valiant and on several occasions
stopped at the Golden Garter to have a drink with JAMES
WILSON.

NESS was shown @ photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, and he said that this photograph resembled the
individual whom he knew as BOB, with the exception that
BOB combed his hair straight back and had a pockmarked face.

NESS was asked as to what type mail WILSON received
during the period they shared the apartment on Main Street.
He replied that the only mail WILSON received was "bills."

He said that he has known WILSON for the past three years and
has resided with him for the past one month, until they split
up approximately the first of June, 19€8. During that period,
WILSON has never made known his political beliefs, and it is
the opinion of NESS that he is not interested in politics.

Since their split up on June 1, 1969, NESS has had
one contect with WILSON, that being on June 3, 1368, in
Santa Ana, N#&SS said he believes that WILSON is residing
in Santa Ana somewhere near Main Street on either First
or Fourth Street. WILSON's brother, RICHARD, is the manager
of a bar in Santa Ana, California, the "Poor House" or "Pussy

not recognize SIRHAN by name or photograph. He did not recognize
the name BOB ANDRESE. Regarding BOB ALLEN, WILSON advised

he had Known him for about seven years and believed ALLEN
currently lived in Paramount, California. Prior to May

1963, ALLEN lived with JIM WILSON, but they did not get

along too well and split up.

WILSON advised his wife is currently employed as a
barmaid at the Pour House Bar on First Street in Santa Ana,
around the corner from his residence. She began this employment
about June 4, 1968, and works the 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. shift.
WILSON goes over to the bar at 2:00 a.m. to count the money
and close the place. He spends about ten or fifteen minutes
handling this matter and then returns to his apartment.

He said JIM WILSON is generally asleep when he gets home
since JIM gets up so early to go to work.

WILSON advised RHONDA GREEN has a 1964 gray Comet
sedan, which is sometimes used by JIM WILSON since he does
not own a car. The only other vehicle JIM WILSON is known
to have driven recently was BOB ALLEN's white Plymouth.

Regarding the move from Alhambra to Santa Ana
on May 30 or May 31, 1958, WILSON believed the move had
occurred about 6:00 p.m. He said JIM WILSON, RHONDA GREEN,
tne two children and he drove from Alhambra in RHONDA's
Comet and moved into the Santa Ana apartment. All of them
got drunk that night, which is a regular occurrence at the
house. He said they drink frequently, but it is generally
limited to beer. Most of the drinking occurs at home and
they have not been frequenting bars in the Santa Ana area.
Regarding the Golden Garter Bar in Alnambra, WILSON advised
he did not believe he had ever been to tnat Location.

WILSON advised the week end of June 1 and June 2,
1968, involved considerable drinking at the apartment by all
of the adult members of the family so that his recollection
is hazy about that time. He did recall that on June 4, 1968,
which was election day, he and JIM WILSON had worked four
hours for Quick Service, located near Second Street in Santa

Ana, about four blocks from his residence. He recalled
they went there at 6:00 a.m., and obtained a job unloading
a truck about 9:00 a.m. He and JIM worked until about
2:00 p.m., June 4, 1963, making $1.65 an hour for their
labors. He recalled there were elections that day since
they were unable to cash the vouchers for their wages at
a bar until 8:00 p.m., since the bars were closed until
that time. About 2:00 p.m., or shortly thereafter, he and
JIM WILSON returned to the apartment from the employment
and stayed around the house 'the rest of the afternoon. At
8:00 p.m., he and JIM cashed their vouchers at the Spa Bar
on South Main Street in Santa Ana. They took a taxi from
the Spa Bar about one half mile to the Lasso Bar, where
hey had a pitcher of beer and walked home. He said the
Lasso Bar is near the Pour House Bar and he assumed they
got home at 9:30 or 10:00 p.m., but he was not certain. That
evening he and JIM watched television, along with RHONDA GREEN
and ELAINE WILSON. The children were sleeping at the time.
He recalled the election returngwere coming in and there
was a movie which he watched, although he could not recall
the name of it. He recalled seeing Senator ROBERT KENNEDY
make his victory speech concerning the Califomia election
returns followed by reports of the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY. He said ne, JIM and the girls were all quite
shocked about what happened but recalled no specific
conversation about it. He said all of the people went
to bed about 4:00 a.m.

WILSON advised he got up at about 8:00 or 9:00 a.m.,
on June 5, 1968, and observed that the other adults and
children were still sleeping. He went back to bed and
slept again until 10:00 a.m. or so, when he got up and
found JIM WILSON was also up at that time. He recalled
that during June 5, 1963, he, JIM and the girls watched
television most of the day involving the investigation
of the KENNEDY assassination. They were also all drinking
quite heavily and he did not believe they left the residence
jo go anywhere.

it was on June 5, 1968, that he and JIM ned also looked for
some employment. He said JIM WILSON filled out an application
for a job in the City of Orange, Californie, where he had
previously worked or was known. He and JIM nad driven to that
location in RHONDA GREEN's car and were gone several hours
before returning to the apartment. WILSON advised he did
not enter the company from whom his brother was seeking
employment, but rather remained in the car. After they

the balance of the day.
