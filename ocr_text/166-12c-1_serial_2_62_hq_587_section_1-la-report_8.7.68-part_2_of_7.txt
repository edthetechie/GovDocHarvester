When KENNEDY passed her, JENNINGS advised, he smiled
at her and "gave her a little squeeze". JENNINGS advised

that she had had occasion to see KENNEDY several times
duping his stay at the hotel and that he had always smiled
at, whenever they happened to run into one another.

JENNINGS advised that KENNEDY then walked on past
her and began shaking hands with the unidentified dishwasher.
JENNINGS then advised that she heard someone yell, "KENNEDY!"
and then heard two loud reports. At this point, JENNINGS
advised that KENNEDY was about six feet from her. Upon
hearing the two loud reports, she turned and looked at
KENNEDY and saw him falling back toward her. JENNINGS stated
that she did not see him actually hit the floor. She stated
that she did not see the subject SIRHAN, She further stated
she saw no one with a gun. JENNINGS also advised that she
did not notice any blood as KENNEDY was falling. She advised
that she did not notice that any one else had been wounded.

At this point, JENNINGS stated, she became very
frightened and ran out of the room via the door next to the
men's restroom which leads to ‘the lobby of the hotel. She
stated that immediately after hearing the two loud reports,
people began screaming and there was a great deal of pushing
and shoving. She advised that when she ran out of the room,
she ran directly to the Venetian Room which is across the
lobby from the Embassy Ballroom.

JENNINGS stated that she went to a pay telephone
pooth in the Venetian Room and called her mother, Mrs.

JENNINGS advised that she then just wandered around
for awhile and then walked into a women's restroom downstairs
in the same area. She stated that she began crying over
the preceding events, and while doing so, two women came in
and asked why she was crying. JENNINGS stated that she
advised one of the women that she was crying because Senator
KENNEDY had been shot, and that she had been there when it
had happened. One of the women commented to her that it was
a terrible thing to have happened and said that she had been
in the Embassy Ballroom while KENNEDY was making his victory
speech.

JENNINGS stated that she then just "walked around"
the hotel until four or five o'clock in the morning. She
stated that there were so many people around that she was
unable to get any work done anyway.

At around dawn, JENNINGS advised she went back to
the men's restroom by the kitchen where the shooting occurred
with the purpose of cleaning it. When she entered there
were several police officers in the restroom washing their
hands. She stated that she emptied a waste basket near the
door and in the course of doing so, noticed a brown
alligator wallet lying on the floor next to the waste
basket. JENNINGS advised that she picked up the wallet, and
without looking at its contents, walked outside into the
kitchen and gave it to a policeman in plainclothes. She
stated that at this point a uniformed officer asked what she
was doing there and took her name and address.

JENNINGS stated that she then went to the Coconut
Grove and cleaned the restrooms there. By the time she had
completed that task, JENNINGS advised, it was eight o'clock
and she left to return home.

JENNINGS reiterated that at no time during the
evening did she see anyone resembling SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN,
nor did she see anyone shooting. ©. She also repeated that when
she saw the Senator begin to fall, she panicked and ran from
the room. She could recall nothing further about the incident.

"On June 4, 1968, I reported for work at the
Ambassador Hotel two hours earlier than my shift was
to begin; that is 12 midnight. I always report for
work early due to the fact the buses quit running at
10 PM.

"At about 12:10 or 12:15 a.m. on June 5, 1968, I
carried some glasses into the Embassy Room Service Pantry
from the hallway just outside the men's restroom located
just outside the Embassy Room Service Pantry. I placed
these glasses on the far end of the steam tables where
the entrance way from the kitchen employee's dining
room into the Embassy Room Service Pantry is located.

I left the pantry at that time, and went back into the
main lobby. I walked down the stairs next to the
Lautrec Restaurant, and as I reached the last stair,
decided to return to the Embassy Room Service Pantry.

"When I arrived inside the’ Embassy Room Service
Pantry, I walked between the steam tables and ice makers
toward the entrance way into the kitchen employee's
dining room. Seconds later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy
came through the swinging doors leading from the Embassy
Room into the Embassy Room Service Pantry. Kennedy was
surrounded by several men, one of whom I recognized as
Roosevelt Grier, a member of the Los Angeles Rams
professional football team. As Kennedy passed me, he
nudged me on the arm and continued to walk through
pantry. I turned away from the direction he was walking,
and immediately heard a male voice yell, "Kennedy", one
time. Instantly I then heard two gunshots. I turned
toward Kennedy and saw him collapse back toward me.

That is all I saw, for I immediately ran through the
kitchen employee's dining room and out the swinging doors
at the other end of the Embassy Room Service Pantry. I
honestly don't recall where I went after hearing the

two shots but can only guess that I went through the
dining room and Room Service area because I heard no
more shots or saw the person who fired the gun.

"I immediately ran to a phone booth in the Venetian
Room located across the main lobby and called my mother,
Mrs. Gertrude Manley, 722 Fast 115th Street, Los Angeles,
telephone number 755-0588. All I can recall telling her
was that Senator Kennedy had been shot. At that time,
I saw a Security Guard with a Mexican male who was
handcuffed. I later learned from the Los Angeles Police
Department on June 21, 1968, that the above individual
had been released.

"After making the telephone call, I went down to
the Casino Floor where I saw my supervisor, Major Hayden.
He told me to continue my work. I went to one of the
ladies restrooms near the dress shop on the Casino
Floor, when I ran into two Negro teachers, I mentioned
to them I was in the Embassy Room Service Pantry when
Senator Kennedy was shot. After talking with them for
about five minutes, I resumed working until 8:00 A.M.,
June 5, 1968, when my work shift ended, and I went home.
"IT did not see the person responsible for shooting
Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The only reason I knew he had
been shot when I ran from the pantry was that I heard
the two gunshots and saw him begin to collapse, I did
not see any smoke from a gun, blood from Kennedy's body or
anything that would assist in determining who shot Kennedy.
I have been the photograph of Sirhan B. Sirhan and it is
not familiar to me. I have seen Sirhan's picture in the
newspapers and on television,but prior to that time I
have never seen him. In addition, nothing came to my

attention prior to the shooting to indicate it would take
place.

until about 3:30 a.m., when they went to the Central Receiving
Hospital to see if they could find Dr. MILLER or any of the

BRADEN said he had no personal knowledge of the reason
Senator KENNEDY proceeded in the direction of the ColonialLRoom
rather than the ballroom where his supporters were however, he
had conversation with BILL BARRY, while traveling on the funeral
train on June 8, 1968 concerning the change. He said BARRY
told him he and another person, possibly JERRY BRUNO (phonetic),
had checked the area the Senator was to have proceeded and that
the Senator, without prior notice told him, “let's go this way",
thereby causing BARRY to be behind the Senator as BARRY had
planned on going in the direction of the ballroom to meet the
Senator's supporters. Continuing, BRADEN further said BARRY
told him, "I.kicked Sirhan off the platform three times while
the Senator was behind the microphone", referring to the evening
of June 4, 1968. He said BARRY felt very badly during the trip
and he did not know if he would recall their conversation.

BRADEN said he had heard a rumor from an unrecalled
source that it was Mr. UNO (phonetic), Banquet Manager of the
hotel who was the person who suggested the Senator proceed in
the direction of the ColonidlRoom. BRADEN said the Senator had
a definite practice of following the suggestion of advisors
when in.crowds and it was BRADEN's Opinion someone suggested to
the Senator he walk in the direction he did, as it was a short
way out or gave him some other quick reason which caused him to
change his previous plan of departure from the ballroom.

ANN FERGUSON was interviewed at her place of
employment, 7250 West Beverly Boulevard, at which time she
furnished the following information:

She was a volunteer for Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
and at approximately 6:15 pm, on June 4, 1968, she and BILL
COX went to the Ambassador Hotel to await the results of the
California primary. Upon arriving at the hotel, both she
and COX went directly to the Embassy Room where they remained
until about 10:30, or 11:00 pm, when she went to the Ballroom
to get a drink,

After getting the drink in the Ballroom, the guard
at the door to the Embassy Room would not allow her to re-
enter the room. She then went to the Press Room, where the
guard allowed her to enter the kitchen, and by passing
through the kitchen, she returned to the Embassy Room. At
the time of passing through the kitchen, she noticed no
one, but in an area adjacent to the kitchen, she found a small
room full of men she had not seen before and whom she
assumed were members of the press.

She was in the Embassy Room during Senator
KENNEDY's victory speech standing near the back of the crowd.
After Senator KENNEDY had finished his speech, ERWIN STROLL,
who was standing near the kitchen door, beckoned to her to
follow him out of the kitchen. At this point, Senator
KENNEDY had left the podium and was passing through the
kitchen. The reason STROLL had attempted to have her follow
him was because he, STROLL, had a gift which he was going to
present to Senator KENNEDY, and she was supposed to be
present when the gift was received.

As she was attempting to get to this door, STROLL
went through the door and disappeared into the crowd. Just a
few moments after he disappeared she heard several bangs
which sounded like breaking balloons. After these bangs,

STROLL comes back through the door and says to her, "My
God, ANN, I'm shot." At first she did not believe STROLL
and thought that he was just joking again, but she then
noticed the blood on his leg. She then called for BILL COX
to help ERWIN. COX came to ERWIN and along with DAVID
ESQUITH helped STROLL out of the Embassy Room.

About this time a man said that BOBBY KENNEDY
has been shot and she calledout for a doctor. At the same
time, as she was calling for a doctor, a woman aided by a
man came out of the same door that STROLL had come from.
This woman had blood on her face, but she was walking.

By now several people were shouting for doctors, and someone
was requesting that the crowd stand back. Still later some-
one askedfor ice.

At this point, BILL COX returned.to the Embassy
Room and askedher if she was okay. Then she and BILL left
the Embassy Room and met Mrs. TIFFANY JONAS, who was crying
and saying that they should be with ERWIN since he has been
hurt. Mrs. FERGUSON then drove herself, TIFFANY JONAS, and
BILL COX to the Central Receiving Hospital, where they
stayed until ERWIN STROLL's parents arrived at the hospital.

After STROLL's parents arrived at the hospital,
she returned to the Ambassador Hotel with DAVID ESQUITH.
ESQUITH picked up his car and they both returned to their
homes.

FERGUSON observed a photograph of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN and advised that she does not recall seeing him at
the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, but recalls seeing
someone resembling him at the Kennedy For President Headquarters,
Wilshire Boulevard, on Tuesday, June 3, 1968. She said that
she could not positively identify this man as being SIRHAN,
put thought that there was a close resemblance. The man she
saw at the headquarters had on a white snirt and tan trousers.
She does not recall what this man was doing at the headquarters.
