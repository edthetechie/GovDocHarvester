political campaign to come". ‘ :

-On 7-15-68, at approx. 9 PM, Mrs. STERNS was again re-interviewed
by telephone. She still insisted that she saw Sixhan at the
Kennedy Hqs. on June 4, 1968. When she was told that that was
almost impossible due to Sichan's other activities on that date,
she suddenly changed her tone of voice, and very nastily answered
"So. you have all this information, and I made a mistake. What
do Sf care" Mcs. STERNS then was asked if she now admits making
a mistake regarding hex observa Lions at the Kennedy Has., to
which she replied "No, I'm not going to-admit anything. If 1
made a mistake, I'm not going to adwit it now"!

Twenty~four names appeared on the volunteer worker cards sub-
mitted by Khaibar Khan at Kennedy Headquaxtexs. The names were
acquired by Khan through personal and telephonic interviews.
Khan algo used names of members of his family. Khan did not
request identification or addresses from the volunteers he
interviewed, He used his former wife's (Talat Khan) residential
address, 104555 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, on all the

cards he submitted. These names were checked through the

telephone directory with negative results.

Khan also used the names of members of an organization known

as the. "United Patrons for Justice," of which he is the chair-

man. Khan stated that the organization is comprised of a group
of men striving for a better Iran. These men were allegedly in
“Iran at the time the cards were submitted, but they were to be-
in the U.S. during the November election. He volunteered the

‘services of his members without contacting them.

.

These names were checked through immigration for dates of entry
‘and present whereabouts. Records show that none of these
persons entered the U.S. between the period of June 1968
through December 1968. A total of 34 names were submitted by
Khan, of which only members of his family could be located. |
‘Those interviewed were Rose, Shirin and Parah Khan (daughtérs),
Philippe Menomm (son), Amir Khan (son) and Talat Khan (former
wife). The subjects could offer no information regarding the
investigation.

It has previously been reported that various
‘individuals traveling, particularly in the Middle East,
alleged that they heard radio broadcasts concerning the
assassination of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY prior to the
time that the actual event occurred. Investigation was
conducted in foreign countries in an attempt to substantiate
these reports. Through the Department of State, information
was received that the Press and Cultural Attache at the . __
Embassy at Prague oueried individuals working for the State
Radio station in Prague. Station officials denied ever
having transmitted a bulletin suggesting that Senator
KENNEDY had been assassinated on May 15, 1968.

' One Embassy Officer did report hearing a news-
cast on approximately May 15, 1968, originating from
Deutschland,"Funk’ The station released the bulletin
based on information received from a-common news. service.
Several minutes later, a retraction was made, claiming the.
original report was not accurate reporting of an incident in
_which tre Senator flinched from the glare of nearby flash
bulbs. The possible report heard via broadcasting channels.
in Prague originating outside of "ossa" The report reflects
that the Embassy at Prague was unable to obtain further
information on the origin of the.report or facts which
might’ shed additional information on the subject.

The following information was received from the.
Oklahoma City Office:

It has been determined that "BIG BOY" RYAN is
identical to IRL RHYNES.
RHYNES was interviewed at his ranch,. East Jesse,
Oklahoma. RHYNES was given a copy of "Your Rights" form, as
well as a waiver of rights form and was ‘explained certain
rights as outlined. When asked to waive his rights and
execute the form by affixing the signature thereto, he stated |
he would not sign the form at ‘this time, based upon the advice
of his attorney, but that he would answer any questions that
may be asked. RHYNES stated further he understood all his rights
as outlined on the form and had nothing to hide.

RHYNES was explained the basic organization and aims
of the Minutemen organization, how they obtain funds and
members and asked whether he had ever donated funds to an
organization by that name or whether he had ever been a member
of that organization. In answer to both questions RHYNES
stated emphatically he had never been approached by them
for any reason whatsoever andthat he was not now or had he
ever been a member of the Minutemen organization. In
addition, RHYNES stated he knows he is. considered a radical
in his community and in the business world, not only in his
politics but in the management of his business affairs, but
that the only radicalism that he knows is "being radical for
his country and for his farm" RHYNES stated further that
based on the original aims of “the Minutemen organization,
that had they approached him during the early period of their
development, he may have furnished them some funds; however,.
now, because of the stated aims of their leader, ROBERT DE PUGH,
and other leaders, he would not give them a dime.

RHYNES was then made aware of the aims and objectives
as well as the people who are backing the "Patriotic Party"
RHYNES stated emphatically again that he had never been approached
and that he was not now or had ever been a member of this

~103-


--- Page 48 ---
LA 56-156 . ; oo
—AOR/m1§

political party and had never contributed any funds to them.
RHYNES was appreciative of being made aware of the aims of
this party and the nemes of some of the members backing

this party and stated that since their aims were not the
same as his, he would not in any way allow himself to become
affiliated with them.

At this point, RHYNES was made aware.of Federal
statutes concerning the possession of illegal automatic
weapons and other machine guns. RHYNES stated he had never
purchased machine guns or other automatic weapons, but that
he had many weapons in his possession. Most of these
weapons were shotguns and .22s' utilized by his grandson and
him, as well as friends who visit the ranch.

At this point, RHYNES took the interviewing agents
on a tour of the house, displaying his vast collection of
shotguns and shotgun ammunition utilized.by hunting parties
on his ranch. When asked specifically if he owned any M16
_ automatic rifles, RHYNES stated hedid not own any M16. rifles

put that he did have some AR 15's and would be happy to dis-
play them to the interviewing agents. These AR 15 rifles
were tnen produced from under the bed in his bedroom, two
in number, and were examined by the interviewing agents and
fourd not to be of the automatic type. The fire control levers
on both weapons had positions for safe-and fire, but no
positions for automatic firing. Both weapons were checked
to see if they had been internally tampered with so they could
“be fired automatically and they were. both found to be set
up as’ delivered from the factory. RHYNES stated he possesses
these weapons for protection of his household only and that
any stories that might have accrued about him were probably
as a result of his boasting at various times that he had some
automatic weapons and that he would shoot people who trespassed
onto his property. He knew this to be a falsehood, but he
stated, "My mouth has got me in trouble before."

~104-

RHYNES was displayed Identification Orders 4176: on
ROBERT BOLIVAR DE PUGH and 4181 on WALTER PATRICK PEYSON.
RHYNES stated he had never met either of these individuais

and that under other assumed names or any other circumstances
he was sure he had not seen either of these men. RHYNES
stated further that he would notify the FBI immediately if

he should hear anything concerning either of these individuals.

On March 11, 1969, BURL GRIFFIN, Sheriff, Pontotoc

- County, Ada, Oklahoma, who is'personally acquainted with
RHYNES, advised SA J. ROBINSON FIELD that RHYNES is generally
considered to be a ‘big talker, is very boastful and fr’. is
not taken seriously by those who know him. It should be
noted that when RHYNES was interviewed above, he admitted
having firearms at his home but none of these firearms are
considered illegal.
