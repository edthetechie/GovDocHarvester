TO: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. 8S. J. Fapich

’ FROM: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT: Report on Rumor About Robert Kennedy Being Shot

1. This office has been informed of a rumor similar to
that reported in our out teletype number 06680 of 8 June 1968,

: 2. On 23 July 1968 our representative in Mogadiscio,

Somalia, was contacted (but not deliberately sought out) by

a Mr. J. Christian Kinney, a United States citizen, who volun-

teered information about a rumor of Robert Kennedy having been

,Shot. “ir. Kianey reported that on 18 May 1968 he stoprpea in

asirat, Lekanon, while enroute to Mogadiscio, with his :

Bnd child, On vhe evening entered the Pa

cia Sax, Phoenicia Hotel, Yeiz ‘gut one-half hour ber
-Glosing time. This was either 2130 oy 2235 hours according
to Mr. Kinney. At the bar Mr, Kinney stvuck up a casual
conversation with a Mr. Joseph Strong, a United States citi-
zen, During the conversation Mx. Strong inquired if Mr.
Kinney had heard that Robert Kennedy had been shot. Mr.

. Kinney revlied that he had not, and Mr. Strong said that he

/| had heard this just before coming to the bar from a man he

ge nes

did not identify. Mr. Kinney and Mr. Strong reportedly felt
that if this were true it would appear in the newspapers the
next day, which, of course, it did not.

3, On 19 May Mr. Kinney left Beirut for Jidda, Saudi
Arabia, where his company has business. He questioned some
of his colleagues in Jidda whether they had heard a story
about Robert Kennedy having been shot, The colleagues dis-
claimed having heard this so Mr. Kinney attributed the story
to being a "typical Middle East coffee house rumor", and for=
got about it. Mr. Kinney also met Mr. Strong in Jidda during
the week _of 19 May, and no. mention was made by either party
“about the rumor that Robert Kennedy had been shot.
: 4. According to our representative in Mogadiscio Mr.
j J. Christian Kinney is employed as a consultant by the Middle —
| West Service Company, 69 West Washington Street, Chicago,
‘i —"Lllinois. He presently is assigned to Mogadiscio as the chief
consultant to the Mogadiscio Water Age ted States

Agency for International Development (USAID) project. Mr.
Kinney is described as being a bright, pleasant, young man
in his early thirties who appears to know his business, and
is well thought of by USAID officials in Mogadiscio. His
wife is reported to be Ecuadorian, and they have one child,

5, The files of this office contain no identifiable
information on J. Christian “inney, Our representative in
Mogadiscio reports that Mr. Kinncy presently is undergoing
a security check for the purpose of permitting him to have
access to "need-to-know" classified information in connec-
tion with the USAID Mogadiscio water project. It is possi-
ble, therefore, that USAID Washington may have information
on Mr. Kinney.

6. Our representative in Mogadiscio reports that Mr,
Kinney described Mr, Joseph Strong as being the Middle. Hast.
_ Sales Manacer for. Raytheon, According to Mr. Kinney, Mr.
“Strong ig based in New York and travels to his sales terri-
tory several times a year. It is possible that Mr. Strong
may be identical with Joseph Addington Strong who was born
on 5 October 1911 at Chattanoogs, Tennessee, According to.
information dated mid~-1967 "Joseph. Addington Strong resided
at 743 Wellesley Street, Weston, Massachusetts, “He was
employed by the Raytheon Company, Wayland, Massachusetts,
as International Sales and Projects Manager, Surface Radar
and Navigation Operation, He has been employed by Raytheon
since 1950.

7. ‘(This office conducted national agency checks on
Joseph Addington Strong in 1964, The checks included the

Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI); Department of State,

Passport Section; House Committee on Un-American Activities;
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The checks developed
no unzavorable information, in 1962 ONI completed a favorable
background investigation on Strong, The investigation was
predicated on his civilian duties in a contract capacity.

Strong stated Abdel-Malek was reading an Arabic
language newspaper, apparently purchased by him in Rome
prior to the flight, and he commented to Strong about an
article in the paper reporting a rumor to the effect that
United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy had been shot.
Strong stated that he himself was unable to read the
article inasmuch as he could not read or translate Arabic.

Strong stated he recalled commenting about the

- article to an unidentified American male later on May 18, 1968,
in a bar in Beirut; but he never read or heard anything
further in newspapers: or on radios concerning the rumor

‘in the days immediately following May 18, 1968.
