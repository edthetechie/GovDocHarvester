1 . ; a Date 6/8/68

HENRY ADRIAN CARREON furnished the following signed
statement:

"6/7/68
\ : Los Angeles, Calif.

"I, HENRY ADRIAN CARREON, hereby give the
following voluntary statement to GEORGE M. KLING
and ROLAND H, BROYLES who have identified them-

. Selves to me ag agents of the FBI. This statement
may be used in any manner deemed necessary.

‘T am 19 years old, born 10/30/48; at Los
Angeles, Calif. I currently reside at 1838 Work-
man, Los Angeles. I am employed by the Los Angeles
City School Districts as a playground director.

I currently attend Fast L. A. College, majoring in
Police Science. This is my freshman year.

"On Tuesday, 6/4/1968 at approximately 11:00

. aem. DAVID MONTELLANO and myself attended the San
Gabriel Rifle Range for target shooting. DAVID re-
sides at 3324 Maceo St., Los Angeles.

"After shooting on the riffle range, we noticed

/an individual shooting very rapidly on the pistol range
which is beside the rifle range. At this time we

decided to start shooting our own pistols, a .22

Colt magnum. Noticing the individual down the range
‘;was shooting rapidly, we decided to approach him and
inquire about the weapon. DAVID asked him if the
weapon was a 33 and he replied 'No, it was a .22
caliber.' Then I asked him how many bullets the
pistol was able to hold and he replied, ‘it is an
_€ight shot pistol.' I then asked him if it was a
single or double action and he replied 'it is single'.
“It wae only obvious he didn't know much about the gun
as we could see that it was double action. He finally
said that we had gotten him confused and that the pistol

"Was double action. I asked him what make the gun
was and he didn't answer. I asked again and he said
‘it was an Iver ~- Johnson’ and shewed me the in-
sceription on the barrel which verified this.

"This individual then ask_us if we hunted and
we answered 'no, we had just begun learning about
pistols.' I believe I asked him if he hunted him-
self and he said, 'I just started shooting myself'.
DAVID asked him about a special box of bullets which
he had on the support in front of him. The brvicgts
were mini-magnum. He also had several boxes of re-
gular ammunition. The box of mini-magnum was about
1/3 gone. He had about 400 empty casings to the

‘right of him which he had apparently fired.

"The individual asked DAVID how to obtain better
accuracy thru the sight pattern and they discussed
briefly and then DAVID and I left the range at appro-
Ximately 2 pm. The individual was still shooting.

"After Senator KENNEDY's attempted assassination
early in the morning of June 5, 1955 DAVID and I heard
the description of the suspect and the gun used and
decided it matched the description of the individual
we had seen and talked with at the range and the gun
likewise matched. We decided to call the police.

"The individual at the range was about 22 to 23
yrs of age, thin build, weighing about 135 pounds, about
~5'5" to 5'6" tall, dark complexion with curly black
or brown hair. It was apparent that he was of a
foreign extraction. He spoke with some type of accent
not readily known to me. He was wearing a long sleeve
_ beige or white shirt with stripes and light blue jeans.
I noticed no apparent scars or identifying marks. I
“saw no one with him and noticed no automobile.

"After we called the police, Detective LOU
ESTRELLA of Homicide Division, Central, LAPD came
down with six mug shots. DAVID and I both picked

. out one mug shot as definitely being the individual
' we had seen at the range. We did not know his name
at that time and didn't know it until we heard the

name on television.

I have read tne above statement consisting of
this page and three (3) others, initialed each page
and correction and believe it to be true to the best
of my knowledge.

On June 12, 1958, Special Agents GEORGE M. KLING and
CHARLES W. BADGLEY contacted DAVID RALPH MONTELLANO and identified
thenselvee as agents of the FBI. MONTELLANO stated that he was
willing to talk to the FBI and provided the following information:

MONTELLANO stated that he is currently residing at 3314
Maceo, is 20 years of age, and is currently unemployed.

On June 4+, 1958, he and HENRY CARREON decided to go to
the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, 4001 Fish Canyon Road, Duarte,
California, and to do some target shooting. He stated that they
arrived at the range at approximately 11:30 a.m., and after securing
their targets, went to the rifle range in order to fire a .22
caliber Marlin carbine rifle. After firing several rounds, MONTELLANC
said that he and CARREON heard some rapid firing coming from the
pistol range, which is adjacent to the rifle range. MONTELLANO
said that he and CARREON discussed the matter briefly and then
decided to go to the pistol range to see what kind of weapon was
being uged in connection with this rapid firing.

MONTELLANO advised that he and CARREON then went to
the pistol range and at the far end of the range they saw anindividua?
whom he described as approximately 5'4" ~ 515" in height, 115-120
pounds, dark complexion, bushy haired, and dressed in light colored
clothing, firing around gun position four or five. MONTELLANO
said that he asked the individual, "Is that a .38?7" and the individua”
replied, "No, it's a .22." MONTELLANO stated that he observed
about six boxes of Super X Western .22 long rifle shells in front
of the individual on the bench, and two boxes of .22 caliber mini
magnum shells He stated that he thinks CARREON asked the
individual if “hig gun was single or double action. He stated
that the individual replied “It's single action"; however, he
later changed hig mind and said, "I was confused, it's double
action." MONTELLANO stated that on one occasion, the individual
showed he and CARREON the weapon, and he personally observed

that it wag anIver-Johngson eight shot .22 caliber pistol with
an approximate 2" barrel.

MONTELLANO gtated that the individual was firing at
a target set out gome distance in front of the firing position,
and that he saw many holes in the target; however, many of
these holes were in the white portion of the target rather than
the black, and he, MONTELLANO, was under the impression that
the individual was not a very good shooter.

MONTELLANO stated that it was approximately 1:00 p.m.
when he and CARREON went to the pistol rangé, watched and engaged
the individual in convergation, and left the range at approximately
1:30 or 1:45 p.m. He stated that the actual time spent watching
and conversing with the individual was approximately 20 minutes.

He gtated that the individual was still at the range to the best
of his knowledge, when he and CARREON left.

MONTELLANO further advised that one thing that he remembers
about the incident was that the individual kept his spent cartridge
casings in a pile on the firing bench to the individual's right.

He stated that it appeared as if he might be wanting to save the
cartridge casings. He estimated that there were 400 to 500 of
these casings piled on the bench,

MONTELLANO further stated that he recalled a party of
four people being around the rifle range when he and CARREON were
there and that he later recalled this party being on the pistol
range while he and CARREON were watching and talking with the
individual at the far end of the range. He etated that this party
consisted of a man described ag 5!2"-613" tall, about 245-250
pounds, husky build, late 3Ots, and short hair. A woman described
ag 22-28 years of age, 5'"-5'5" in height, nice build and well
developed, shoulder length blondish hair; and two, possibly teenage
boys, one described only as about 18 years of age and wearing,
light colored jeans; and the other described as about 15 years of
age, hippie hair cut, sideburns, wearing a dark shirt with white
tie and with pinstripe or checked trousers.

TA 56-156

MONTELLANO stated that this party was firing a .32
caliber chrome plated gun, with white or pearl handles, and
possibly a magazine loaded automatic. He stated that at least
on one occasion he recalls either the man or one of the boys
gave assistance to the woman who was firing the gun. He said
that earlier when he and CARREON were on the rifle range, he
remembered this party being there, and he recalled the man said
something to the effect, "She hag never shot a pistol before
and I wanted to teach her." He said that he thought he would
recognize the man and the younger of the two boys if he were
to gee them again; however, he doubted if he would recognize the
woman and the other boy. He stated that he had the impression
that the party was a man andhis younger wife and two. sone or
possibly a man, hig daughter, and two sons,

MONTELLANO further advised that ne, at no time, saw
the individual firing at the far end of the pistol range,come
over to converge with,or observe the four membere of the party.
during their time on the pistol range or rifle range.

MONTELLANO, upon being shown pictures of various
individuals, picked out a photograph of STRHAN SIRHAN as
positively being the individual whom he had seen firing at the
far end of the pistol range, and had engaged in conversation.
MONTELLANO stated that he is aware that SIRHAN is currently
under arrest for the assassination of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY
and he is certain that the individual at the range was SITRHAN
SIRHAN,

MONTELLANO stated in conclusion, that if he Could recall

any additional detaile regarding the occurrences on the firing
range that he would contact the Los Angeles FBI Office.

LLOYD JOHN HAGER, Range Manager, San Gabriel
Valley Gun Club, 4001 Fish Canyon Road, Duarte, California,
provided the following information to Special Agents
GEORGE M. KLING and ALDO A, GIANNECCHINI after identifying
themselves as Special Agents of the FBI.

HAGER advised that he was on duty at the gun
club on June 4, 1968. Upon being shown photographs of
individuals including SITRHAN SIRHAN, he advised that he did
not recognize the individual as being a shooter at the range
on that day. However, HAGER advised, his records indicate
that an individual signed in with the name SIRHAN SIRHAN on
June 4, 1968. HAGER stated that he had notified the Los Angeles
Police Department that SIRHAN's name appeared on these records and
it was his understanding that police officials requested the record
with the name SIRHAN SIRHAN be retained until they picked it up.

HAGER stated that they maintained two rosters of
Shooters at the gun club. One roster contained signatures
of gun club members only who are snooting on any particular
day and the other roster is for non-members. He noted that
SIRHAN's name appeared on the non-member roster. In addition,
he stated that everyone who shoots at the range is supposed
to sign one roster or the other but often times this is not

done.

EVERETT CARL BUCKNER, SR., who resides at 129 East
Bennett Street, Glendora, California, telephone number 963-5583,
and is employed as Line Officer, San Gabriel Valley Gun Club,
4001 Fish Canyon Road, Duarte, California, provided the following
information to Special Agents GEORGE M. KLING and ALDO A.
GIANNECCHINI after identifying themselves as Special Agents of
the FBI:

BUCKNER advised that he was on duty as the Line
Officer for the gun club on June 4, 1968, At approximately
G:30 to 10:00 a.m., an individual came to the range and signed
the non-member shooting roster with the name SIRHAN SIRHAN,
696 East Howard, Pasadena. BUCKNER stated that he later
recognized a picture on television of SIRHAN, a suspect in the
assassination of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, as being identical
to the individual whom he had seen on the range on dune 4, 1968.
BUCKNER stated that SIRHAN had in his possession a .22 caliber
pistol with clip and after receiving a target, went to shooting
position number 1 on the pistol range. After firing for approxi-
mately 15 minutes, SIRHAN returned to BUCKNER and asked, "What
are your best shells? Have you got some that will not misfire?”
After a short conversation, BUCKNER stated he sold SIRHAN a box
of shells but he is not sure what type. SIRHAN then returned
to position number 1 and started firing again.

Approximately 15 minutes later, a man and a woman
came to the range counter. BUCKNER stated that he could
describe the male only as white, 30-40 years of age, and slender
puild. He described the woman as 25-30 years of age, 516" -
5'8", 135 pounds, husky build, blonde hair ~- approximately
shoulder length and wearing a light colored dress. BUCKNER
stated he could not recall if the man and woman signed either
the non-member or member roster prior to shooting. The man
said, "I want to shoot rifle, she wants to shoot pistol."
BUCKNER then told the man that he could not shoot the rifle
and pistol on the same range and he, BUCKNER, then asked the
man, "Would you like to go with your wife first", and the man
replied angrily, "That is not my Goddamn wife," and then said

to the woman, "You go over there by yourself." He then told

the woman, "You'll have to go by yourself because you have to
learn how to shoot that pistol today". BUCKNER stated the woman
then turned to him and said, "I've had this gun a long time and
I have to learn how to shoot it. This is the first gun I've
ever owned and I've never shot a gun before."

BUCKNER advised that he gave each the proper target
and the woman then went to the pistol range and the man went
to the rifle range. BUCKNER stated that he placed the woman's
target in place for her around gun position number 24, which is
at the oppositeend of the pistol range of the number 1 gun
position from which SIRHAN was firing. BUCKNER stated the woman
then started shooting but could not hit the target and asked
him for help and BUCKNER told her that he was not allowed to
do so. The woman continued firing and after a few minutes, SIRHAN
came over to the woman and said, “Here, I'll show you how to
shoot that." The woman said, "Get away from me, you son of a
bitch; they'll recognize you." BUCKNER stated that he was
approximately five feet away from SIRHAN and the woman during
this conversation. SIRHAN then took the gun away from the
woman and proceeded to show her how to line up the sights for a
proper Sight picture. He returned the gun to the woman and
she fired and hit the bulls-eye. She continued firing for
approximately 15-30 minutes with SIRHAN beside her. After
that SIRHAN left her and returned to the number 1 gun position.

Approximately 10 minutes after this, the man with whom
the woman had apparently come to the range with came over to the
woman on the pistol range and removed her target and returned
to the bench with it. The woman said, "See, I got a bulls-eye".
The man said, "Yes, Goddamn you, that was an accident. Look
at all these wild shots." BUCKNER stated that the man then
returned the targets. BUCKNER stated that after returning the
targets to the shed, the man and woman left the range. BUCKNER
stated that he did not notice an automobile. He stated that he
would estimate this time as approximately 11:00 to 11:30 A.M.,
although he said it could have been as much as an hour or s0
later.

BUCKNER stated that SIRHAN left the range approximately
10 or 15 minutes after the man and woman and he thought SIRHAN
was driving a light colored car, make and model unknown, although
it sticks in his mind that the middle letter on the license plate
was the letter W.

- 167 -

TA 56-156

BUCKNER stated that he was certain that the photo-
graph of SIRHAN was the same individual who was firing at the
range on June 4, 1968. He stated that he was reasonably certain
that he would recognize the blonde woman if he were to see her
again, however, he did not think that he could recognize the
man with the woman. BUCKNER stated that he would be willing to
help the FBI in any way possible in this investigation and in
the event that he should think of anything that might be of
assistance he would immediately contact the Los Angeles Office.

BUCKNER pointed out that he has never been satisfied
that only one person assassinated President JOHN F, KENNEDY in
Dallas, and it is his definite opinion that a conspiracy existed
in that assassination. He stated from what he can gather from
the news media, from the very beginning he believed that a
conspiracy existed to assassinate Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.
BUCKNER stated he could furnish no information to support the
feeling he had from the moment he received news of the shooting
of the Senator that this was a conspiracy other than the information
he furnished concerning the events that took place at the San
Gabriel Valley Gun Club on June 4, 1968.

“Date 6/12/68

EVERETT?! C; BUCKNER, 129 East Bennett Street, Glendora,
California, was interviewed at the San Gabriel Gun Club, 4001
Fish Canyon Road, Duarte, where he is presently employed in the
capacity of a line officer.

Mr, BUCKNER stated he was working on the morning of
June 4, 1968, in the area of the target shed, when an individual
came to the shed and purchased a pistol target. He advised he is
responsible for the sale of targets and ammunition, and said he
told this man to gign the non-member register, which was done,
and that this individual, after obtaining his target, then proceeded
to the vicinity of position number 1 or 3 at the extreme end of
the pistol range. He said he could not definitely pinpoint the
time of day, but estimated that it was sometime after 10:00 a.m.
He said he did not, at this time, observe this individual firing
the pistol, but knew that firing was taking place from the noise
at that end of the range. He could not recall whether there were
any other shooters on the pistol range at this particular time.

He said sometime thereafter, possibly 30 minutes or so,
a couple approached the target shed and the man told him he desired
a target for the rifle range, and that the girl wanted to shoot
a pistol. He said he told this man that it would be necessary
for them to separate, inasmuch as rifle firing is not permitted
on the pistol range, and the male then obtained his target and
started to walk toward the rifle range. He said at this point
he made the comment to the man, "Arn't you going to help your
wife set up her target?" He said thie man replied to this comment
rather angrily, "She's not my God damn wife." At this time the
man then proceeded alone toward the rifle range area.

BUCKNER said he then took the pistol target for the girl
and started walking toward the pistol range, at which time the
girl made a comment to him to the effect, "This is the first time
T have shot this gun, but I have to shoot it today." BUCKNER said he

told the girl that it was against the Gun Club's rules for him

to assist her in any way with the gun, loading or anything else,
but that he would, on his own, help her in setting up her target.
He said that they went to a position near the end of the pistol
range, which would be position number 22 or 23, and he thereafter
set up the girl's target at the 15 yard line. He said after
returning to the line he watched the girl firefor a short period
of time, and noted that she was a very bad shot, inasmuch as she
was not even hitting the target. He said during this period of
time the man who had come earlier was at the extreme other end

of the range firing hie pistol, although BUCKNER paid little-or no
attention to hin.

He said he returned to the target shed and a short time
thereafter the man who had come earlier came to the shed and
asked him if he sold ammunition. He said he replied in the
affirmative, at which time this individual said to him, "I want
something that won't misfire." He said he told this man that he
had the regular .22 shells, which this man was firing, for sale
at $.85 a box, but that he also had a more expensive shell, which
he believed sold for $1.40. He said he told this man he had
never seen any of the expensive shells nisfire, and that at this
time, the man said he wanted a box of this shell. He said he
then sold a box of the expensive shells to the man, at which time
the man then returned to his firing position.

BUCKNER exhibited a box of .22 long high velocity rifle
shells, Imperial brand, which bore the stamped letter "D" on the
base, which he said he was quite certain was the same kind of
ehell he sold to this man. It was noted that the price of $1.05
was marked on the box of this particular shell.

Following this incident, the time not being noted e

h
walked to the pigtol range to see how the girl was doing with her
shooting. He said he was approximately two to three feet from

her at this time, and at thie point the man, referred to previously,
walked up to him with his target in hie hand and said to hin,

"How's this for shooting?" He said he observed the target of

this man, and noted that all shots were in the bulls-eye area.

He said he told this man that this was very good shooting and

was, in fact, the best shooting he had seen on this range. He

said the man was quite elated over his fine pistol shooting and
seened to be very happy.

Immediately following this conversation, he said this
man then walked over to the girl, who was having difficulty with
her shooting, and made some type of remark to her to the effect
that he would show her how to do it. He said the girl then
commented to thig man, "God damn you, you son of a bitch, get
out of here or they will recognize us." He said this man did not
leave and continued to show her how to shoot the gun. He said
he did not overhear any further conversation and did not know
whether there hail been any further conversation,

Following this he said he did not observe this man
again and assumed that he must have left.

Sometime thereafter the man with whom the girl had
come and who had shot the: riflé; came to the pistol range area
and the girl, rather jubilantly, showed him her target, which
had one hole in the bulls-eye. He said the man then made some
kind of comment to the girl to the effect she had fool's luck.
He said he overheard no further conversation and following this
he assumed that the man and woman.left, although he did not see
them leave the range. : ‘

Mr, BUCKNER said he did not observe the gun fired by
this girl very closely, but said he believed it was a .22, that
it was a small gun, and it was his recollection that it had a
pearl handle.

With respect to the rifle shot by the man, BUCKNER said
that the rifle had been brought by this man, but he stated he
could not recall anything about it, as to whether it was in a case
or not. He said in all probability it had been in a case, but he
could not state this as a fact.

Mr. BUCKNER was exhibited a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN,
LAPD #BK 495139, and after viewing this photograph positively
identified this photo as being of the man who had come to the range
earlier on June i, 1968, who had shot at the extreme end of the
pistol range, at position one or three, who had purchased a box of
ammunition from him, and who had had conversation with the girl.

With respect to the girl he said he had never seen her
at the range before, but noted he had only worked at the range
for approximately two weeks previous to this time. He described
this girl as white; 25-30 years: 5'6" - 5'8" tall; 135 pounds;
blonde hair, worn shoulder length; rather husky build; attractive,
and wore very little make-up.

He described the male accompanying this girl as white:
30 years; 5'!10" - 6'; 175-180 pounds; long hair and rather slight
in build.

He said it was his recollection that the man accompanying
the girl had purchased both targets and that while it was a
regulation that anyone firing had to sign the register, he did
not believe that this man had signed the register.

He stated he felt that should he see this girl again
in person that he would be able to recognize her, and that if
anything further came to his mind concerning this incident he
would immediately notify the FBI.

WILLIAM ATALIC, 903 Holley Avenue, Arcadia, California,
was interviewed at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, floor Fish

Mr. ATALIC was queried as to any recollections he had
concerning the day of June 4, 1968, which was the day immediately
preceding the shooting of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

He said that on this particular day he had been working
in the morning near the target shed putting in a new curbing and
as the job was rather complicated, paid very little attention to
any people at the range. He stated, however, that he recalls
seeing a young man at the range whom he assumed had been target
shooting, but said he paid little attention to him, as he had no
reason to watch his movements.

He said after watching television following the shooting
of Senator KENNEDY he observed an individual, identified by the
name of SIRHAN SIRHAN as the person who had probably shot Senator
KENNEDY, and after viewing this person said he felt sure that
this was the same man he had seen at the range on the morning of
June 4, 1968, mentioned above. He stated, however, he could not
state this for a fact.

Mr. ATALIC was also queried as to whether he had observed
any females at the range on June 4, 1968, at which time he stated
it was his vague recollection that a girl had been at the range

sometime during this day, but stated he could not be certain of this,

as he had paid no attention to anything going on about him.

Mr. ATALIC advised he could recall nothing further
about the events of June 4, 1968, but that should he recall any

HARRY HICKS, 4:29 East Foothill, Monrovia, California,

Mr. HICKS was queried as to any recollections he might
have concerning the events at the range on June 44, 1958, this
being the day immediately preceding the shooting of Senator ROBERT
F, KENNEDY.

Mr. HICKS advised that on this particular day he was
working at the extreme further end of the rifle range painting,
renoving poles, and doing other odd jobs, and noted that in the
area where he wags working there was little or no activity.

He said, however, that he recalled that sometime in the
late morning of this day he noted, at a distance, a man and woman,
and observed this woman appeared to be quite shapely.

He said he believed he made a comment to one of the other workers,
whom he could not now identify, to the effect that it would
probably be better to have this man set up the targets and then
for firing to commence while he was placing the targets. He

said he made this comment in jest, thought nothing further of it,
and following this resumed his working.

He said he did not observe this couple either arriving

John Muir High School in Pasadéna, from 1960 to 1966.
stated that he had been counselor to SIRHAN BISHARA STRBAN
during SIRHAN's junior and senior years, this being September
1961 to June 1963. ALLEN advised that when SIRHAN's identity
was made public, ALLEN had reviewed some old records he main-
tained to see if he had counseled SIRHAN. ALLEN advised that
SIRHAN was not the kind of student who frequented his office
as either a very good student or a very bad student. ALLEN
advised that he remembered SIRHAN because of SIRHAN's in-
sistence upon taking basic courses in high school with —
no industrial or business courses in his schedule. ALLEN
stated that he had advised SIRHAN to take one easier course each
semester so SIRHAN could get better grades, but that SIRHAN had
remained insistent on taxing basic education courses. ALLEN
advised that SIRHAN had a language problem in school which .
hindered him on testing, and that SIRHAN's test scores did not
reflect his ability.

ALLEN stated that he did not recall any conversations
with SIRHAN which might have reflected SIRHAN's political
beliefs or about his family background. ALLEN advised that he
could only recall the context of one conversation and that was
in regard to SIRHAN's first and last name being the same. ALLEN
advised that SIRHAN never discussed anything of a personal nature
and that all counseling sessions were academically oriented.

ALLEN furnished a form which he called a "Senior Data
Sheet." ALLEN advised that this form had been furnished to
SIRHAN to list interests, school activities, honors, positions
held and any other noteworthy high school accomplishments.

‘a particular student. ALLEN advised that SIRHAN's record

shows that he did not participate in any high school extra-
curricular activities. ALLEN further advised that it was not
uncommon that an academically average student would not participate
in any activities. ALLEN further advised that he was the sponsor
for numerous activities at John Muir High School and that he

could not recall SIRHAN at any function, social or otherwise,

or participating in any class project. ALLEN advised that

SIRHAN was definitely not a class leader.

ALLEN advised that his record shows that SIRHAN
received several deficiency notices, which are a note to the
student's parents that the student is doing below "C" average
work in a particular course. ALLEN advised that according to
his record and the high school transcription, SIRHAN usually
was able to do at least "C" average work, which indicated to him
that SIRHAN had not been a Tazy student and could respond to
suggestion.

ALLEN advised that SIRHAN had taken the California
Cadet Corps course all three years in high school. ALLEN
advised that this was almost identical to the high school Reserve
Officers' Training Corps sponsored by the Federal Government,
also known as ROTC. ALLEN advised that the California Cadet
Corps is sponsored by the State of California at the John Muir
High School to provide the same type of curriculum as Pasadena
High School, which has an ROTC program. ALLEN advised that the
California Cadet Corps is a military science course, which
would include military history, drill and some rifle range
practice. ALLEN advised that Major MARCUS L. YOUNG, who teaches
the course at John Muir High School could provide more detailed
information and may have roll books reflecting SIRHAN's attendance.
ALLEN advised that Major YOUNG is commissioned by the California
Cadet Corps and did not know exactly what military standing his
rank of Major possessed.

JOHN HENRY STRATHMANN, 2800 Monterey Road,
San Marino, California, telephone number 799-1057, a
Language Instructor at Southwest Military Academy, same
address, advised that he became acquainted with SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN while students together at Pasadena City
College (PCC) in 1964. Both . were linguists, consequently,
their association became quite close. They did not have any
classes together, however, they were frequent associates
and, after leaving PCC, SIRHAN was a frequent guest at the
residence of STRATHMANN and his wife.

SIRHAN was considered an ideal guest and initially
seemed lonely and quiet and was considered very kind and
considerate.

SITRHAN was considered by STRATHMANN to be quite
passive politically and did not tend to discuss American
politics. SIRHAN did, on one occasion, express admiration
for ADOLF HITLER and, although he disapproved of his tactics,
did greatly admire him in the success that he achieved.
SIRHAN criticized the United States because of existing
poverty and the difficulty in achieving rapid advancement,
SIRHAN seemed to be obsessed with a desire to achieve
instant wealth and success. SIRHAN was very emotional in
discussing the recent Arab - Israeli conflict and was
critical of United States policy supporting Israel. SIRHAN
did not discuss personalities in connection with United
States politics. STRATHMANN recalled that on one occasion,
a Jewish friend of his, not known to SIRHAN, expressed to
him a disapproval of the Israeli treatment of Arab refugees.
This STRATHMANN related to SIRHAN and SIRHAN understood him
to say that his friend admired the Israeli treatment of
Arab refugees, and SIRHAN, in an emotional outburst, stated,
"He had better not say that to me".

After SIRHAN fell from a horse in 1966, he seemed
to change considerably. His eyes appeared to be different
to the effect that he had difficulty seeing out of one eye

and it seemed glassy and bloodshot. SIRHAN rubbed it
frequently and since the accident seemed very impatient,
nervous, more emotional, and always in a hurry.

After the accident, SIRHAN also became interested
in mystical bodies, the power of mind over others. SIRHAN
had indicated that he was studying mysticism with an
individual named PAUL, who was unknown to STRATHMANN, STRHAN
gave STRATHMANN a book on mysticism, which he has misplaced.

Prior to the accident, STRATHMANN considered
SIRHAN a very intense person and a perfectionist and,
subsequent to the accident, SIRHAN seemed to have lost an
intensity which had been characteristic of him previously.

STRATHMANN, about six months ago, gave SIRHAN a
text book on Chinese grammay inwhich SIRHAN had expressed an
interest. He does not believe that SIRHAN studied the book
and did not return it to STRATHMANN,

STRATHMANN's last conversation with SIRHAN was in
mid April 1968.

he does not know him well, but that they talked some with
each other and learned they are both from the same town in
Palestine. They did not know each other in Palestine. He
advised that he knows SIRHAN's brother, SHARIF, better than
SIRHAN.

SOLAMEH stated he does not believe that SIRHAN
is part of any conspiracy, that he probably was motivated
"from his own head". SOLAMEH denies there is any Arab group
that he is aware of that would have sponsored any attack
such as the one on Senator KENNEDY. SOLAMEH stated he has not
geen SIRHAN since 1953, but does hear of him often, is aware of
SIRHAN's continued residence in Pasadena, knew about SIRHAN's
horse racing jobs, and has heard that STRHAN ask*s about him

that he now realized that he had seen him on several occasions
at PCC. He noted, however, that he has never known him
by name, has never associated with him, and has never had

that MISTRI also attended PCC and recalled that he and MISTRI
saw SIRHAN by chance at the races. He pointed out, however,
that although they recognized SIRHAN by sight and had a
conversation with him, the conversation was solely about the
races and nothing more. DORDI noted that he believes this

recall how SIRHAN came to him, but that during this
period he was using young boys in connection with his
gardening work and SIRHAN did come to him for such
employment. During the ‘next three years, SIRHAN worked
for him on a part-time basis, as work was available, and
as SIRHAN wanted work. During the first part of this
period, it was BEVERIDGE's understanding that SIRHAN was
attending Muir High School in Pasadena, and was living with
his mother at some address on East Howard Street. He
subsequently left Muir High School and did some studying
at Pasadena High School located on Sierra Madre Boulevard.
It was BEVERIDGE's belief that this was high school study
rather than on a college level.

BEVERIDGE advised that it was his understanding
that SIRHAN's father had originally been in this country,
put had returned to Palestine by himsélf. SIRHAN's mother
stayed in this country, and in addition he had two brothers
and possibly one sister in this country. One brother was
a painter by the name of JOE. The other brother was a musician;
however, BEVERIDGE did not know his name. It was also his
impression that the sister may have died sometime during the
time he knew SIRHAN.

In about 1963, SIRHAN had some type of difficulty
with his family. It was BEVERIDGE's impression that this
arose from a fight between SIRHAN and his brother, JOH, which

_ resulted in the Pasadena Police Department being called because

of the disturbance. Because of this fight, SIRHAN left his
family's residence and lived for several weeks in a camper
owned by BEVERIDGE and parked at his residence. After BEVERIDGE
found out that it was illegal to have someone stay in the
camper, SIRHAN moved to a house owned by BEVERIDGE at 234 North
Carmello, Pasadena. BEVERIDGE was in the process of renovating

this house and SIRHAN stayed there by himself. This house
has subsequently been torn down.

In early 1964, SIRHAN started work at the gas
station located at the intersection of Foothill and Altadena
Drive. BEVERIDGH last saw him during the period he was working
at this gas station and estimated that this would have been
three to four years ago.

BEVERIDGE advised that he does not have any infor-
mation concerning any associates of SIRHAN other than he was .
friendly with one of the employees of the above service station
who left this area to enter military service.

BEVERIDGE described STRHAN as a quiet boy, who
talked very little about his past or his family. He was
quiet, well mannered, and studied very hard. He did not
discuss politics and did not in any way express resentment
toward any individual or any group. He appeared to like
the United States and enjoyed living in this country. At
no time did he display any temperament or show violence.

WAYNE J. BRANTLEY, 319 South Violet Street, Apart-
ment E, Monrovia, California, advised that he is employed by the
Bertea Corporation, Irvine Ranch, California.

BRANTLEY stated that he was acquainted with SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN for approximately a six month period in 1963,
during which time they became close friends. At that time,
BRANTLEY was 1/7 years old and was employed at the service
station located at the intersection of Foothill and Altadena
Drive, owned by CLARENCE COPPING. BRANTLEY worked during
the late evening and early morning hours at this station.
Sometime during the middle of 1963, possibly in June or
July, COPPING introduced him to SIRHAN., BRANTLEY stated
that he does not know how COPPING and SIRHAN became
acquainted, or what connection they have with each other.
At the time this occurred, it was BRANTLEY's understanding
that SIRHAN was attending Pasadena City College, and was
doing part-time evening work at Peak's Hamburger House
(now known as Taco Treat), located near the intersection
of Halstead and Foothill Boulevard in Pasadena. It was
BRANTLEY's belief that at this time SIRHAN was probably
about 19 years old. From the time that he met him, until
the time that BRANTLEY left the service station in December
1963, to enter the Armed Services, STRHAN made it a practice
to come to the service station and stay with BRANTLEY for
several hours each evening.

BRANTLEY stated that he left the service station
in December 1963, and did not return to the California area
until December 1966. At that time, he asked COPPING if he
knew where SIRHAN was, and COPPING stated that he did not
know what SIRHAN was doing but had heard that he had gotten
a job at the Santa Anita Race Track as a jockey or horse
trainer. BRANTLEY made no other effort to contact SIRHAN
and consequently has not seen him or heard from him since
December 1963.

BRANTLEY stated that during the period he knew
SIRHAN, SIRHAN was living in a camper located at the

residence of Mr. BEVERIDGE, on North Sierra Madre Boulevard.
SIRHAN indicated that he was living apart from his family
because of some family trouble, but he did not discuss this
any further.

BRANTLEY stated that he did not meet any of the
SIRHAN family, but recalls SIRHAN talking about his parents
so he assumed that both his father and mother were living in
this area. He also made passing reference to a brother by
the name of JOH; however, BRANTLEY did not recail anything
specifically said about JOE, There was no reference made
about SIRHAN having a sister. SIRHAN did talk about an
uncle who still lived in dvygalem. In this connection,
BRANTLEY stated that SIRHAN told him that he came to this
country with his family from jepusalem several years ago.
He claimed to be Arabian, but did not make reference to
any Arabic nationality.

BRANTLEY advised that he considered SIRHAN to be
a very intelligent individual. He spoke English with a
slight accent and indicated a knowledge of Arabic. He also
could at least read German, since on one occasion he

_ interpreted a letter written in German which BRANTLEY's

brother had received from a girl friend in Germany.

BRANTLEY stated that throughout his contact with
SIRHAN, they did not discuss politics or involvement of this
country in other parts of the world. Their topics of
conversation were limited to normal interests of young
teenagers, including talk about girls; however, at no
time did SIRHAN indicate that he had a particular girl
friend. SIRHAN did not indicate any emotional disturbance
over the situation in Israel, and no particular animosity
toward any individual or group. When he did talk about
Jeuselem, it was related to graphic description of the
physical lay out of the country and the customs of the
people. SIRHAN appeared to be very satisfied with his
life in this country and appreciative of the manner of
living and his acceptance in this country.

BRANTLEY stated that he has seen recent pictures
of SIRHAN. The only difference noticed was that during
the period BRANTLEY knew SIRHAN, he wore a thick, dark
mustache,

BRANTLEY stated that he cannot suggest anyone
else who would have further knowledge of SIRHAN, adding .
that he did not meet any of SIRHAN's friends or introduce”
him to anyone to whom SIRHAN became friendly.
