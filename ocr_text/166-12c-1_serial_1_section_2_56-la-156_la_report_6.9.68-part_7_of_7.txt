STRHAN; What?

ANOTHER OFFICER: GENE.

SIRHAN: Oh, GENE.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, I'm really not sure of the correct
pronunciation, it's JEN BROZ is the way, the way it was
indicated. Like I say, that I not sure of. As far as the
venicle now, we're little more firm ground. I mean I am.
Possible.

STRHAN: What was that?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Probably somebody they brought in, that's
unhappy. Somebody wants to get the soapy offof him. They
apparently just gave him a shower and maybe they cut the
water off before the soap.

SIRHAN: Good, that's humanitarianism.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well, we try to give them a show,
there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

SIRHAN: They shut the water on me.
ANOTHER OFFICER: Huh?

SIRHAN: They shut the water off on me.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You mean they shut it off before.
SIRHAN: Wo, no, I was completely washed.
ANOTHER OFFICER, Oh. Well, I think that is what he was

complaining about. That they shut the water off before he
had the soap off.

SIRHAN: Oh, oh. That is really irritating. At least I would

think so.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well, I, when I was in the Pacific in

World War II, whenever it rained, we didn't have any fresh
water so whenever it rained we rushed out and get lathered up
and try to. A lot of times you'd get all lathered up and the
ship would run out of the storm. So there you are, stuck with
all the soap. Then you have to get down, get the salt water
and wash it off. Very bad. You travel? Have you traveled
much? Little momento, little souvenir from my younger days.

SIRHAN: On, not from the fifteen years.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Oh no, oh no, Service to God and country
or whatever you want to call it. Mom's old apvle pie and
all that.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You travel much? Or have you?

SIRHAN: If I had the need.

ANOTHER OFFICER: No, I didn't say would you. I said have
you traveled much. No, I don't think, if you do of course,

you're the.......

SIRHAN: I like to travel. I watch all kinds of travel
programs.

ANOTHER OFFICER: You tell me you, you've never had much
opportunity yourself, or would you rather not tell me? Like
I said. If I get into an area you don't want to talk about.

STRHAN: Really, it is not that.....Really I don't think
travel, if I had the money I'd love to travel, If I don't
have it naturally you can't do it. Really, what do you think?
Have you traveled?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Some. But usually with Uncle Sam paying

the expenses. That isn't the most luxurious way to travel and
you don't get to pick your destination, so, I have traveled

a little bit within the country. I have been to Mexico a

few times, and that's about it. Saw a lot of islands. They're
not as romantic as I was led to believe. But now there are

SOME weovvee

ANOTHER OFFICER: Yeah. But there are some real nice. There
are some that I would like,to go back.

SIRHAN: Now if you go to Hawaii?

ANOTHER OFFICER: Not Hawaii. I bet Hawaii by now is so
commercialized.

SIRHAN: That's what I was going to say.

ANOTHER OFFICER: That they have ruined what charm it has,
but the other islands down south or up in central Pacific,
those are pretty.

SIRHAN: I wish I was there.

ANOTHER OFFICER: We'd probably both be happier if we were
there, Could I ask you where you were born?

SIRHAN: In the world.

ANOTHER OFFICER; Well, okay. Now you can just tell me if
you would rather not answer, you can just tell me that. I'm
not, I mean, understand I am trying to pry but I won't if
you say no, that's as far as I will go. So are you telling
me you're not going to tell me, or you'd rather not discuss
it, or do you want to play twenty questions?

SIRHAN: What's that? Is that a new game?

ANOTHER OFFICER: No that's an old game. That's an old game.
STRHAN: Old trick, huh?

ANOTHER OFFICER: No.

SIRHAN: How does it go?

ANOTHER OFFICER: It's not a trick, really. It's kind of a

ANOTHER OFFICER: Censoring?

ANOTHER OFFICER: No. If you edit it at all, it loosés what
ever limited value it would have.

SIRHAN: It is, is any of what I am saying, would be used
against me in court?

nature, it could be used against you in court, certainly.

thing you say of an incriminating nature could be used against
you in court.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Well we, we want you to understand that
pefore you, you and in your case it was easy because you grasp
things very easily. Sometimes I have a hard time, cause I
really, I feel that these people should understand before

they talk.

SIRHAN: I hear you send them to the slaughter, no?

ANOTHER OFPICER: No. No, I don't feel that way. Do you
think I send people to the slaughter? I mean...

SIRHAN: Standard type, you know, generally this is stereo-
type. Every average berson regards and has an attitude.

ANOTHER OFFICER: Yeah. Well, I disagree because naturally
Iam prejudice in my own favor, both as a human being and as
a law enforcement officer. I mean I would much rather feel
that I serve people, not that I persecute people. I know you
think possibly that Mr. MURPHY and I were putting you ona
little bit when we said that, but it gives you a nice feeling
to some guy that looks real bad. know you are skeptical.

SIRHAN: How do you mean?

ANOTHER OFFICER: You look like you are skeptical, but to
clear some guy that looks real bad, everything looks....this
guy's dead, nobody believes him, even his family say I don't
know how any son of mine could have done such a thing, and
they start digging around and you come up with stuff and you
show that the guy didn't do it. That's a, that's a nice feeling.
That's a reward that nobody can appreciate except you and if
you don't appreciate it, you're missing a lot of this. I'm
not getting through to you. But I mean it very sincerely.
It's not all that way. Let's facé it. We're like any other
group. Everybody has a different outlook and attitude on the
job. Some guys want to cut corners, some guys have to do
everything out of the book, and I think no matter what field
you go into, judges, doctors, different kinds of people. Lots
of safe ground there. I think yau can go along'with that.

Why did you decide to become a cop?

Oh I den't know I've always kind of been interested
in law enforcement. I have a really good friend
back home that was a State Trooper Highway Patrolman
and he kind of got me interested into it. And then
I just felt that that was my way or my little bit of
helping society a little bit.

(Unintelligible)

I should have continued on being a farmer or rancher.
That's what my dad is, a rancher.

Oh boye
Still a rancher. Good life.
Beautiful, outdoor life.

Well I think personally, if you were to have that type
of society, and people were going abide by it, to live
by it, they would have to, in my opinion be, someone
with really much, of, ah, hardly any goals, you know,
he didn't really care he just does what he is told to
do and he really, he does his little job whether it's

there is a barrier there. Because maybe the policeman

attitude. I entertain a different attitude
toward this business because really the thoughts

there is no factual, there is no facts directly
say this is wrong, this is right, and you know
everything is what you think, it is, no?

you says, you want to hang a man, and you
don't want to hang a man, and this and that.

ask you.

Listen there are a lot of people that spend
