3 Others Wounded

From News Dispatches ~ .

LOS ANGELES, June 5 (Wednesday)—Robert Fr.
Kennedy, brother of the assassinated President John
F. Kennedy, was shot early today minutes after he
claimed his victory in the California primary.

He was pronounced in critical condition at Central
Receiving Hospital from three wounds—two in the ~
head and one in the hip.

At 4 a.m. (EDT) he was given the last rites of the
Roman Catholic Church. Later Kennedy was trans-
ferred to Good Samaritan Hospital.

The shooting at the Ambassador Hotel turned the
Kennedy victory celebration into a scene of horror and
pandemonium.

Kennedy was reportedly conscious and. talking ‘after
being struck by the series of shots. Almost immediately
after the shooting a young man of Latin appearance in
dungarees was seen being taken into custody.

The shots were fired about 3:20 a.m. EDT. At least,
three other men were.reported wounded, Paul Schrade
of the Steelworkers Union, ABC unit manager William
Wiesel and Irwin Stroli, 17, of Los Angeles.

Priest Offers a Rosary

A priest, near the scene of the shooting, said he ap-

proached the fallen Senator, “I gavé him the rosary and

he clenched it tightly and I was pushed away. There was
blood on his head.”

Kennedy's wife, Ethel, expecting her 11th child, knelt

by her husband before hé was taken'to the hospital. Her
fate was, tasked with shock.

The California victor had just left the ballroom of the !

Ambassaflor and was walking along a service corridor
outside qhe kitchen. There was a normal erush bf re:
porters, photographers and spectators.

At least five shots were fired, according to eyewit-

nesses, by a man who had been standing by a service

cart.

A bus boy reported that Kennedy gasped at one
point. “Is everybody okay? Is everybody okay?”

After he was struck, ee lay ina pool of blood

Ram tackle Roosevelt Grier, both of whom had been .

campaigning with Kennedy, reportedly seized the
assailant, An accomplice was Teportedly also taken into
custody.

Joe La Hive, a member of Kennedy's headquarters
staff, said he and another aide participated in the
capture.

“We both looked at Bobby and then we both grabbed
the gunman and threw him up on a table. The guy
grabbed his gun and handed it to Rafer Johnson and:
we turned the guy over to police,” said La Hive.

David Jayne, an ABC producer ‘in Los Angeles, said he
“heard several Joud noises like popping firecrackers” and
he dived to the ground. When he looked up Kennedy
had fallen in front of him.

Emergency Treatment
One physician on the scene was quoted as ‘saying
that the Senator was going to be all right. But Kennedy
was reported to be unconscious at the Central Re-
ceiving Hospital, where last rites were administered.

The assailant was described as an olive-skinned man
of about 25. One witness said that he heard the gunman
“shout something about saving the country.”

There was an interval of about 60 seconds between.
the first shot and the later burst of gunfire. It was the
ensuing flurry that finally awakened the victory cele
brants to what had happened.

Emergency treatment was given. to Kennedy at the
Central Receiving Hospital, where doctors administered
shots and intravenous fluid. It was while he was there
that Father Thomas Teacha from St. Basil’s Church was
called in to administer the last rites.

Less than a half hour later the New York Senate
was taken to Good Samaritan for surgery. Kennedy
press aide Frank Mankiewicz described the Senator
as in “stable condition” there.

“He was breathing well. He had & good heart beat; od
the aide said.

The shooting and ensuing bedlam was reported on
live television. It was an irony reminiscent of the
murder of his brother’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.’
The scene on the screen registered the same atmosphere
of hysteria, disarray and mute shock.

There were cries of “Kill him! Lynch him!” as some
in the crowd tried to grapple for the assailant. Kennedy's
bodyguard, William Barry, and Grier shielded the sus
pect from the crowd.

The news of the shooting spread. quickly through
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy’s election headquarters at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel and threw. a pall over a notsy
crowd there.

McCarthy was awakeried and’ went immediately ‘to
the ballroom of his hotel. He asked that, the crowd
there join him in a ‘moment of silent prayer.

President Johnson was advised of the shooting im-

mediately, but the White House withheld comment. A
spokesman for Gov. Ronald Reagan said the California
Chief Executive deplored the shooting and offered

“whatever assistance that we can make available” to
help apprehend the assailants.

The Senator’s brother, Sen. Edward M. Ki nned
telephoned the family ‘tome: i

By DON MacLEAN

For Jeane Dixon, the famous Washington
seeress, the assassination of Sen. Reberi F.
Kennedy (D., N.Y.) in Los Angeles, Calif.,
was a ghasily repetition of the events
leading up to the assassination of Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, in Dallas, Tex.

According to a number of witnesses, Mrs.
Dixon, as long ago as last January, pre-
dicted that there would be “a planned at-
tempt” on Robert Kennedy’s life.

She told this to businessmen in Nashville,
Tenn., last January; to her Imcheon part-
ner, also in Nshville; ta Alex Bilanow,
Real Estale Editor of The Washington
Daily News; and to former Rep. Frank
Boykins (D., Ala.}.

In her 1968 forecasis for Newsday Inc.,
she saw “a. dark cloud” over Sen. Kenne-
dy; In an interview with the Evening Star
newspaper here, she predicted that Sen.
Kennedy might have “a great — and
planned — accident.”

Mrs. Dixon, whose column .of ferecasis
and horescope readings appears here ex-
clusively in The Washington Daily News,
is the wife of local real estate broker
James L: Dixon. Since she arrived in
Washington, during World War 1, Mrs.
Dixon has made some uncannily accurate
predictions, .many of which are docu-
snented in the best-selling book, “Gift of
Prophecy,” written by Ruth Montgomery.

The iction for which she is most
widely known involved the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, As early as
1956, she said-on radio and TV interviews
that she saw ‘a blue-eyed young man, a
Democrat, as President, and a dark cloud
hovering over the White House.”

After Mr. Kennedy was elected, she told
numerous friends that she had bad a “‘pre-
sentiment” that he would be assassinated.
“At the time,’ Mrs. Dixon said, “all‘of my
friends urged me to siop saying things like
that, Bui i told them he should be
warned.”

On several occasions, shorily before JeK
lefi for Dallas, Mrs. Dixon tried to get mu-
tual friends fo beg him not to go. Just
before noon, on Nov, 22, 1963, Mrs. Dixon
was lenching with ihree friends at the
Mayflower Hotet here.

“All at onee, it came fo me,” Mrs. Dixon
being shot!’ My friends urged me to be

orchesira leader leaned over to talk to an
exciied waiter. Then Sidney stepped the
music amd said, 'The President has’ been
shot.’ One of my friends said, ‘Oh, I hope
he’s only wounded.’ J said, ‘No, I'm afraid
he's dead.”

The prediction about Robert Kennedy
wag along similar lines. While speaking be-
fore a group of sales executives in
Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 9, 1968, Mrs. Dix-
on said a vision revealed {o her that Robert
Kennedy would be in physical danger soon.

‘WILL BE SHOT’

Later that day, according te a copyrighi- -
ed story in the Nashville Banner, Jeane
Dixon told her lunchean companion, a
prominent Nashville businessman, that
“Bobby Kennedy will be shot."

Her January column of predictions for
Newsday Inc., carried the following para-

his brother’s assassination —- this’ event
still hangs over him. Il seems as tho the

Also in January, the Evening Star, in an

interview, quoted Jeane Dixon as saying
this: ‘I see a great burst around Sen. Ken-
nedy. This could mean a great tragic —
and planned — accident.”

Last September, Alex Bilanow inter-
viewed Mrs. Dixon fer a story regarding
the real estate interests of both Mrs. Dixon
and her husband.

“We were sitting in a restaurant,’ Mr.
“when Mrs. Dixon said,

“T said, ‘What de you mean, Jeane, a

plane crash or an automobile accident?’
She said, "No, much worse. He's going to
be shot.””
