“Ligh

by MARGE FERRIS |

According to Matcolm.:
Wells, a prominent environ- -
mentalist, automobile
fumes, industrial waste and
sewage aren’t the only types
of pollution plaguing modern:
society.

There is now a new and
possibly much more-danger-
ous kind to add to the list — .
light pollution!

‘Bad things happen at night — |

criminals become. more active,

_ automobile accidents crease, ,|'
= chickens lay fewer eggs.

Because of these and other
night-related: problems, modém
_society, seems heJl-bent on
doing away with darkness.’

Night, in fact, is being legislated

out of existence, says. Wells.
“Brilliant ‘crime lights’ are
sprouting on downtown streets...
‘Mercury-vapor bulbs glow over
freeways, parking lots, bridges |
= playing 1 fields. Even homes

— like modern poultry houses
— are lit-all through the night
for the ‘welfare’ of their inhabi-

| tants. We have become neurotic

about night,’’ claims Wells.
We may also be unwittingly
doing away with a valuable
natural resource, the scientist
adds. Night and darkness are

‘part of man’s environmental

heritage. The natural day, to
which our bodies have been
tuned, operates not by the clock
but by the cycle of light and
darkness.. And this cycle is
extremely important to health
and happiness.

But soon darkness may be
almost wnavailable-to urban
ipeople — éxcept in private
‘rooms or -lightproof compart-
‘ments — ‘‘even though soft,
restful darkness isa perfect set-

ting for the deep rest that all day-
time creatures require.”’

“We're losing all that,’’ Wells
warns. “Going, going, gone is
the wonderful, private feeling of
being outdoors in safety on a
dark night.

“Kiss the stars good-by,”’ the.
environmentalist says, refer-
ring to the tremendous light spill
from our overilluminated cities.

Observatories have felt the
light spill problem for years.
Light creeping up from Los
Angeles has spoiled the view
from Mount Wilson and put the
observatory there just about
out of business. Although the

Mount Palomar observatory

| has not yet been ruined, it. is

also being severely affected.
“Any observatory is going to

have trouble,”’ says Charles |

Federer, edifor of Sky and |

Telescope magazine.

. As light

-pollution spreads, even your
average backyard astronomer is

getting hurt.””

Excess light is also having
biological effects.

Young female test animals,
kept under prolonged illumina-
tion, begin menstruating earlier
than animals kept to a standard
light-and-darkness cycle. And
according to N.A. Jafarey, a
Pakistani physician, excess
light causes girls living in indus-

it — lution Is a Threat
To America’s Health

trialized societies to mature
eatlier, —

Scientist John Ott of
Sarasota, Florida, also points
an accusing finger at artificial

) light. His experiments have
| Shown that unnatural, lighting
affects sexual activity. and pro-
ductivity.

Finally, the tremendous,
amount of electricity used to ©

| overlight cities. and homes is
| depleting fuel reserves,
| Malcolm Wells predicts that
someday, perhaps inthe not too
| distant future, strict laws will
“limit: artificial lighting to the
) surfaces that need light, and
prevent light spillage into the
sky or i ‘0 people’s eyes.”

. Dest: vying, night could even-
tually become as serious a
crime, as polluting water or
fouling the air.

the Pasadena, California, commun-
ity:where she lives with two of her
five sons say they feel sorry for her.

“She looks so old and frail,” says
Gabriel Arandia, a 25-year-old
mother of six who lives next'door
fo the Sirhan residence.

_ “She rarely goes out of the house
and sometimes refuses to come to
the door or answer the telephone.

. ‘Sometimes I see Mrs. Sirhan
watering her lawn, but most of the
time she sits in the house,” said Mrs.
Arandia.

Life-has been a series of troubles
for the remaining brothers since
Sirhan assassinated Kennedy. The
five. brothers range in age from 24-

Said, the oldest, is currently fac-
ing a municipal court trial on
charges of disturbing the peace.
The charges were leveled ~ against
him by his mother, ~

Police say he broke a window in:
his mother’s house in July and
threatened to burn the home down
in the belief that Mrs. Sirhan had
been withholding family-funds.

Mrs, Sirhan claims, “Ihave no.
funds and no income other than

.from Munir (her youngest son).””

Said has also been convicted of
LSD and marijuana possession,
and:a public drunkenness.

Dear Bonnie:

President Nixon has referred to this Department
your correspondence postmarked May 13, 1972. We apologize
for our delay in responding.

Sirhan Sirhan was tried, convicted and sentenced
to death, in a California State Court for the first
degree murder of Senator Robert Kennedy. The California
Supreme Court has subsequently declared the death
penalty unconstitutional and Sirhan's sentence was
reduced to life in prison. He is presently serving
his sentence in a California State Penitentiary.

James Earl Ray pled guilty in Tennessee to
charges of first degree murder in the slaying of the
Reverend Martin Luther King. He is presently serving
@ life sentence in a Tennessee State Penitentiary.

Sincerely,
