She has resided at that address for approximately
seven years. She is acquainted with Mrs. MARY SIRHAN

On June 5, 1968, JAMES EDWARD BURN, Associate Pastor,
Community Methodist Church, 918 West Avenue J, Lancaster,
California, telephone number 942-0419, stated he presently
resides at 214 East Nugent, Lancaster, telephone 942-4050.

BURN said he was formerly a Baptist Pastor and
served as Associate Pastor under Pastor CHARLES BELL,
First Baptist Church of Pasadena, 75 North Morengo Avenue,
Pasadena. He resided at 743 East Howard Street, Pasadena,
from about 1960 - 1965, during which time he was acquainted
with the SIRHAN family.

BURN stated to the best of his recollection,
Mrs. MARY SIRHAN and her childxen came to the United States
from Jerusalem in about 1960. The father, name unknown,
remained in Jerusalem as he and MARY apparently had marital
problems. BURN said the only sons he can recall were named
SAIDALLAH, SHARI¥,. and the younger son SIRHAN. He said he
believes there was a daughter who came to the United States
with them but he is not certain of her name. It may have
been MARY, however, she did not reside with the family in
Pasadena.

BURN said he knew the family through his church,
as the mother was a member and faithful in church attendance.
He also saw them in the neighborhood as the SIRHAN family
resided at 1647 North Lake and later at 696 East Howard,
which was near his own residence.

During the time he knew SIRHAN SIRHAN, he had
Several talks with him regarding belief in God. SIRHAN
appeared to be a very intense atheist and could see no logical
reason to believe in God. BURN stated SIRHAN also attended
John Muir High School, Pasadena, during that period and was
about a sophomore. He appeared to be very close to one of
the high school teachers who furnished him with a great deal
of literature to substantiate his beliefs in atheism. BURN
said he does not know the name of this teacher but recalls
that SIRHAN considered him an authority on almost all subjects

and perhaps associated with him as a substitute for his
father. He said at the time he attempted to communicate
with SIRHAN, he felt SIRHAN was receiving adult orientation,
as many of his arguments were those used by adults.

BURN said the boys all seem to have a bitter
attitude toward life, with the feeling that the world owed
them a living. This was due in part to the resentment they
had for their father who did not come with them to the
United States.

He advised further that he did not recall any of
the boys belonging to any organizations in the community.
STRHAN may have been a member of some club, but it would
have been connected with John Muir High School.

BURN said the mother was employed by the
Westminster Presbyterian Church near their residence. She
worked in child care with the pre-school children. SHARIF™
STRHAN was employed off and on as a painter and he said he
cannot recall where SAIDALLAH was employed.

The STRHAN family were close friends with the
(First name unknown) MOKHTARIAN family who resided near them
on Elizabeth Street in Pasadena. BURN said he believes the
two families were related in some manner.

Dr. CHARLES R. BELL, JR., Pastor of the First
Baptist Church of Pasadena; 75 North Marengo Avenue,
telephone SY 3-7164, home telephone SY 4-4441, was contacted
at the Church where he advised the following:

He recalled the SIRHAN family as having attended
nis church in the early 1960s. He could not recall exactly
when the family started to attend church, but stated that
the mother and three or four of the children then appealed
to the Church to bring two other children to the United
States from their home country. The other two children
were SHARIF and SAIDALLAH SIRHAN. He thought that the
other members of the family had been brought to the United
States by a Seventh Day Adventist group. The family
attended church regularly including various club functions
of the Church, but the family never officially joined the
Church.

BELL got SHARIF SIRHAN an accounting job with the
Soutnern California Baptist Convention in Los Angeles ;
and SHARIF was employed there for over a year when he was
dismissed due to his allegedly placing a bomb in his girl
friend's car. The SIRHAN family felt that Pastor BELL
had SHARIF dismissed from his job when, in fact, BELL had
no connection with the dismissal. He stated he tried to
reason with tne family to no avail and shortly thereafter
the family stooped coming to church.

Of all the members in the SIRHAN family BELL
had the least contact with SIRHAN SIRHAN and believes when
SIRHAN SIRHAN was coming to the Church he was in his mid-teens.
BELL personally believed the entire family was unstable
probably due to the fact that the father more or less cut
all ties with the family and the youngsters had no fatherly
guidance. BELL stated he knew of no present or past member
of the Church who was close to the SIRHAN family and who
could offer any information concerning them.

GAYMOARD MISTRI, 825 East Delmar Street,
Pasadena, California (Phone SY 6-7449), advised that he
came to the United States from Bombay, India, five years
ago. He related that-he attended Pasadena City College
(PCC), Pasadena, Califé%iia, for two years after which he
transferred to the Western State College of Engineering
(WSC) at Inglewood, California. He studied there for two
years and was graduated one week ago with a degree in
Engineering. MISTRI explained that he is presently unemployed
and in the process of seeking a job after obtaining his
degree. He thereafter furnished information as follows:

In 1962 or 1963, MISTRI was attending PCC and
belonged to a social club called the Foreign Students!
Group. This club was for all foreign students on campus.
Through the club, he developed speaking acquaintances with
various other foreign students, one of whom was SIRHAN
SIRHAN, MISTRI explained that their relationship was that
of "casual acquaintances" and noted that he never knew
SIRHAN by name until he was identified through the press as
being the assassin of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY. He pointed
out that their sole relationship was that of speaking to each
other on campus or having coffee where other foreign students
gathered. MISTRI recalled, however, that SIRHAN always
called him "MISTRI."

MISTRI further explained that he continued to
reside in Pasadena while attending WSC and would often eat !
or attend social functions on campus at PCC. On some
occasions, he would see SIRHAN but estimates that in the
last three years he has not seen him over four or five times.

In late March, 1968, MISTRI saw SIRHAN at the
Santa Anita Racetrack, Arcadia, California. They talked
for only a few minutes, and the conversation was mainly
about the races. He recalled that SIRHAN asked about some
mutual acquaintances and asked how MISTRI was doing. He ‘
noted that they talked for only three to five minutes.

On June 4, 1968, at approximately 6:10 p.m.,
MISTRI entered Bob's Big Boy Restaurant, 1616 East Colorado
Boulevard, Pasadena.. The restaurant is adjacent to the
campus at PCC. MISTRI sat at the counter for approximately
ten minutes after which SIRHAN entered the restaurant,
recognized him and joined him at the counter. After
greeting him, STRHAN asked MISTRI to join him for dinner
and stated, "The meal is on me." After MISTRI declined the
offer, SIRHAN took MISTRI's check for coffee. After a few
minutes of non-specific conversation, MISTRI began reading
a newspaper which carried a caption concerning the Israeli-
Jordan situation. SIRHAN noted the caption and said words
to the effect of "things are wrong there." However, MISTRI
did not pursue the conversation, and SIRHAN made no further
comments concerning Israel, Jordan, or any other political
situation or figure. SIRHAN's meal was served, and the
remainder of the conversation was of horse racing, about
which both had a mutual interest.

When SIRHAN finished his meal and paid the checks,
he asked MISTRI where he was going. When MISTRI informed
him that he was going to the PCC campus, SIRHAN stated,

"I think I'11 come with you."

They then walked to the campus cafeteria, during
which time they again talked of horse racing. Upon entering
the cafeteria,  SIRHAN observed four Arab students whom he
immediately approached. He introduced himself and MISTRI,
after which a conversation ensued in Arabic. MISTRI
recognized one of the students to be MOROOF BADRAN (phonetic),
whose address MISTRI furnished from an address book as
5733 Benner Street, Apartment 7, Highland Park, Los Angeles.
He did not recognize the other students. BADRAN and the
other students then departed the cafeteria to attend a 7:00
‘p.m. class, and MISTRI and SIRHAN sat at another table.

MISTRI initially stated that inasmuch as they
had just left the restaurant, he did not care for coffee,
but at SIRHAN's insistence he ordered hot chocolate. A
casual and non-specific conversation then began, during

870

LA 56-156

which time, SIRHAN began toying with a small metal object
which he held in his hands. When MISTRI asked what the
object was, SIRHAN advised that it was something connected
with a gun or bullet. MISTRI explained that SIRHAN told
him what the object was but noted that he cannot now recall
exactly what it was. He noted, however, that he is sure
that it was connected with guns or bullets and stated that
his impression is that it was a spent slug of a bullet which
had been fired from its casing and subsequently recovered.

A detailed interview with MISTRI and an examination
of a .38 caliber bullet failed to clarify exactly what type
of object MISTRI had seen. He concluded, however, that he
feels that it was a spent slug of a smaller caliber than
the .38 caliber bullet displayed for clarification purposes.

After MISTRI inquired about the above mentioned
object, he asked SIRHAN if he was a hunter. SIRHAN replied
that he had hunted on occasion but noted that he was just
learning about the sport. However, MISTRI noted that he
then asked SIRHAN an unrecalled question about rabbit
hunting and pointed out that, judging from the conversation
that followed, he formed the opinion that SIRHAN had little
or no knowledge about hunting or firearms.

Shortly thereafter, they departed the cafeteria
and began walking to a campus parking lot where each had a
car parked. While walking toward the lot, SIRHAN observed
@ new campus building and noted that the new building stands
on what was a vacant lot when they attended PCC. SIRHAN ‘
then, referring to the time when they attended PCC as students,
said words to the effect of, "That was a beautiful time ...
when the political situation was better." MISTRI noted that
he felt that the statement was odd and did not exactly
understand it; however, inasmuch as he did not wish to
continue the conversation, he made no comment and neither
did SIRHAN.

While walking toward the lot, they came to a
newspaper rack, from which MISTRI purchased a Preview
Edition of the "Los Angeles Times.” When SIRHAN stated that
he also wanted a paper, MISTRI told him not to purchase one
inasmuch as he, MISTRI, wanted only the classified ad section
for job hunting purposes. MISTRI then took the classified ad
section and gave the remainder of the paper to SIRHAN. MISTRI
does not recall seeing SIRHAN look at the paper.

871

LA 56-156

As they approached their vehicles in the parking
lot, SIRHAN asked MISTRI if he wanted to shoot pool. After
MISTRI declined, SIRHAN lingered for a few moments talking
about mutual friends. MISTRI recalled that SIRHAN asked
such questions as how former students were getting along
and how many children they now have.

As they entered their respective vehicles, MISTRI
recognized that SIRHAN entered the same vehicle which he
had when they attended PCC. He described the vehicle as
an older model Chrysler product which was pink in color.. °
MISTRI departed the lot first and did not observe the |.
direction in which SIRHAN drove away. MISTRI estimated the time to
be 7:15 to 7:30 p.m.
MISTRI could not recall the clothing worn by
STRHAN, other than he was not dressed in a coat or tie
and wore a shirt and trousers.

MISTRI concluded by noting SIRHAN made no comment
about Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, the current political
situation, or the primary election being held in Califomia.
Further, he stated that SIRHAN gave no indication of
emotional instability or any type of contemplated violent
act. MISTRI further noted that when SIRHAN asked him to go
shoot pool, there was no time limit suggested. He further
stated that it was his opinion that SIRHAN appeared to be
lingering with nothing to do and was seeking his company.

He noted, however, that no time limit was suggested about
shooting pool, inasmuch as he refused SIRHAN's offer outright.

JANICE ELAINE DUCY was contacted at the Corona
High School where she is a senior. She resides at 226
Hillside Avenue in Norco, California. She stated that two
years ago in the summer which would have been 1966, she
worked for two and one half months at the Granja Vista
Del Rio Farms as an exercise girl and as a groom. She
knew a ‘person there by the name of SIRHAN SIRHAN that she
referred to as SOL SIRHAN. She observed his photograph
on the television on June 5, 1968, as being the person
who shot ROBERT F, KENNEDY in Los Angeles.

She advised that she and LINDA SEABOLT had

.worked at the farms in the summer, along with TERRY WELCH,
an unrecalled Mexican boy, and SIRHAN SIRHAN. She advised
SIRHAN was no particular friend of anyone. He did not date
any girls in the area, and he did not run around with the
other employees. He lived near the corner of Fifth and
Hamner in Norco, California. She believes that he lived
alone or with someone who worked in the area. She said

she was never at his residence but had seen his car parked
on that corner several times and assumed that he“lived right
in that area.. She said he did not like the Norco area and
commented that he had traveled home most of the time on
weekends to Pasadena and that he continually talked about
how much better Pasadena was than Norco. She advised that
she never heard him make any political type comments or
enter into any discussions regarding politics. She said the
only comment she had ever heard him make against anyone was
that he had referred to Jewish people as "dirty Jews." She
said that although he was well spoken and appeared to be well
educated and had a good vocabulary, he was prone to use very
foul language in the presence of both girls and boys. She
said that he did not appear to be the type of person

that was suited to handle horses and other animals, as he
continuously treated them in a cruel manner and seemed

to be quite a bit afraid of them. He seemed to have a chip
on his shoulder due to this and because of his small size. She

said that she heard him make comments that many of the

but she did not think he was a particularly good rider

make a good jockey. She advised that she heard later that
he was fired, and she has never seen or heard anything
about him since the fall of 1966. She said that she quit
in September of 1966° to return to school but that she and

might know SIRHAN. She advised that she did not believe
