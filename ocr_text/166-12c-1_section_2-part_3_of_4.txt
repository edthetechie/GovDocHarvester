ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Investigation is continuing in order to develop
full background information concerning Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan as well as that of members of his immediate family
and associates,

With respect to a previous statement attributed
to Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, as
reported by the news media on June 6, 1968, alleging
Sirhan was associated with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of
America, and a vehicle registered to Sirhan's brother,
Adel, was observed on January 16, 1966, in the vicinity
of Baces Hall, 1528 North Vermont, Los Angeles, California, |
where a meeting sponsored by that organization was being ON
held, information has been developed indicating Adel Sirhan |
had previously been employed as a musician at the Fez Res-
taurant, 1508 North Vermont, adjacent to Baces Hall. Full
details are being developed with respect to this phase of

our investigation.

On June 9, 1968, a United Press International
release datelined Cairo made reference to the arrest of
one Soliman Sirhan by Iraqi authorities as an Israeli spy
alleging he was a brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Sirhan's
mother, during an intensive interview by FBI Agents on June 10,
1968, volunteered she had heard this newscast and stated she
has only five sons, Sirhan, Munir, Sharif, Adel and Saidallah,
none of whom are living outside the United States. The
individual to whom the United Press International referred

was unknown to her.

been located who were witnesses to the shooting of

Senator Robert F, Kennedy and who positively identify

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as the individual who fired the ~
shots at Senator Kennedy, This phase of our investiga- ”~
tion is being exhaustively pursued.

According to information furnished by ambulance
attendant Max Alma Behrmann, after responding to the call
at the Ambassador Hotel, a distraught Mrs, Kennedy attempted oy
to keep him from assisting the Senator stating "Keep your a
hands off him, I'm Mrs. Kennedy." As the Senator was placed
in an ambulance, an argument ensued between Behrmann and
Mrs, Kennedy as to who would accompany the ambulance and
again, according to Behrmann, when he questioned Mrs, Kennedy
while en route to the hospital as to what had transpired, she
stated "I don't give a damn what you say," grabbed his record
book and threw it out of the ambulance. Upon noting the
Senator was having difficulty breathing and thereafter trying
to assist him, Behrmann was told by Mrs. Kennedy "You keep
your dirty filthy hands off my husband," and she struck him
on the right side of his face stunning him. He further recalls.
Mrs. Kennedy called to a male associate who was sitting in the
‘front seat to "Come back here and throw this ambulance man out;
he's bothering me; he's asking too many questions."

It was further reported by a witness at the hospital
that upon arrival there Mrs. Kennedy grabbed a camera from a
newsman, knocking it to the floor, and she also swung at the
newsman hitting him in the chest area. Senator Kennedy's
bodyguard then jumped over the stretcher and punched the

newsman in the face.

Of possible significance is the fact that among
items found on Sirhan's person when taken into custody was
a newspaper article by David Lawrence captioned "Paradoxical
Bob" and highlighting the fact that while Kennedy vigorously
opposes the war in Vietnam, he has nevertheless recommended
full assistance to Israel “with arms if necessary" to meet

the threat of the Soviets...

In addition, whereas press reports claim Rafer Johnson,
Olympic champion, and Roosevelt Grier, professional football
player, subdued the assailant, investigation reveals the first
to reach the assailant were two hotel employees. They then
were assisted by Grier and Johnson, -

Aaron Lee Meyers, mentioned above as being held as a material
witness, has been charged with murder and two other male Negroes

STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE

Literature distributed by the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC), headquartered at 360-362
Nelson Street. S.W , Atlanta, Georgia, describes itself
as not being a membership organization, but rather an agency
attempting to stimulate and foster the growth of local pro-
test movements. SNCC was born out of the sit-in movement
which erupted across the South beginning on February 1, 1960.
A conference at Raleigh, North Carolina, that Spring, brought
together many of the demonstrating Southern students in a
loose network of militant youth which was officially named
SNCC in October, 1960.

A source has advised that in May, 1966. Stokely
Carmichael was elected National Chairman by the Central Com-
mittee. in May, 1967 Carmichael was replaced as Chairman
by H. Rap Brown, with Carmichael assuming the position of
Recruiter and Organizer for the SNCC. In August, 1967, at
the invitation of Fidel Castro, Carmichael participated in
the Organization of Latin American Solidarity Conference
which was held in Havana Cuba. Subsequent thereto, Carmichael
traveled to Hanoi and other sections of North Vietnam. He
returned to the United States in December, 1967, at which
time his passport was picked up because of travel to un-

authorized countries.

A source advised that when Carmichael was elected
Chairman of SNCC, the organization embarked on a program of
eliminating Caucasians from its ranks. With the election of
li Rap Brown as Chairman in 1967. it embarked on a world-
wide struggle for human rights am to take a firm stand
against violations of these rights by the American Government
and to strengthen its programs of opposition to the draft
and to the United States involvement in Vietnam.

Literature distributed in February. 1968. identi-
fies SNCC as an organization in the revolutionary vanguard.
It advocates thai to be successful it is necessary to deve-
Lop a rcevolutionary ideology and revolutionary program.

On August 13, 1967. while addressing a group in
the Watts area of Los Angeles, California. H Rap Brown said
"you better shape up America. or we'll burn you down." Later
in February. 1968. in a publicized note Brown wrote. "America,
if it takes my death to organize my people to revolt against
you and to organize your jails to revolt against you and to
organize your children, your God. your poor, your country,
and to organize mankind to rejoice in your destruction and
ruin, then here's my life."

Mr. Edmund A. Stephan, Jre

Dear Mr. Stephan:

. The Attorney General has asked me to thank
you for your letter of June 12.

You have misquoted Mr. Clark. He has never
stated that the assassinations of Senator Kennedy
and Dr. King were each the work of one man. He
has stated that there is no evidence in either case
of the involvement of.more than one man.

This is still true.

A source advised that when Carmichael was elected
Chairman of SNCC, the organization embarked on a program of
eliminating Caucasians from its ranks. With the election of
Hi Rap Brown as Chairman in 1967. it embarked on a world-
wide struggle for human rights am to take a firm stand
against violations of these rights by the American Government
and to strengthen its programs of opposition to the draft
and to the United States involvement in Vietnam.

Literature distributed in February. 1968. identi-
fies SNCC aS an organization in the revolutionary vanguard.
It advocates thai to be successful it is necessary to deve-
Lop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary program.

On August 13, 1967, while addressing a group in
the Watts area of Los Angeles, California. H Rap Brown said
"You better shape up America, or we'll burn you down." Later
in February, 1968. in a publicized note Brown wrote. "America,
if it takes my death to organize my people to revolt against
you and to organize your jails to revolt against you and to
organize your children, your God, your poor. your country,
and to organize mankind to rejoice in your destruction and
ruin, then here's my life."

Find Violenee Cause, |
New Commission Told

WASHINGTON (UPI)
The pressing questions have
been posed.

Now comes the difficult
part: Determining whether
there is “something in -the
environment of American
society” that produces vio-
lence.

That in essence was the
assignment Presidest John-
son handed yesterday to his
new 10 - member National
Commission on the Causes
and Prevention of Violence,

AT A WHITE HOUSE
meeting with the members,
the President signed an ex-
ecutive order giving the
panel its official title, pro-
viding it with money and a
staff, and giving it a year to
report back on its findings
and suggested remedies.

Johnson announced crea-
tion of the commission last
Wednesday after the shoot-
ing of Sen, Robert F. Ken-
nedy in Los Angeles. While
that act was not mentioned
at the meeting, the Presi-
dent’s clear mandate was to
determine whether there
are basic flaws in the
American way of life which
give vise fo such political
murder,

Johnson urged the members |
to make a “penetrating |
search” that will benefit not |
only America but other
countries at a time when
violence is an “‘internation-
al phenomenon.”

BEGINNING WITH
Chairman Milton §. Eisen-
hower, president emeritus
of Johns Hopkins University |
and brother of former Pres- |
ident Hisenhower, Johnson |
went around the table ex-
racting from each member |
promises to go to work
immediately without pr e-
udging the issues.

Johnson suggested the
commission explore, among |
other things, these ques-
ions: |

—‘Is there something in
he environment of Ameri-
can society or the structure |
of our- institutions that

causes disrespect for the
aw, contempt fo; $

June 12, 1968

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F, KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Investigation is continuing in order to develop
full background information concerning Sirhan Bishara
Sirhan as well as that of members of his immediate family
and associates.

With respect to a previous statement attributed

to Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, as r

reported by the news media on June 6, 1968, alleging

Sirhan was associated with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of
America, and a vehicle registered to Sirhan's brother,
Adel, was observed on January 16, 1966, in the vicinity

of Baces Hall, 1528 North Vermont, Los Angeles, California,
where a meeting sponsored by that organization was being (
held, information has been developed indicating Adel Sirhan
had previously been employed as a musician at the Fez Res-
taurant, 1508 North Vermont, adjacent to Baces Hall. Full
details are being developed with respect to this phase of
our investigation.

On June 9, 1968, a United Press International
release datelined Cairo made reference to the arrest of
one Soliman Sirhan by Iraqi authorities as an Israeli spy
alleging he was a brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Sirhan's

mother, during an intensive interview by FBI Agents on June 10,

1968, volunteered she had heard this newscast and stated she
has only five sons, Sirhan, Munir, Sharif, Adel and Saidallah,
none of whom are living outside the United States. The
individual to whom the United Press International referred .
was unknown to her. me leks

been located who were witnesses to the shooting of
Senator Robert F. Kennedy and who positively identify
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as the individual who fired the
shots at Senator Kennedy, This phase of our investiga-
tion is being exhaustively pursued.

According to information furnished by ambulance
attendant Max Alma Behrmann, after responding to the call
at the Ambassador Hotel, a distraught Mrs, Kennedy attempted
to keep him from assisting the Senator stating "Keep your
hands off him, I'm Mrs, Kennedy," As the Senator was placed
in an ambulance, an argument ensued between Behrmann and
Mrs. Kennedy as to who would accompany the ambulance and
again, according to Behrmann, when he questioned Mrs, Kennedy
while en route to the hospital as to what had transpired, she
stated "I don't give a damn what you say," grabbed his record
book and threw it out of the ambulance, Upon noting the
Senator was having difficulty breathing and thereafter trying
to assist him, Behrmann was told by Mrs. Kennedy "You keep
your dirty filtby hands off my husband," and she struck him
on the right side of his face stunning him. He further recalls.
Mrs. Kennedy called to a male associate who was sitting in the
front seat to "Come back here and throw this ambulance man out;
he's bothering me; he's asking too many questions."

It was further reported by a witness at the hospital
that upon arrival there Mrs. Kennedy grabbed a camera from a
newsman, knocking it to the floor, and she also swung at the
newsman hitting him in the chest area. Senator Kennedy's
bodyguard then jumped over the stretcher and punched the
newsman in the face,

Of possible significance is the fact that among
items found on Sirhan's person when taken into custody was
a newspaper article by David Lawrence captioned "Paradoxical
Bob" and highlighting the fact that while Kennedy vigorously
opposes the war in Vietnam, he has nevertheless recommended
full assistance to Israel "with arms if necessary" to meet
the threat of the Soviets.. .

In addition, whereas press reports claim Rafer Johnson,
Olympic champion, and Roosevelt Grier, professional football
player, subdued the assailant, investigation reveals the first
to reach the assailant were two hotel employees. They then
were assisted by Grier and Johnson,

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR
ROBERT F, KENNEDY

o?

ROBERT SMITHS«-

: %

On June 9, 1968, Detestive Dale Buehler, Area One
Homicide, Chicago Police Department, advised that on Saturday,
June 8, 1968, at approximately 10:00 AM, two male Negroes,
subsequently identified as Robert Smith, also known as Yaree

On June 10, 1968, local Chicago radio stations,
in reporting of the killing of Abder Rayyan, of Jordanian
nationality, indicated that the motive for the killing might
be one of revenge or a demonStration of emotion by the Negro
assailants over the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy
by the Jordanian Arab national. One newscast stated that
Aaron Lee Meyers, mentioned above as being held as a material
witness, has been charged with murder and two other male Negroes
were being sought.

On June 10, 1968, Detective Dale Buehler, Area One
Homicide, Chicago Police Department, advised Aaron Lee Meyers
had not been charged with murder but was being held as a

Homicide, Chicago Police Department, advised that the where-
abouts of Smith and Walton are unknown at this time and inten-
Sive investigation is being conducted to locate these persons.

STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE

Literature distributed by the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC), headquartered at 360-362
Nelson Street. S.W , Atlanta, Georgia, describes itself
as not being a membership organization, but rather an agency
attempting to stimulate and foster the growth of local pro-
test movements. SNCC was born out of the sit-in movement
which erupted across the South beginning on February 1, 1960.
A conference at Raleigh, North Carolina, that Spring, brought
together many of the demonstrating Southern students in a
loose network of militant youth which was officially named
SNCC in October. 1960.

A source has advised that in May, 1966. Stokely
Carmichael was elected National Chairman by the Central Com-
mittee. in May, 1967 Carmichael was replaced as Chairman
by H. Rap Brown, with Carmichael assuming the position of
Recruiter and Organizer for the SNCC. In August, 1967, at
the invitation of Fidel Castro, Carmichael participated in
the Organization of Latin American Solidarity Conference
which was held in Havana, Cuba. Subsequent thereto, Carmichael
traveled to Hanoi and other sections of North Vietnam. He
returned to the United States in December, 1967, at which
time his passport was picked up because of travel to un-
authorized countries.

A source advised that when Carmichael was elected
Chairman of SNCC, the organization embarked on a program of
eliminating Caucasians from its ranks. With the election of
H Rap Brown as Chairman in 1967. it embarked on a world-
wide struggle for human rights am to take a firm stand
against violations of these rights by the American Government
and to strengthen its programs of opposition to the draft
and to the United States involvement in Vietnam.

Literature distributed in February, 1968. identi-
fies SNCC as an organization in the revolutionary vanguard.
It advocates thai to be successful it is necessary to deve-
Lop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary program.

On August 13, 1967. while addressing a group in
the Watts area of Los Angeles, California. H Rap Brown said
"You better shape up America, or we'll burn you down." Later
in February. 1968. in a publicized note Brown wrote. "America,
if it takes my death to organize my people to revolt against
you and to organize your jails to revolt against you and to
organize your children, your God. your poor. your country,
and to organize mankind to rejoice in your destruction and
ruin, then here's my life."
