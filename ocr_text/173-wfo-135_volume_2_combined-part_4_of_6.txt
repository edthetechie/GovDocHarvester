After unsuccessful attempts to contact DEL RIO on
6/6 and 7/68, contact with him was established on 6/10/68,
at which time he was interviewed and furnished the information
hereinafter set forth:

GABRIEL GOMEZ/DEL RIO MON, Anartment 404, 6631
Wakefield Drive, Alexgndria, Virginia, telephone nunbey i,
was interviewed in the presende of an associate, PEDRY TRABAZO,
in the latter's apartment, number 414, 1225 13th Str
Washington, D, C. (telephone number 332-7894). DEL RIO, born
Pll onl lin Cuba, exhibited pavers showing that he was
honorably discharged as a Captain in the United States Army
on 3/10/68, His Army Serial Number was 02325635. He indicated
that he currently operated the Gapa Construction Company from
his home address,

DEL RIO, a veteran of Brigade 7506, advised that he
has been in charge of the annual wreath-laying at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier in memory of those lost in the Bay of Pigs
invasion. Indicating that he has had a nersonal relationship
in the past with Senator KENNEDY subsequent to DEL RIO's release
as a prisoner in Cuba, he advised that three days prior to the
ceremony on 4/14/68, he had personally extended an invitation
to Senator KENNEDY and his wife to appear at the ceremony af
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Senator KENNEDY accented the
invitation and at annroximately 2:00 on 4/14/68, anneared at
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier accompanied by Mrs. KENNEDY and the
eldest KENNEDY daughter. The Senator arrived driving an open
convertible. After conferring inside the building at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier with approximately 1? to 15 pnreonle
directly connected with the strictly memorial type of service,
Senator KENNEDY joined DEL RIC in the wreath-laying ceremony.

He did not make a speech. Aceording to DEL RIO, the event
received coast to coast television coverage and although only

a small group participated in the ceremony, there vere an

--- Page 43 ---
WFO 173-135

from the area of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the middle-aged
redheaded woman appearing in both photographs, approached
Senator KENNEDY. DEL RIO made an effort to physically force the
Senator to one side to avoid confrontation with the woman, but
the Senator rebuked his efforts and squarely faced the woman.

As related by DEL RIO, who was standing next to Senator KENNEDY,
a definite smell of alcohol was evident about her. She
immediately directed uncomplimentary remarks to Senator KENNEDY
such as "What the hell did you ever do for New York State --

I'm a taxpayer from New York -- What are you dotng here?" Although
highly offensive and disrespectful in her words, DEL RIO stated
that nothing in the nature of a threat was made by this woman.

He stated that during her tirade, Senator KENNEDY merely Looked
her straight in the eye, not saying anything. He thereafter
returned to his car and departed the area.

Subsequent to the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier, DEL RIO and the Brigade 2506 group went to the grave
of the late President JOHN F. KENNEDY to make a floral
presentation there, At that time, the above unidentified woman
was again observed in the company of the unidentified white
middle-aged man, who appears in the photographs with her. DEL
RIO commented that this unidentified man also carried a strong
odor of alcohol on his person, When the unidentified woman
began making deryogatory comments about Cubans being trash and
that they should be thrown out of the country, DEL RIO indicated
that he lost his patience and personally had words with this
woman, calling her "a drunken bitch."
