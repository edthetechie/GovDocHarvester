conversation at the station, it was concerning horses that
were running at Santa Anita.

He advised that SIRHAN was very polite to the
customers, attentive, showed an outstanding personality, and
one of the best employees that has worked for him since he

Sierra Madre, Pasadena, California, was interviewed at his
place of employment, Jack Davies Richfield Service Station,
2529 East Foothill Boulevard, Pasadena, California, and
furnished the following information:

BLESSING advised that he has been employed at the
Jack Davies Richfield Service Station for approximately
one and one~half months, since he moved to California from
Saginaw, Michigan. BLESSING advised that he never worked
with SIRHAN SIRHAN but that he met SIRHAN approximately
four or five times, when SIRHAN would come into the service
station to purchase gasoline. BLESSING went on to say that
he did not know SIRHAN by name, but, the morning after
Senator KENNEDY was shot, JACK DAVIES, Owner of the Richfield
Station, told him that SIRHAN was the individual who had
previously worked for him and was the same person who used
to come in and buy gasoline, BLESSING further stated that
when SIRHAN would come into the station in his 1956 pink
DeSoto, they would sometimes talk about automobiles. He
advised that approximately three weeks ago while STRHAN
was at the service station, he asked SIRHAN if he knew
anyone who had a good automobile for sale because he needed
transportation. BLESSING advised that SIRHAN told him that
he was planning on trading cars and, if he did trade for
another car, he would give BLESSING his old car, being a
1956 pink DeSoto.

BLESSING advised that SIRHAN was a very polite
individual and friendly. He told BLESSING that he understood
that BLESSING had a family and with the salary he was making
at this service station, he realized it was hard to support
a family on these wages. Therefore, if he did purchase a
new car, he would give BLESSING his pink DeSoto.

BLESSING advised that the last time he saw SIRHAN
was on Monday, June 3, 1968, exact time unknown, when SIRHAN
came into the Jack Davies Richfield Gas Station. He advised

that SIRHAN waited on himself and after he had put the gas
in his automobile, he waved to JACK DAVIES, Owner of the
Richfield Station, and said "hello" to BLESSING and drove
off. BLESSING advised that SIDNEY MC DANIEL took the money
for SIRHAN's purchase of the gasoline on this date.

BLESSING added that he was surprised when SIRHAN
offered him his 1956 DeSoto if he traded cars because he
had only known SIRHAN for approximately one month and had
actually only seen him four or five times at the most. He
advised that during the short period he knew SIRHAN even though
he did not know him by name, SIRHAN never discussed any of
his political views or nationalistic learnings or, for that
matter, never expressed any of his views.

BLESSING advised that he never met any of SIRHAN's
relatives or friends and the only time he saw SIRHAN was
when he would come into the filling station for gasoline
and at no time was anyone with SIRHAN, He added that
although SIRHAN was friendly and polite, he appeared to be
a loner.

BLESSING further advised that on at least two
secasions, he had a chance to look into the automdbile, the
1956 DeSoto, belonging to SIRHAN due to the fact that SIRHAN
had offered to give hiin this vehicle if he traded cars and.
at no time did he observe any weapon, ammunition, or anything,
for that matter, which would lead a person to believe SIRHAN
would do this type of thing.

During this time, SIRHAN resided with his mother,

and was paid $2.00 an hour by WEIDNER. WEIDNER stated
that he felt SIRHAN was completely honest, and he believes
that SIRHAN may have at one time had a key to the Organic~
Pasadena store for the purpose of opening the store early
on Sunday mornings to prepare a fresh fruit: and vegetable
stand.

WEIDNER described SIRHAN as a capable employee
who got along well with the other employees, and who always
presented a neat appearance and was courteous to the customers.
WEIDNER noted, however, that SIRHAN seemed to resent being
told what ttoo do,.and on occasion became aggressive and bad
tempered with WEIDNER. In this respect, WEIDNER received
the impression that SIRHAN resented authority and discipline,
and had an "inferiority complex" resulting from his being
physically small.

WEIDNER advised that the following employees at
the Organic-Pasadena store and his stores in Monterey Park
and Downey, California, would have been acquainted with
SIRHAN:

RETTA DRAKE, 2516 Strethmore, Rosemead,

Park stores and to stop at one of the stores before the
other. SIRHAN made the deliveries in reverse order, and
when WEIDNER mentioned this to SIRHAN, SIRHAN became very
angry and belligerent; called WEIDNER a liar and stalked
out of the store, indicating that he was quitting the job.
According to WEIDNER, SIRHAN re-appeared at the store
several minutes after this incident and told WEIDNER that
his (SIRHAN's) "conscience" would not let him continue his
employment with WEIDNER, but that he would stay for two
more weeks as per a prior oral notice of termination of
employment agreement with WEIDNER.

WEIDNER and SIRHAN had another disagreement on
or shortly before March 7, 1968, which disagreement arose
when SIRHAN failed to cover the vegetable stand with paper
bags as was customary at closing time. WEIDNER said that
when he mentioned this incident to SIRHAN, SIRHAN again
became extremely angry and defensive, accused WEIDNER of
firing him, and again left the store in an angry mood.
WEIDNER believes that during this argument with SIRHAN, he,
(WEIDNER) called the Pasadena Police Department and that
several police officers arrived and talked briefly with
SIRHAN in the store parking lot before SIRHAN left by himself.

In mid March 1963, WEIDNER received a notice to
appear before the Labor Commissioner, Division of Labor,
Law Enforcement, Los Angeles, regarding a petition filed
by SIRHAN for unpaid wages. On March 20, 1968, WEIDNER
and SIRHAN appeared before this Commissioner and a settlement
was reached whereby WEIDNER was required to pay SIRHAN
approximately $150.00 for wages due and severance pay.
WEIDNER noted, as previously mentioned,that RETTA DRAKE,
a former store manager for WEIDNER at the Organic-Pasadena
store, also filed a petition for unpaid wages with the Labor
Commissioner and appeared at this location at the same time
as SIRHAN. WEIDNER does not know whether SIRHAN and DRAKE
previously agreed to petition the Labor Commissioner at the
same time.

WEIDNER has not seen SIRHAN since March 20, 1968,
the date of the above appearance before the Labor Commissioner.

Mrs. DONALD BOYKO, who said her nickname is "Tosti"
was contacted at 1380 North Lake Avenue, where she is employed
in the Health Foods Store owned by JOHN WEIDNER, which is
known as Organic Pasadena Health Foods.

Mrs. BOYKO advised thet on Sundey,* June 9,1968 sic went to
1255 Morada Place in Altadena, California in an attempt to
locate an Arab student named ABDUL MAJED DABASS. Mrs.
BOYKO said she was accompanied on this trip by a Washington,
D, C. reporter named GEORGE LARDNER, JR., whose credentials
are unknown to her. LARDNER is staying at the Biltmore Hotel
in Los Angeles, California.

On the day following the identification of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, LARDNER came to Mrs. BOYKO and asked for her assistance in
locating some Arab students, who might know some background about
SIRHAN. Mrs. BOYKO agreed to help him and thought she
remembered an address for ABDUL DABASS, who some years ago
lived at 1255 Morada Place. However, she did not know the
address at the time and agreed to accompany LARDNER to pick
out the house. In this connection, Mrs. BOYKO indicated she
and her husband had met DABASS several years ago when he was a
student at the University of Southern California School of
Journalism. She believes that he is now married and not living
in the Pasadena area, but thought she might get a lead on his
present whereabouts by making a call to the Morada Place
address. She was unable to obtain any information from Mrs.
JOHNSON.

Mrs. BOYKO said she met SIRHAN SIRHAN at the time she went
to work ac WEIDNER's nselthn food store in Pasadena, which was in
December 1957 and was ccequainted* with him. until his departure from
the store.as an employee in .Mareh 1968. She said-she had. no contacts
with him outside of work, except on one or two occasions
SIRHAN and his mother attended Mrs. BOYKO's church (7th Day
Adventist Church in Pasadena) with the BOYKOs. Mrs. BOYKO

stated that in her opinion SIRHAN seemed to be a quiet and
intelligent boy and she would have had no reason to suspect
he was capable of violence or murder.

Mrs. BOYKO said the name of MAJED GUSSOUS was not
familiar to her.

Mrs. BOYKO stated that she does not know the
present whereabouts of DABASS and indicated that it is
possible that a Jordanian named SIMON (last name unknown)
who owns a barber shop in Pasadena, might know the present
whereabouts of DABASS. She said she had not mentioned this
possibility to Mr, LARDNER.

Mre. BOYKO concluded by stating she does not know
the names of any other Arab nationals or Arab types, who
might know SIRHAN and she stated that she has no knowledge
of any personal friends or relatives of SIRHAN.

Dear Sirs:

“On October 10, “1967 I examined the above named and the
following is ny ophthalmological consultation report.

This ophthalmological examination was done at your re-
quest and with permission of the above nameéda

* Please be informed that I have at hend a copy of his
medical file and this was perused prior to the ophthal-
mological examination and again following. :

This vefy pleasant and cooperative young man gave me no
significant general history, past history or femily his-
tory. . :

His present history states that he has never had glasses
and that the accident in question resulted from being
thrown from a horse September 25, 1966 at Corona. He
thinks he was thrown into a fence, but it was during a
fog and he and others were not certain of what he hit.
In any event, he stated that he was unconscious for a
short time and bezan to come to when he wes in the
Corona Community Hospitai, He stated that .he came to
while they were suturing his facial hecerations

Mr, Sirhan stated he was in hospital over night only
and released and then one we later returned to the
-Goctor for removal of sti hes. He stated that he was
back to work two weeks later and then noted poor move-
ment in the’ left eye with a feeling of tension and pain,

22-5 10-567 OC Re: ~

Attorneys at Lew

Sirhan

He apparently feels that these _symp toms . are’ still present.
He did not mention any twitching of the lid area or the’
left eye, although it is ment tioned | in his medical Pile.

Examination:

Mr. Sirhan was very cooperative and very pleasant, His
symptoms were somewhat vague and variable, but pleasant
cooperation was established and he proceeded with his
examination with full cooperation,

His vision without glasses was a better than normal 20/15
-in each eye,

A refra action was done and a most minimal refractive error

was found, namely a +0.25 cylinder in the right eye at

The fields were studied on the tangent screen and the
right eye was fully normal both quantitatively and quali-~

agifferences from the screen, The left eye however at first
gave a smaller field than normal, but when Mr, Sirhan was
invited to make a good logical effort, he did so and the
Visual fields in the left eye also showed a full normal
peripheral isopter and matched those of his right eye.

There was no complaint of twitching of the lids or areas

about the left eye, nor was there any sign of any muscu-

I can only state that this young man has a most excellent
pair of eyes and a most excellent surgical result of the
repair of his laceration at the nasal end of. the left
upper eyelid and there is no indication whatsoever of

further treatment or complications or resultant Gisabilities,

In addition to. the above, the eye examination shows no
defect of the interior of each eye nor any localization

of any central nervous system defects |

re d/a: 9/25/66 :
Dear Sir: - ‘

-Mr, Sirhan Sirhan was seen again in my office on October 9, 1967. At this _

" time he stated that he has not been working and that his. symptoms are

- essentially the same. He states he has pain in his low back and a feeling
- of tightness around the left eye. He states that the sensation around the
‘left eye seems to be increased with cold- weather .

’ EXAMINATION: Pupils are equal and react to light. Funduscopic examina-
_’ tion is within normal limits, Extra-ocular movements are intact, There is
“no nystagmus. Patient walks well on his heels‘and toes. Tendon reflexes
are active and equal bilaterally throughout. I found no pathological toe
signs. Patient reports tenderne Ss on palpation over the upper sacrum,
Back movements are carried through a normal range. Forward bending is
accomplished to a pOint at which the fingertips touch the toes. _ Straight
leg raising is accomplished to 85 degrees bilaterally .

COMMENT: 1 find no evidence of any neurological problem. Relative to
the back problem, I believe the patient's condition should be considered
permanent and stationary, disability factors being subjective complaints

. Of low back pain that I would assess as minimal in degree. The patient's
eye problem should probably be evaluated by Dr. Kiehn. No return appoint-
ment was made to see this patient, If I may be of any further help in his

fare, please let me know. _

Attention: Miss Stiner ; No; 02X 203445

Dear Sir; > -

This, isa report concerning Mr. Sirhan Sirhan, a 23- ~year- ~old, right- ~handed
male seen in my office on September 5, 1967.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Discomfort of chin, left eye and low back.

"PRESENT ILLNESS: On September 25, 1966, while at work, the patient was
thrown froma horse. The patient reports He was unconscious for an unknown
period of time. He reports that he was taken to a hospital by ambulance and
started regaining consciousness while his wounds were being stitched. The
patient was hospitalized overnight. He states that they wanted him to stay
longer but he did not like the idea. The patient returned to the doctor. about
a week later to have the sutures removed and was told that he should stay
off work for ten to fourteen days. When the patient returned to work, he
worked around the barn for about two weeks and then résumed his work as an
exercise boy. He states that on resuming this work, he noted increased
discomfort, particularly around the left eye and also low back discomfort.

He was subsequently seen by the doctor who had originally treated him and
then was referred to two other doctors, Because the patient had subsequently ©

‘moved to his home in Pasadena, he was then referred to Dr. Kiehn in Pasadena.
Sometime in November 1966, the patient was discharged from his job because
he felt that he was unable to physically work the hours on the job that were
required of him. The patient reports that he has not been working since his
discharge from that employment. .
The patient states he has noted no particular change in his symptoms in the
Jast few months. He describes the left eye complaints as being waves of
pain in the eye itself and a tight sensation in the skin around the left eye.

6 September 1967 - Page a . Re: SIRHAN, Sirhan B.

‘He reports a persistent pain under his chin and a feeling of tightness of the
skin under his chin that interferes with his shaving. The patient reports
that he has back pain all the time, but'this is increased with bending move-
ments or with lifting even minimal weights. Patient has noted no accentua-
‘ tion of back pain with coughing or sneezing. He reports no lower extremity.
pain. ‘

PAST HISTORY: No operations. “No previous hospitalizations. No serious
illnesses . No other accidents or injuries. No allergens known .

PHYSICAL EXAMINAT ION: The patient isa : small, thin male not in acute
distress,
Blood Pressure: 120/70 RAS, 2 0/70 LAS: :

' Head: There isa small, well-healed scar near the i inner canthus of the left
eye and some slight prominence in the medial aspect of the left supraorbital
ridge. The patient reports tenderness on palpation in this region | of the supra-
orbital ridge. . . -
Neck: Supple.

Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.
Heart: Regular sinus rhythm, No murmurs heard.
‘Extremities: No gross deformities.

" NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
- Sensorium: Patient is alert, oriented and cooperative.

Cranial Nerves; a
I . Essence of peppermint. perceived bilaterally. :
Il Patient reports a general constriction of the left visual fields that

is not consistent to the confrontation testing. The optic discs
appeared normal bilaterally.
Ill,1V,VI_ Extra-ocular movements were intact. I found no nystagmus.”

Vv Patient variably reported hyperesthesia over the right chin,
VIL Facial movements were unimpaired. Corneal reflex was present

VII Faint watch tick was heard bilaterally.
KX ,X ’ Palate elevated in midline. There was no impairment of phonation

Sensory Examination: Pin wheel, cotton wisp and vibration were perceived
throughout i

6 September 1967 ~ Page 3 - Re: SIRHAN, Sirhan B.

Cerebellar Examination; There is no nystagmus. .There is no ataxia. Tandem :
walk is well p: pe erformed , ;

_ Reflexes: Tendon and supcrficial reflexes were active and equal bilaterally.

I. T.found nc no pathological toe signs.

. Back Examination: Patient reports tenderness on palpation over the lower
. three lumbar spines. There appears to be slight paraspinous muscle spasm °

in the lumbar region. Back movements were carried out through an essentially
normal range, the patient reporting low back pain at the extremes of these ©

: movements. Forward bending is accomplished to a point at which the finger-

tips touch the toes. Straight leg raising is accomplished to 85 degrees |

: bilaterally, the patient at this time reporting low back pain.

. IMPRESSION AND COMMENT: The patient reports that he’ was unconscious

at the time of his injury, although the medical reports that I had available for

review did not verify this. At any rate, I found no evidence of a neurological

problem at this time. The patient reports discomfort in the region of the
facial scars. I believe there is a significant functional overlay that tends to .
magnify these complaints. The patient reportedly sustained a contusion of

’ his back at the time of his injury and currently has complaints of pain in his

low back. Arrangements were made for lumbar spine films, and I have asked
the patient to return in about one month for re-examination. I believe the
patient should be seen again by Dr. Kiehn for his re-evaluation relative to
the scars and the complaints involving the left eye. I believe the patient is

-capable of returning to work as a stable boy at this time.
