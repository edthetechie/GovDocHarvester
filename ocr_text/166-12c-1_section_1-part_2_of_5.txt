SUBJECT-

REFERENCE-

1. The following guidance has been transmitted to USIA media:

2. All strata of American society are shocked and horrified by the Kennedy
shooting. From the President and his official family to the lowliest
members of the national community, all share the deepest compassion for the
Kennedy family. In the words of President Johnson, we all pray for the
Senator's recovery. .

3. It can be expected that once the initial statements of shock, horror
and grief have been made, there may be a flurry of extremist and intemperate
statements, statements critical of "a sick society" which can generate such
assassinations. These should be used only in direct ratio to the importance
of their authors.

kh, As in the death of John Kennedy, many in the world again will regard
today's tragic shooting in terms of a conspiracy. We cannot. and should not
pe in a position of adding to, or assessing in any way, this kind of
theorizing. We should stick strictly with official coments by the police

June 10, 1968

ASSASSINATION OF
SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

In our continuing investigation to trace the activities of Sirhan
Bishara Sirhan immediately prior to the shooting of Senator Robert F.
Kennedy, several witnesses have been located who observed Sirhan in
the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel moments prior to the assault.
One witness, Edward Minasian, employee at the Ambassador Hotel,
observed the actual shooting. None of the witnesses interviewed observed
Sirhan in the company of any other individual.

A casual acquaintance of Sirhan's, Gaymoard Mistri, Pasadena,
California, when interviewed related he had a chance meeting with Sirhan
at approximately 6:10 p. m., Pacific Daylight Time, on June 4, 1968, at
a Pasadena restaurant. He claimed to have been with Sirhan until approxi-
mately 7:30 p. m., Pacific Daylight Time. During this period, Sirhan
gave no indication whatsoever of his intentions to commit the action that
followed several hours later. In fact, he invited Mistri to engage in a
game of pool and gave no indication that there would be a time limit or
that he had a subsequent engagement.

Walter S. Crowe, Jr., an admitted member of the Communist
Party, acknowledged an acquaintanceship with Sirhan, having last been
in contact with him on May 2, 1968. Crowe stated Sirhan was not a
member of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America nor was he a member
of the Communist Party. Crowe considered Sirhan "erratic" in his
political philosophy since he politically favored movements that are con-
sidered by the general populace to be left of center; however, definite
phases of his thinking were to the right of center, particularly on the
subject of the State of Israel.

It has been reported by the Los Angel cP CIMPNT Ai Boos

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Information was developed by our Los Angeles Office to the
effect that Sirhan has been identified as engaging in target practice with
a .22 caliber pistol on June 4, 1968, at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club,
Duarte, California.

Sandra Serrano, aged 20, who appeared on television imme-
diately after the shooting was interviewed in detail relative to her state-
ment that she heard shots and then saw a man and woman running from
the scene of the shooting. According to Serrano, as the woman who wore
a polka-dot dress ran by her she yelled "We shot him - we shot him." An
on-the-scene examination of the area in the presence of Serrano indicates
she was across the ballroom at least 140 feet from the scene of the shoot-
ing and at the time there were approximately 1, 500 people in the ballroom.
Detective C. J. Hughes, Los Angeles Police Department, advised in his
opinion it would have been physically impossible to hear a . 22 caliber
pistol being fired at a location where Serrano claims to have been,
pointing out many other individuals much closer to the shooting who were
inside the ballroom had not heard the shots. This phase of our investi-
gation is continuing.

On June 7, 1968, Judge Arthur L, Alarcon, Superior Court,
Los Angeles, California, issued an order prohibiting the release of any
extra judicial statements, documents, exhibits or evidence so as to
insure there be no interference with the constitutional right of Sirhan to
a fair trial.

Dear Mrs. Ridge:

' You may be sure that the President. shares your concern

‘ yegarding the relentless drive of the world Cemmutist move-
ment. The President is determined that cur country will |

_ Phere is no Federal legislation which effectively out-
laws the Communist Party sa such, and there is no law pre-
venting Communists from making speeches or holding private

or public meetings, Moreover, it ts not illegal in and of
itself to be a member of the Communist Party. he First
Amendment to the Constitution guarantees to everyone the right
to speak and pat. in print his views on a subject even though
_orxitioal of cur form of government or ef our public offietals.
It grants te each person thé right to associate and-meet with

persons of his own choosing.

In this regard the judicial iuterpretation and appli-

| gation of the Smith Aot which prehibits advocacy of the vie-

' Lent overthrow of the Government may be of interest. The
‘United States Supreme Court has held that the Swith Act way |

et be applied in a manner prohibiting persons from teaching

é6r advocating the abstract doctrine of violent overthrow of

little letter, be on your way
By plone or train or car.
God bless all hands that carry thee 5
No matter where they are. .
And bless the one to whom I send
This message from my heart
Bring peace and hope and happiness
With each new day that starts.

dear mr. president,

I listencd with vreapect & cautious attention to your
television broadcast to the nation regarding the death of senator kennedy,
you were so shocked & confusedit was obvious you felt very lonely groping
for an intelligent answer to ease your svrit, this foul act was not a
conspiracy & THE sickened culprit who could'nt spell kennedy & dia'NT
point the pistol before squeezing the trigger proved there wes no personsl
or moral reason for his act, he was a confused mentally i11 exhibitionist
suddenly turned homicidalfor expressive purposes only, it could have been

ou

twiee in your discourse you mentioned 'respect for law',

I beleive it Was VOLTAIR who coined the phrase’ pespect must be earned!

in his bitingletters to philip,

most certainly our judiciary & attorneys have not earned it because their

robes ere solied & their souls corrupt

one year ago I mailed’ to you a bound article I wrote (with letter attache

entitled! the corrupt, collusive, morally degraded U.S.A.IN which I too

requested intervention aid by my government to obtain fop me e jury

hearing in the courts of chester county,pa. the courts of which prompted

me to form my opinions, you helped by turning it over to a bureaucrat in

the poverty program who acknowleged seme but probably would not help hig

own mother, A repeat mailing six months ago to senator scott did noteven

earn me the courtesy of an anger,

dust one kind word by telephoneto the president judge gawthrop by phone

would probably alert the courtto rectify the grave injuatice they have

meted out& shock them into giving me a new jury hearing, I em no eriminal

or nut but mine is the reason the mind becomes obsesscd to take the law

into one'a own hands, mental agony combined with loneliness & enforced
‘vegetation prompts such thinking & it takes the strong discipline of a

rational mind not to reach for a pistol,

I was disappointed to hear your selected commitee consisted of juat the

hoipoli & not one of the rabble who could offer much, good health to you

sir with the burdens you bear.
unpresumptiousl MOST resgpectfujly
