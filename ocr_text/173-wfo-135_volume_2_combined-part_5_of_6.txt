On June 12, 1968, Mrs. Naomi Gross, 13 Russel St., Toorak, Australia,
(presently vacationing in London,England) appeared voluntarily at the
American Embassy London, and furnished the following information:

| “Y

Mrs. Gross stated she boarded Qantas flight 530 in Sydney, Australia at
7:00 PM, June 5, 1968, in routeto London. Further’, she said she was
traveling first, class and had sat next to-a man who said his name was
Clifford Flitzy, an American industrialist with Amerada Petrolium Co.

in Queensland, Australia, (the company is supposedly an American Canadian
venture) who worked out of the company's head office in Brisbane. Mrs.
Gross said Flitty also stated he was soon to become the new Vice-President
of Union Carbide. Source described Flitty as a man of avout 40 to 47

(he told her he was born in 1924), 5 feet 10 inches tall weight about 170
pounds, Gray hair, medium build, and wore glasses. Source reported the
flight en route to London stopped at Fiji Island, Honolulu, San Francisco,
New York, then London. She said before the plane landed at Fiji Island,
Flitty stated "I wish someone would put a bullet between Bobby Kennedy's
eyes, and I would wish I could pull the trigger myself." Further, source
stated that prior to their landing at Honolulu, the anouncement of the
Kennedy shooting was announced to the pdssengers by the captain.

Source advised that when the plane landed in San Francisco, there was to

be a four hour layover, and it was at this time the death of Robert Kennedy

was announced. Further, she said Flitty stated he was going to send a . Lot
telegram to Ted Kennedy which was to. read "After Two how about you?" and :
said he may even sign it, and further stated "we will be rid of this trash

forever." According to source Flitty talked about ordering champagne to

celebrate the tragedy. (attached as exhibit # 1 is the alleged note to be

sent to Ted Kennedy in Flitty's own handwriting). .

Mrs. Gross reported Flitty disembarked at New York. She said he was travel-
ing alone, and appeared to be in complete control of his faculties during
the flight. . :

Mrs. Gross declined to give her London address, stating she aia not wish to
involve the people with whom she was NTS /. E; Ee 47

It is the opinion of the reporting agent, that Mrs. Gross is a completely” ps
stable individual, was articulate in her speech, and gave every impression .
of being a highly intelligent woman NDEXED fon

Mr. JOHN HERBERS, “New York Times" correspondent
assigned to the Washington, D. C. Bureau, furnished the
following information:

He accompanied the campaign party of Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY through Oregon and California, having
jJoineé the group in the middle of March 1968.

At the time of the shooting of Senator KENNEDY
he was in the temporary press headquarters located in the
Colonial Room of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

Senator KENNEDY's victory speech was watched by
Mr. HERBERS and other members of the press corps on a
television set in the Colonial Room. About the time
Senator KENNEDY was giving his speech they were notified
the Senator would come to the press room for a news
conference for the "writting press". It had been understood
during the evening of June 4, 1968, that the Senator would
appear before the press, however, the exact time was not
known until the election trend had been firmly established.
Approximately five minutes before the shooting, they were
notified the Senator would be there shortly.

Mr. HERBERS stated there were probably between six
hundred and a thousand people in the Enbassy Room where the
victory specch was given. Because of the orowd, KENNEDY
staff workers and the members of the press were using the

kitchen area as a corridor between the Embassy Room and the
Colonial Room.

While still working in the press room (Colonial
Room), HERBERS heard gun shots in the kitchen area. At the time
they sounded like firecrackers, however, he rushed into the

(WoC), furnished the following information: |

“* “;.°. “He accompanied* the late Senator.ROBERT -F. ‘KENNEDY .
on both the Oregon’ and California Primary and was at.the . -.
' Ambassador Hotel;-Los Angeles, California, on the morning
of June 5, 1968, when Senator KENNEDY was assassinated, |
At the exact. time of the shooting of Mr. KENNEDY, he was in.
the Colonial Room of. the Hotel Ambassador .along. with the
other newspaper people waiting for Mr. KENNEDY to come into ~.:
the Colonial Room: for an informal ‘press conference. ‘Separating
the Colonial Room’ from the kitchen of. the hotel were double. .
swinging doors arid then another set of double swinging — _
doors arranged in:such a manner that people: in the: Colonial
‘Room could not see into the kitchen when a:waiter came out
of the serving kitchen. It. was his understanding. that
immediately after Mr. KENNEDY gave a victory talk on tele-
vision, he intended to come into the Colonial Room and talk
to the reporters gathered there awaiting him. He. believes
that it was one-of the press secretaries of Mr. KENNEDY,-
‘. the. exact one he could not recall, who made these arrangements,
_ but that in any event it was his understanding at the time
that Mr. KENNEDY would come directly from his TV talk to’
the Colonial Room and that reporters there would be able to
ask him questions concerning his. primary victory and future:
plans. e saw on.a.TV set that. Mr. KENNEDY had finished
his speech and so then he immediately moved closer to the
door. so he would have a better position in proximity to
Mr. KENNEDY to ask questions. He then heard a loud bang
which at first sounded to him like. someone was banging a
serying tray. on one of the stainless steel warming counters.
This was immediately followed by four other "bang" like
noises, and then it dawned on him that these were actually
shots from a gun.” He distinctly recalled only hearing five
bangs although subsequent events ‘revealed that actually
eight shots were fired from a gun. He immediately went
through the double set of swinging doors into the serving
‘kitchen, and the place was "complete bedlam.". He noticed
someone struggling with an individual but actually only saw

-left the podium and proceeded toward the Colonial Room which |
_Wwas off to his left. .He said he attached no significance to:

the fact Senator KENNEDY proceeded in the direction of the

. Colonial Room, as the routes taken by Senator KENNEDY were ~

not definite and he often went directly into a crowd rather .
than through some easier and less crowded route as planned.
He stated BILL BARRY or FRED DUTTON might possibly know why

: Senator KENNEDY proceeded to the Colonial Reom after his talk,

MANKIEWICZ stated he trailed Senator KENNEDY

about: ten to twelve feet as he moved. toward the Colonial.’ Room.

He said as he passed: through some double doors he heard-a
noise, similar to the sound of fire crackers, and thought it
was inappropriate to be setting off fire crackers.

He stated ‘he never saw SIRHAN SIRHAN, the suspected
assassin of Senator KENNEDY, and as he moved forward he recalled
seeing PAUL SCHRADE, a United Auto Workers official, lying on
the floor about two feet from the body of Senator KENNEDY .

He said he then saw a "tableau" of arms in a struggle
and a gun lying on a table. He said he could not see the head
of the man the group was struggling with.

He estimated that fifteen people were between him
and Senator KENNEDY when the shots were fired,

as he was about to finish his news broadcast, he heard a lot
of screaming and shrieking and someone ran into the foom
and shouted that Senator KiINNUDY had been shot. He immediately
left the room and forced himself through crowds of people
into the kitchen area. He walked up to Sunator K=NNDY who
was lying on the floor with his head in what appeared to be
blood. QUINN got up on a serving table and stayed there until
Senator K-NNEDY was removed from the room.

QUINN advised that Senator K..NNIDY was awake while
he was lying on the floor. QUINN recalled hearing a voice,
similar to Senator KENNEDY's saying "Can you please step

a rosary on his waist line and WPHEL KENNZDY was rubbing
his chest, ETHEL seemed to be calm.

Mrs. JEAN SMITH, BILL BARRY, DICK TUCK (advance man for Senator
