Dear Mr. President:

The Soviet Union is securing a Stronghold for hersels in
the Middle East. By supplying anms to the Arab states, and by sending
military experts and engineers to the Arab aunies to advise in the
use of those weapons, she is ereating an enormous military menace in
the Middfe East and making Soviet satellites out of the Arab countries.

This is a threat to American interests in that area and to
the cause of democracy throuhout the whole wonkd, yet the United
States joins with Russia in United Nations' resolutions and refuses
to act in accordance with the seriousness of the situation.

Our government must necognize the situation in the Middle East
as it is and we must act accordingly. I Strongly urge the estabLishment
of a strong committment to the only democratic state in the Middle
East, Israel, The United States must supply Israel with auns com-
parable to those being given the Arab states by Russia, and must support
her in diplomatic circfes. The Soviet action in Czechostovakia indicates

Russia's interests and her methods ~ we must not Let Israel down.

Sincerely yours,

Jed Logabnan

Deer sir:

The censpiretors behind the murders of nobt.rxeanedy and Dr. we
Luther King are seeing to it thet their assessins,xey and Sirhen,cet o
with life imprisonment insteed of the death penelty beceuse they are
afraid if the two essassinss lives are not spared they may inform on their
accomplices in revenge....fhis seems obvious. Both murders were cold-
blooded end premeditated and merited the supreme penalty.

rtiga
rr

In contrast,Lincoin's slaver,wilkes Booth.eand all of nis xrRampiks
accomplices were rcunded up in short order.Tney all surfered the supreme
penalty for their crimes. But that's how much justice has slipped in thie
country since the Civil var and ecrruption hes texen over. Some people
ere even so unkind as to suggest we mey heve reached the rotten stage. In
any event,we can hardly respect our country for the shameful part it is
olaying in these murders. uur F.B.I. and our Goverbment won't even look
for the rest of the accomplices. That also is apparent. we know they are
there beceuse of all the money that has heen spent on the ectuel killers
so fer. Money just doesn't mature out of thin air.Nor is the public sco
stupid to think that it does. The services of Cooper end Percy Foreman
doen't cmme cheaply. But,as I have said, that's how much we have slipped.
In truth,the hypocrisy and deceit involved nere is enough to turn the
average citizen's stomache.

And so we asktis this the " law and order" Nixon talks about?
If I were Nixon I wouldn't feel s0 proud these days. His election was
bought with the blood of his politicel opponents and the anguish and tears
of their children...Meanwhile those who furnished the bliod-money for
these murders goes free....And out here in Galifornia at the Army Bresidic
in S.F. they are sending teen-age kids to prison for L5 or twenty years
for dissenting. This is being brought about by Army brass filled with
bone-chilling vindictiveness and spite who are angry because of the
frustrations and failures of the vietnam war.They are making an" example"
of these sick youngsters. And that,too,is how rotten we've become. The
cases will be appealed,of course, Yet it all sounds like a page out of
Hitler's menual. Under such wretched circamstances our government can
hardly expect anything but division in this nation. Believe me,it takes
a bastard--no less--to believe in his country nowadays. I fought for this
nation in w.wW.ll---but I am beginning to wonder why....

when we observe whet is happening in San Francisco's Presidio we citizens
realize what is facing us if this country ever truly becomes a military
stete...The Constitution's "cruel and unusual" punishment clause doesn't
mean anything to those Army Fascists up there. Fifteen years imprisonment for
refusin. to eat....Good God!..No wonder everybody is aroused over this
shocking affair here in California!....That Army brass up there needs the
discipline thad—eibiesco's police need. They've both gone loco witn power...

President Richatd Nixon of The United states Of America
ur. Edgar J. Hoover, Director of The F.B.I. .
Mr. Grant Cooper, Defense Attorney, Los Angeles Supreme Court

Dear Sirs:

I don't want any of you to ve tempted into a position of Martyring
human existence, and jeopardizing your own personal futures, or that of
the world, as a whole. I realize the importance, of keeping the contents
of this letter, a secret, from the world, at least, for he length of tine
to justifiably, prove the truth, of reclity, pertaining to the case, of
the Assinationism, of the late, Rotert Kennedy!

If your intentiongg have beem for Mr. Sirhan Dishara Sirhan; to
publicly; martyr himself; to tempt; the true plotters; and the us: inator;
vfnbigbert Kennedy; into the open; i could agree with your plan; as long;
a§,iS“no involvement; of Mental Torment; or threat; of Insecurity;
to that, of Mr. Sirhan; or his immediate family; or relatives! I was once
assigned; to the similarity; of this case; another arrangement of darth's
vPasts; by Lyndon Johnson, the former rresident of the United States of
America; more than one arrangezents of Earth's iasts! He had asked me to
Visit with Robert Kennedy and family; which I did; one afternoon, at a
beach. I was present; the night of Robert Kennedy's assinationism; anot~
her arrangement of warth's Pasts; when I walked in through that kitchen;
after having watched; outside; so.eone struggling, to hold Kathie Fulmer,
and was very suspleiéus, but decided; that the best move; was not to show
my suspicions; and walked on by,she, and that individual, sraying no arm
would come to her, I noticed four or five individuals; around, inside the
kitchen, surrounding “r. cirhan; thinking it was very possible; thet they
wore not members of the I'.3.13 as they had asserted themselves; to vea;so
to not betray my suspicion to tiem; I kept on going; into the room; wheres;
they were already leading; Mr. Robert Kennedy from; their intenti.ms; to
go through that kitchen; i woiceabjy; pleaded with them, not to take him
through that kitchen. I have the memory, of witnessing, the corwd, the ¢
jostling reality, in it's insecurity, the individuals, passing the gun!
from one hand to the other, until that gun, that killed Robert Kennedy.
finally reached the bare hands; of Mr. Sirhan} the others had gloves on!
and pushed their way through the crowd to set out of there, in a hurry
saying, they were after someone,l#aving Mr. Sirhan, standingthere alonej
and were} apparently! those involved in the plot} of the ass&nathabion!

I am not sure; that Kathie Fulmer; had been one of the individuals; who had
been duped; and betrayed; into being part of the plot, others not letting
her know; the truths of their intentions; asserting to the individuals;

of a Mental Instity tony their intenti ns; to offer a minor case , of
their files; a renewed life; of something worthwhile; in the United States
of Americas as part of their camouflage; and asking her to pick#ogt the
Cases; and study them, she finally, picking out the cases of someone; who
had fallen; off a horse; which was their psychological click; of betray-
alisms; to others; and themselves; actually, their intenti ns; not being
above baods in a dedicationism; to Love's Priority} I had been an indiv -
idual; who had been many long y ars; of Militarism; on the ilifed Side;

in army; Navy; anu Air Force; interchangeaoly; with the forces; of the
United States Of America; too as well; having already; been with; General
vouglas Macarthury at Pearl Harbor, advising him of the possibility; of
the Japaneses; bombing Pearl Harbor, later; after that; I also; spent a

a ghort time; as a patient; in the same hospital, with Ike isenhower,
This is only, a very short whumary; of my pact; of Earth's Pasts! I sins
cerely; and very seriously; hbpe; and pary; for your sakes; and of the
whole vorldy that everything; will be betters; than before; compared to
other arrangements of Earth's Pasts! I hope} that Space Observational
becurity; Has monitored the case; extensively; and can show it; in filme
ed recordings the Earth's hu.an indiv:.duals} whe were responsible! for
tiie dssassinationism) of Robert Kennedy} and that} it's shown to humane

ity{ on a lengthy T.V. Runt Wishing you! Ald The Best! Towney
