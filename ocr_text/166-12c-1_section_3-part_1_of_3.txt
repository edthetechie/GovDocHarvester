721 Third St.,
Gilroy, Calif.
Oct. 1%, 1968.

The Honorable George W. Milias, .
Member of the Assembly, 22nd. District,
State Capitol, -. ‘
Sacramento, Calif. 95814.

Sir,

‘ This letter is to. bring something to your attention that has been
on my mind for a long time. Because of your record locally, and your rep-
utation for pursuing something until results are obtained, I hope you will
chamnel this correctly to get maximum results. ~

’ Red tape I cannot cut-the channels open to you I do not have, but I
have been writing letters. The first.was to Eric Sevareid, who in Look
Magazine last July had three articles about "America is Pointed in the Right
Direction", or some similar title in the face of the senseless assassina-
tion of Robert Kennedy. Another was to Walter Cronkite, who permitted
Chicago "Boss" Daley to air his views over the network after the disaster
that was the Democratic National Convention. Then to Attorney-General
Ramsey Clark, when even President Johnson cried out"for God's Ses gt us
have liberty, but under the law". To Gov. Reagan, asking that my,letter be
properly forwarded addressed to Richard Nixon when he spoke in Santa Clara;
to Vice-Pres. Humphrey and Edmund Muskie to Waverly, Minn. as the campaign

' started. I have received one answer to all these-from Vice-Pres. Humphrey.

The immediate subject is the punishment of the assasins of Martin
- Luther King and Robert Kennedy. Why the innumerable delays, the careful
protection of men caught with smoking guns that commit the crimes? Were
circumstantial. evidence involved, where the suspect might be wrongfully
convicted--but these, along with the killers of Medgar Evers, the three
civil rights workers buried under a construction site, the housewife, Mrs.
Liuso---all the murderers tried and released with no comparable death
penalty. What right has the man to live or even ask for a trial who mur-
dered the 8 student nurses in cold blood? .

Unter the repeated circumstance of release of these criminals due to
all the loophioles and technicalities to be found in the law, justice is so
seldome done these days in the top level crimes that real justice is becom-

-ing the travesty of our time.

_ Delays, protection of the criminal, loopholes--these are bad enough,
put how much greater compounded is the disgrace of solution when the
criminal is remanded to psychiatrists-declared incompetant, unfit, insane-
/ some excuse but so effective, to Bet them off for rehabilitation. Our

latest in the California courts are the two who killed 3 in 3 states, left
Susan Bartolome for dead; but she is going thru life without speech and

totally paralysed. Now one of these fiends is ealled a "mental eripple*

. . .

The insanity or mental defective bit is the worst of all, and oddly
enough continues to get our wholehearted cooperation in the courts. Our
society could become saturated with these whom the optimistgwish to
rehabilitate. If statistics were known, how many of these, from rapists
to murderers, are released for a_second chance which only turns into the
oppertunity to repeat the offen®e-often more savagely than the first time?
Why, in our society, do the courts permit the lives of these deviates to_
be so carefully treated? How 16ng would it have taken justice to be done
thru regular channels, if the peculiar, cancer-ridden little man who did
not. care about himself had not shot Lee Harvey’ Oswald? And what would the
verdict have been? ~~

. None of the loopholes can be plugged at federal level--it is the
responsibility of the states. But always with so much time elapsing to
‘take the edge off of our anger and hatred--to insist ona fair trial when
.in my estimation no trial is deserved--meanwhile, the murdéred ones are
gone, and the maimed are left to struggle thru life. Are Martin Luther
_King and Robert Kennedy important enough to our society for justice to be

_ done, at least in these cases, or are they to be let go scot free, or with
' some insignificant sentence? What became of the way some countries still
‘handle it--punishment fits the crime, and it is carried out in kind? We
_ «just might have a far less permissive society if the culprits kmew that
- their lives would be forfeited exactly as they killed or maimed their.
‘victims. The idea would be realistically effective; it is not sadistic.

The word, for the average citizen, Mr. Milias, is frustration-which
‘Seems to be the only recourse after the dismay, shock, and helplessness
engendered by these acts. We are, also, always hopeful, awaiting a change
of administration, etc. ad infinitum. We wait, to what end? Certainly
not to have our feelings compounded by the inadequacies of laws or the
inactivity of officialdom which seems to harbor, even nurture, the contam-
inating criminals, rather than eliminating them. How is our best interest
_ served when we eater to the criminals rather than eliminating them? How
many more postponements will Sirhan get--along full news coverage with
' pictures which maintains that the trial was postponed in order not to .

lock the jurors up over the holidays--since June 6 yet!

= Does not the frustrated citizen, Mr. Milias, have a right to ask:
““—..lhow long, Uh, Lord, how long,/“before the courts will eliminate all the

delays that favor the criminals life in order to dispense punishment as . .——
fast and as final as the death or maiming that comes to those attacked?

po Questions I have, but answers I do not get-until We read again that

' yet another of these misfits has not been segtenced*to death as they should
be* Where could my’ letter be sent to be most effective? Who is the gover~
nor of Tennessee-the state in whose custody we find James Earle Ray, who

5 probably will be released for _lack of evidence as are most of ope eee en
"against negroes? What ‘ou do about n your official capac nee
Slate judfotery is invoived, Ld you please bring my letter ‘to their

- attention ‘also?

a anger

During a recent Richard
Nixon rally at the Pacific
Auditorium in Santa Monica,
local policemen began urgent-
ly pushing along a group of
long - haired picketers gath-
ered outside. Whereupon these
members of the witty and
sassy younger generation
dumbfounded them by setting
up the chant:

“Raise police salaries!
Raise police salaries!”

The cops can hardly rough
up anybody demonstrating for
that kind of goal and, in fact,
the picketers were making a
better point than the presiden-
tial candidate who was orat-
ing inside the packed hall.
Everywhere Nixon goes, he is
calling for strict law enforce-
ment and promising that
“new leadership and a new
attorney general” will put a
stop to crime — which, pre-
sumably, includes street dem-
onstrations and riots.

* * *

PROBLEM — Nixon is even
proclaiming himself an expert
in this area, but for a man
who believes himself about to
become President, he really is
taking dangerous political ad-
vantage of the country’s un-
dovbted concern about “crime
in the streets” and “law and
order.” The net effect of his
campaign could be to present
him and his prospective new
administration with a far
more serious problem than
the one Nixon speaks about so
forcefully — and which is, to
some extent, imaginary.

In Denver, on Sept. 25, as
an example, he said that in
Washington, D.C., “bus driv-
ers have to carry weapons.”
In fact, District of Columbia
law specifically prohibits
them from doing so, and the
D.C. Transit Company says it
would fire any driver who did.

Nixon relentlessly tells his
audiences that ‘crime’ has
risen nine times the popula-
tion increase and three times
as fast as it did in the
Eisenhower administration.
Whatever statistical basis
there may be for these asser-
tions; they are obviously too
slick, because crime statistics,
at best, are inaccurate, in-
complete and often mislead-
ing, and cannot be emnloyed
honestly in such generalities.

are
GENERALITIES — Nixon of-
fers some other vague gener-
alities to suggest that he also
would do something about the
social conditions in which
crime flourishes, but his pri-
mary emphasis always is on
tough law enforcement. It is
seldom on the improvement of
police persornel, techniques,
working conditions and under-
standing, all of which have to
precede any really effective
law enforcement.

Tronically, this comes at a
time when real progress in
improving American police
work is being made, some of
it under the impressive lead-
ership of the one official
Nixon never fails to attack —
Attorney General Ramsey
Clark. The Law Enforcement
Assistance Act that Clark
nursed through Congress
promises even further im-
provements.

For example, starting sala-
ries for the police in some

major cities have edged into
the $8,000 to $10,000 bracket.

which means at least twice as

In the same general period,”
Justice Department officials
believe, far more effective
police leadership at the top
has been developed, at least in
the major cities. The social
upheavals and urban disor-

forced mayors and police
commissioners to face up to
their problems and to take
intelligent steps to analyze
and deal with them.

EASIER — Thus, as many
high-ranking police and Jus-
tice Department officials’ see
it, coping with “crime in the
streets” is going to become
easier in the long run — but
coping with policemen may
become harder in the short
run. The political climate en~
courages some police forces to
strain civil authority, and
causes political leaders to be
hesitant or ineffective in res-,
training them. Policemen ob-:
viously taking the law into’
their own hands, in Chicago (a-
number of indictments will
stem from current -investiga-.
tions) are followed, predicta-
bly enough, by off-duty police-”
men beating up black mili-
tants in New York City,

It is this political climate
that Nixon's tough talk helps.
to create — although the rabid
George Wallace and any num-'
ber of local demagogues are
far worse. Nevertheless, Nix-
on clearly risks making such.
a point of “getting tough” that
his election will be interpreted’
by every heavy - handed
policeman in the country as a
license to heat up somebody
— probably somebody poor,
black or young, and prefera-|
bly all three,

Nixon would be entitled to-
replace Clark but if he should.
do so with a hard-liner, and,
then follow that by substitut-
ing tough cops for President

ments to the new Law En-

6a ____ SUN-SENTINEL, Mond,

VIEWED EDITORIALL

Millions of Americans undoubt-

edly will be cheered by the im-

pending prospects of a. bombing

halt in Vietnam. Some will hope-
fully assume the war could grind
to a halt, with no more American
boys fighting and dying. Others will
delight that their peacenik move-
ment will have won its point and
now there will be no more destruc-
tion raining down on their left
wing friends in North Vietnam.
, ._ But there are those, including
us, who look with considerable:
trepidation upon the g
Proposed bombing
cessation, even if it
would ha've the
bonus of warring on
a smaller scale. :
The reason for such :
concern is that once
again the mighty
United States would
be losing a war, MULLEN
making a waste of the some 25,000
men killed, the tens of thousands
more wounded, and the $100 billion
invested to ensure the freedom of
the South Vietnamese, who, of
course, truly would not be free
from the threat of Hanoi,
x * *

IN THE EVENT anybody has

forgot, we lost the war in Korea.
We didn’t win it, as could have
been accomplished, we lost it by
being pinned down in a stalemated
armistice that requires our mili-
tary presence in South Korea. We
lost, because we did not crush
Communist aggression as we had
promised. ‘
’ Instead, our national political
leadership arranged a humiliating
accommodation with a bush league
Communist outpost that stripped
us naked of our integrity before
the world.

And now: the Communists are
nearing repetition of the degrada-
tion by luring us into another rap-
prochement in Vietnam. From the
outset, Ho Chi Mish set the terms
for our further discomfiture: end
all bombing and include the Viet
Cong in the truce negotiations in
the form of the National Liberation
Front.

As much as anybody else, we
want to see the fighting end. We,
too, yearn for days of peace when
our young men can have normal
lives and our country can go about
its business in science and educa-
tion and improving the lot of the
less fortunate. ‘

Bombing Pause In Vietnam
Another Communist Victory

dent terms for Suspended war in
Vietnam. :

There was a lesson in Korea
but it has been ignored by our
leaders. Communists do not expect
us to conquer them and place their
territory under military occupa-
tion, But they do know that we will
attempt to negotiate a peace and
will be tolerant almost beyond
human endurance to that end.

The hundreds of meetings be-
tween the truce teams at Panmun-
jom, some of which amounted to
nothing more than entering the
room of the peace hut in the De-
militarized Zone and glaring in

silence across the table, set the
pattern of the political Strategy in
a no-win policy.

The pattern also includes the
divided nation, as in Korea and in —
Vietnam; the Demilitarized Zone
repeatedly violated by the Com-
munists, and the terrorist attacks
in territory under our jurisdiction,
not to forget the calculated provo-
Cations such as the USS Pueblo.

Our destiny in Vietnam, we fear,
is one more Lilliputian strand to
hold us prone against Communist
salami-style world aggression.
dowit Ntxbaef mur manary-and
economic commitments.

Our presence is required in
Western Europe because of the
Russian threat.

* * *

WE ARE LOCKED in Wegt
Berlin becatise there has been no
formal settlement of World War II
— once again because of a Com-
munist-divided nation, Germany.

And Cuba is poised at a shaft
aimed at our underbelly and the
Western Hemisphere.

Thus, it must follow to wonder
where the next pressure point will
emerge.

Perhaps it may be in the Middle

East. Or in Africa, Possibly in a
new confrontation in West Berlin
over closing the Autobahn; or at
The Wall.
_ Maybe the thrust will be in
Panama. But it Could edna
land to consolidate Southeas' ia
for the Reds with Burma, Sumatra
or Indonesia in the line of march
for Communist attack. ;

Any of these can be the cost of
an uneasy peace in Vietnam, as”
that war was the price we paid for
our failure in South Korea.

Mr. M. M. Rudolph

Dear Mr. Rudolph:

This is in reply to your correspondence of October Ts
1968, coneerning the trial of. the alleged slayer ef Senator
Robert F. Kennedy, Sirhan B. Sirhan.

‘As you know, the confinement of witnesses is both
. ‘for. their own protection and to ensure that the judicial |
processes may be properly carried out. Although this is
: an inconvenience for the persons involved, it is often’.
. . necessary. A citizen's desire to provide information he
_ possesses in spite of personal inconvenience is of great

_ importance to our. ju@icial system.

As for the frequent postponement of trials, this ‘te
also a method of ensuring justice. If an attorney has good
cause in the eyes of the court for postponement, it is
granted with the vlew that justice may more properly be
carried out. The objective of the court in such cases is -
‘to enable all persons fair treatment under due process of

law,

; Your interest in writing to express your views is
appreciated.
