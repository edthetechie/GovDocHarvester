group walked west down the corridor, they passed the doorway
where STROLL was standing. As the group passed, he received
a signal from STEPHEN SMITH, KENNEDY's brother-in-law, to
fall in behind so that STROLL could present his gift to
KENNEDY when the Senator reached his room.

STROLL advised that when he walked into the corridor
to the rear of KENNEDY's procession, he was standing near
Mrs. KENNEDY. It was at this time that he heard a series of
noises which sounded to him like firecrackers being exploded.
He thought there were six such noises. He recalled thinking
to himself that someone was setting off firecrackers. His
immediate reaction was to push out with his hands, and he
believed he pushed Mrs. KENNEDY, because when he looked down,
he saw Mrs. KENNEDY lying on the floor, and ROSIE GRIER was
lying on top of her. He stated it was at this point that he
felt a blow to his left leg and thought at the time that
someone had kicked him. Immediately following the series of
small noises, people began rushing into the corridor. He ran
out of the corridor into the Embassy Room through the doorway
which he had previously been watching. When he entered the
Embassy Room, he looked down at his leg and saw blood and
then realized that he had been shot. He yelled, "I have
been shot. I have been shot." His friend, DAVID ESQUIH,
who had not entered the corridor with him, was standing at
the doorway, and upon hearing STROLL state he had been shot,
proceeded to help him out of the Embassy Room. He was then
carried down the stairs and then through the front exit of
the hotel. There someone put him into a Yellow Cab, and he
was taken to the Central Receiving Hospital, where he was
treated for his wound. He was subsequently released from
the Central Receiving Hospital and admitted to the Midway
Hospital.

STROLL advised that at no time did he see his
assailant nor did he even realize at the time that Senator
KENNEDY had been shot. Since the incident, he has observed
the suspect's photo on television. STROLL advised that he
has never seen the individual depicted as the suspect before.

STROLL stated that his doctor told him that he
would probably be released on Saturday, June 8, 1968. His
doctor also told him that the bullet which struck him
appeared to have ricocheted from the floor before it hit him
in the left leg.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 8, 1968
Date

At approximately 10:15 AM on June 5, 1968, Detective
Lieutenant GERALD WRIGHT, Pasadena Police Department, advised
SA J. ROBERT SULLIVAN that the brother of the man who allegedly
shot Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY was being interviewed at the
Pasadena Police Department by Los Angeles Police Department
detectives. He identified the suspect as SIRHAN SIRHAN and
his brother as ADEL SIRHAN. Lieutenant WRIGHT introduced
SA SULLIVAN to Detective Sergeant WILLIAM BRANDT, Rampart
Division, Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). SA SULLIVAN
informed Sergeant BRANDT of the FBI's interest in this case.
BRANDT stated he had already informed ADEL SIRHAN of his
rights and they were nearly through interviewing him. He
said they planned to take him to the Rampart Division Station
and invited SA SULLIVAN into the interview room.

SA SULLIVAN identified himself to ADEL SIRHAN and
informed him SA SULLIVAN was interested in obtaining some
information concerning his family in general and his brother
SIRHAN in particular. After obtaining this information from
ADEL SIRHAN, SA SULLIVAN left the interview room and immediately
telephoned this information to the Los Angeles Office of the FBI.
After approximately five minutes SA SULLIVAN returned to the
interview room and was informed by Sergeant BRANDT that arrange-
ments had been made to go to the SIRHAN residence before going
to the Rampart Division.

SA SULLIVAN accompanied Sergeant BRANDT, Detective
JIM EVANS, Central Homicide Division, LAPD, and ADEL SIRHAN
in the LAPD car. Upon arrival at the SIRHAN residence, 696 East
Howard Street, Pasadena, the entire block was observed to be
crowded with vehicles and approximately 20 or more individuals
who appeared to be reporters were on the front lawn. There
were also many people standing around in the vicinity of the
SIRHAN house. SA SULLIVAN observed unidentified newsmen
examining trash in the trash cans at the rear of the residence.

Sergeant BRANDT and Detective EVANS accompanied by
ADEL SIRHAN immediately entered the residence by the front door.

SA SULLIVAN went to the rear of the house with other LAPD
detectives to determine if there had been anything taken by
newsmen from the trash cans. SA SULLIVAN does not know if
anything was taken from the trash cans prior to his arrival.
The two detectives began sorting the trash and SA SULLIVAN
entered the house through the rear door. On entering the
house Sergeant BRANDT informed SA SULLIVAN that a search was
underway in SIRHAN STRHAN's room located in the southeast
corner of the one-story house. Sergeant BRANDT and Detective
EVANS were quickly checking through notes, notebooks and papers
in SIRHAN's room. SA SULLIVAN did not participate in the search
but merely observed the search as being conducted by Sergeant
BRANDT and Detective EVANS. Sergeant BRANDT did show certain
items to SA SULLIVAN. These were two notebooks and the front
of one envelope.

At approximately 12:00 noon Sergeant BRANDT, Detective
EVANS, ADEL SIRHAN and SA SULLIVAN left the SIRHAN residence
and drove directly to the Rampart Division Station. The two
notebooks and the envelope were taken by Sergeant BRANDT and
it is not known if he gave a receipt or an inventory listing to
ADEL SIRHAN or anyone else. After arriving at the Rampart
Station SA SULLIVAN left to telephone the Los Angeles Office
of the FBI to advise of the developments outlined above. After
using the telephone SA SULLIVAN joined Sergeant BRANDT and
others in another part of the building. SA SULLIVAN observed
Mayor SAM YORTY in the room where the interview was being
conducted examining the notebooks and material obtained by
Sergeant BRANDT and Detective EVANS from the SIRHAN residence.

SA SULLIVAN inquired of Lieutenant CHARLES HUGHES,
Chief of Detectives of the Rampart Division, if the material
obtained at the SIRHAN residence could be obtained for submission
to the FBI Laboratory for examination. Lieutenant HUGHES
instructed LEE SMITH, LAPD, to examine each page and then
inventory the material and turn it over to the FBI.

The weapon taken from SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN at the
time of the shooting of Senator KENNEDY and the other indivi-
duals at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, was determined
py the Los Angeles Police Department to be a .22 caliber
Iver Johson pistol, bearing serial number H53725. The Los
Angeles Police Department advised that this pistol contained
eight shots and that all eight shots were expended.

Los Angeles Police Department records under
DR 68521466 reflect that this gun was traced by the Homicide
Division of the Los Angeles Police Department on June 5, 1968

According to this report, information was received
by the Los Angeles Police Department from Criminal Identifi-
cation and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, which indicated
that this particular weapon was registered to an ALBERT
LESLIE HERTZ of 777 East Valley Boulevard, Apartment 32,
Alhambra, California, telephone number 289-3311. CII records
reflected that this gun was purchased on August 10, 1965, in
Pasadena.

Further, the Los Angeles Police Department report
reflects that, on June 5, 1968, Mr. and Mrs. ALBERT L.
HERTZ were interviewed concerning this weapon. They stated
that this particular gun had been purchased in August of
1965 by Mr. HERTZ, Several months later, Mrs. HERTZ gave
this gun to her daughter, DANA. DANA was identified by Mrs.
HERTZ to be DANA WESTLAKE who currently resides at 349
Redwood Drive in Woodacre, California, telephone number
415 454-3202. Mrs. WESTLAKE resides at this location with
her husband, ROBERT F, WESTLAKE.

and informed the Los Angeles Police Department that Mrs.
WESTLAKE, while still living in Pasadena, California,

either in the latter part of November or the first part of
December 1967, gave this gun to a neighbor boy. She stated
that the boy was identical to GEORGE ERHARD of 1978 Olive
Way, Pasadena, California, 798-3957. Later on the morning
of June 5, 1968, the Los Angeles Police Department con-
tacted GEORGE ERHARD, who advised that Mrs. WESTLAKE gave
him the gun around the first of the year in 1968 and that
he had it only a very short time before he sold it. He.
stated that he sold the weapon to a person that works with
him at the Nash Department Store located in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia, on the northeast corner of Arroyo and Colorado
Streets. ERHARD stated that the individual to whom he sold
the gun was known only to him as JOE, whom he described as

a male, Latin in appearance, but he thought that the indivi-
dual was an Arab. ERHARD indicated to the police that he
could recognize and point out this individual he knew as
JOE, ERHARD was taken to the Nash Department Store in
Pasadena, where JOE, who was later identified as MUNIR SIRHAN,
“was taken into custody! At this time, according to the Los
Angeles Police Department report, officers received informa-
tion that ADEL SIRHAN"was also in custody’ at the Pasadena
