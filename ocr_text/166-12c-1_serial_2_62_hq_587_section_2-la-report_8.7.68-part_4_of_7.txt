MUNIR BISHARA SIRHAN was interviewed at his
residence, 696 East Howard, at which time he advised as
follows: .

MUNIR SIRHAN was arrested on a vagrancy charge
in Flagstaff, Arizona, in May of 1966, along with three or
four other individuals. He and DAVID MYERS had left
Los Angeles, California, together on a hitchhiking trip.
They had been acquainted with each other only two or three
weeks before their departure. MUNIR SIRHAN's brother,
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, was not acquainted with MYERS in any
manner,

The other individuals who were arrested at the
same time were not Known to MUNIR SIRHAN prior to the date
of the arrest. It was pointed out to Mr. SIRHAN that
apparently the Flagstaff, Arizona, Police records indicate
he was acquainted with PHILLIP LEE CLEVENGER and RONNIE
EDMON HOULEN who were arrested at the same time. Mr. SIRHAN
advised that this was inaccurate, as, in fact, he and MYERS
were traveling together, and they obtained a ride with the
others. He had not seen them before that date.

Mr. SIRHAN stated, without any qualification at
all, that his brother, SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, was in no
way acquainted with any of the above individuals.
