as having been in attendance at the above described meeting.
MARTINEZ said this individual also appeared to be waiting
for someone and that at approximately the same time he
recognized him, the Night City Editor had approached them
and asked them into his office. MARTINEZ said he immediately
told DUARTE about this individual he had observed in the
outer office and DUARTE had instructed him to locate this
individual in order to corroborate his story. MARTINEZ
said he had immediately gone back to where he had observed
this individual but was unable to locate him. He described

FRANKLIN DIEGO DENIS, 839 North Sycamore Street,
Los Angeles, California, residence telephone 464-5473, advised
he had attended a "Pro-Communist'" meeting held ofiMay 21,.. 1668,
at a private residence at 3800 Amesbury Road, Los Angeles,
California. DENIS stated he had received a telephone call
on the afternoon of May 21, 1968, from JOSE DUARTE, the
spokesman for UNARE (Unidad Nacional Revolucionaria), a
Cuban exile crganization. DUARTE advised him at that time
that a meeting was to take place at which a lecture would
be given and color slides shown by a student who had just
returned from a trip to Cuba.

DENIS advised he went to the meeting alone in his
own car, arriving about 9:00 PM, at which time he met with
other Cubans from DUARTE's group in front of the residence
at 3800 Amesbury Road. DUARTE went to the door of the
residence and spoke with a man and a woman, requesting
permission for he and his friends to attend the meeting.
They were given permission to attend the meeting; and DENIS
stated that all entered the house together. Upon entering
the front door, they were directed to a room off to the
right, in which ma chairs had been set up. On the wall of
this room was a large picture of the former Cuban revolutionary,
CHE GUEVARA,

DENIS stated the guest at this meeting, whose
name he could not recall, but who was allegedly a student
from San Francisco State College, had not yet arrived and
people were gathered about the room in small groups talking.
Shortly after 9:00 PM, the guest speaker arrived and DENIS
stated he took a seat near the back of the room. He estimated
there were approximately 50 or 60 people in attendance at
the meeting, about ten of whom were part of his group, who
had seated themselves in different locations throughout the
room.

DENIS advised the guest speaker gave a short
lecture concerning his tour of Cuba and followed this talk
by showing cclored slides of Cuba and gave a short monologue
with each picture. DENIS recalls that one slide in particular,
which depicted a monument in memory of the Bay of Pigs
invasion, had raised strong criticism from a friend of
DUARTE, named PEREIRA, who was a veteran of this invasion.
The guest speaker stated this invasion was made by
"mercenaries" and PEREIRA rose from his seat and shouted
that the invasion was made by "Cuban patriots fighting for
their country".

Following the showing of the slides, DUARTE, who
had been sitting in the front row, got up and demanded that
he be given equal time to present his views regarding Cuba.
DENIS stated that earlier in the meeting, when DUARTE
suggested that he be allowed to speak, a vote had been taken
and it had been decided that DUARTE would be allowed to
speak after the guest speaker. DENIS stated, however, that
as soon as DUARTE got up, people began talking and moving
about the room, and the meeting began to break up. Upon
seeing this, DENIS advised that he left the room and went
outside the house to wait in front for the rest of his
friends. DENIS said that a short while later, he had left
the house alone and returned home.

DENIS also stated that during the meeting, a
collection had been taken up by the organizers, who appeared
to be the owners of the house, to raise funds for the legal
defense of an individual in Oakland, California. DENIS
said he does not recall this individual's name nor the
charges against him.

DENIS continued that following the assassination
of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, he had heard from several
of his friends that the accused assassin, SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, had been recognized by DUARTE and others as having
peen in attendance at the above described meeting.

AMBROSIO REYES was interviewed at 10731 Palms Avenue,
his residence. He wags advised of the identity of the inter-
viewing Agent. He was interviewed in the Spanish language. His
prother, WILLIAM REYES, was present at time of interview.

REYES said that he is a Cuban and prior to the advent
of tne Castro regime in Cuba he was a union official in the
tobacco workers union in Havana, Cuba. After CASTRO came into
power, REYES left Cuba. REYES said he is strongly anti-communist
and has great regard for the United States as the last bastion
in the world of democracy.

REYES said in Havana, Cuba, he was superficially
acquainted with JOSE A. DUARTE and had no further contact with
DUARTE since then until several months ago, when he had contact
witn DUARTE in Los Angeles.

A few evenings prior to May 21, 1968, REYES was
contacted by anti-Castro Cubans in Los Angeles and it was
requected of him that he attend, with a group of Cubans, a
meeting that was to be held on May 21, 1968, at Los Angeles,
California, It was explained to him that at this meeting a
young student was to speak and show slides. The young student
has recently toured Cuba and according to the anti-Castro
Cubans, was going to present the situation in Cuba as very
favorable to CASTRO. The anti-Castro Cubans explained to
REYES that it was necessary for a group opposed to CASTRO to
go to this meeting and attempt to refute any pro-communist
statements.

On the evening of May 21, 1963, REYES proceeded with
other Cubans to a large home situated in Griffith Park. REYES
and the DUARTE group arrived about 9:00 p.m. Upon entering
the home, REYES observed numerous posters decrying United States
involvement in Vietnam. REYES also observed a very large
portrait of "CHE" GUEVARA. As this appeared to REYES to be
the site of a pro-communist gathering, he decided to take up
a position at the back of the meeting place to observe the
character of the attendance. REYES too: up a position on tne

ersons entering the vestibule and also could see into the living
room where the meeting was to be held.

“About 35 persons in all were present, of which about
12 persons represented tue DUARTE group. At tne inception of
the meeting, the young student who had toured Cuba was intro-
duced. REYES said that he does not recall this individual's
name. DUARTE then got up end requested that ne, DUARTE, be
granted time to present his views on Cuba. The persons present
voted to allow DUARTE to speak at the conclusion of the meet-
ing.

The Lights in the Living room of the home were turned
down and the student began to show colored slides of Cuba.
DUARTE, who felt that after the slides were shown he would not
be allowed to speak, tnen stood up and demanded the right to
speak at this time. A young man in a T-shirt and light color-
ed trousers approached DUARTE an:i began berating him. DUARTE
and tnis young man argued in English anc REYES did not know
what they said. Various people then gathered about DUARTE
and a heated discussion was held. REYES said to DUARTE, "Let's
get out of here, these people do not want to hear what you
have to say." It took additional urging upon the part of
REYES to get DUARTE and DUARTE's group to lecve. DUARTE,
REYES, and DUARTE's adherents subsequently left the home.

‘REYES said that he would describe the young man who
berated DUARTE as race undetermined but he was possibly Cuban
or Latin American ag he had a very swarthy complexion. REYES
further described thie individual as age 24 to 30, five foot
nine inches in height,. weighing about 140 pounds with black
curly hair. REYES said that he never got e good look at this
individuals face. REYES was displayed two photographs of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN; one photograph being the photograph of SIRHAN
surrounced by various pergons who were holding him and one
photograph of SIRHAN with booking number J 495 139. REYES said
that these photographs do not appear to be the young man who

SIRHAN in that medie does not appear to be identical with the

ESTEBAN FERNANDEZ .was interviewed at 9144 South
Kenmore, where he resides. He was interviewed in the
presence of his wife, RINA FERNANDEZ. He was” advised of the
identity of the interviewing agent. He was interviewed in
the Spanish language.

He said he was born in Cuba and lived there his
entire liffe. He completed high school in Cuba and was going
to attend the University in Havana but he left Cuba and came
to the United States in 1962. His wife had lived in the
United States for the past thirteen years. His father
is still in Cuba.

FERNANDEZ said that he is strongly anti-Communist
and he and other anti-Communist Cubans in the Los Angeles
area have felt it is their duty to attend Cuban meetings in
Los Angeles and insure that if pro-Communist views are voiced
at these meetings, there will be a representation of
Cubans present to refute pro-Communist claims. On the
evening of May 21, 1968, he, JOSE DUARTE, and others
attended a meeting in a private home in Griffith Park. An
American student who had recently toured Cuba, was to talk
about Cuba and was to show colored slides of Cuba.

Upon arrival at the private home,where the meeting
was to take place, FERNANDEZ became suspicious because he
observed posters of "CHE" GUEVARA and CASTRO on the walls
and there were also posters condemning United States
participation in the Vietnam war. There were a total of
about fifty persons present at the meeting, of which about
fifteen comprised DUARTE's group. At the beginning of the
meeting, DUARTE asked of the assemblage that he be allowed to
speak and present his views also and after some discussion
the assemblage voted to give DUARTE time to present his views.

The student showed his slides and after the slides
were over, DUARTE commenced to speak about the short-comings
of Communism. A number of; persons gathered about DUARTE
to discuss matters and one youth in particular became very
vehement and bexated DUARTE in English. This youth talked
very roughly to DUARTE but FERNANDEZ did not see any
scuffle between DUARTE and this youth. FERNANDEZ and
the DUARTE group subsequently left the premises.

FERNANDEZ said he would describe the youth who
approached DUARTE as age 24 to 25; height, 5'4", weight
O-145 pounds, with a slight build. His hair was very
curly and kinky. His complexion was very swarthy and dark
as is the complexion of a dark skinned Mexican. He was
dressed in shirt and trousers and not a suit. FERNANDEZ
said that although he does not understand English, at the
beginning of the meeting the youth said he was an Arab.

FERNANDEZ was displayed two ‘photos of SIRHAN“BISHARA °
SIRHAN, one bearing Los Angeles County Jail Booking Number
295139 and one photo of SIRHAN surrounded and being held by
various persons. FERNANDEZ identified the photos of SIRHAN
as being identical to the person who accosted DUARTE at the
Cuban meeting. FERNANDEZ also stated that when he saw the
photos of SIRHAN in the Los Angeles Times or the Herald~
Examiner, he immediately recognized him as the individual who
had accosted DUARTE at the meeting.

FERNANDEZ said that he feels very strongly that
the Communists are attempting to take over the United States
and he regards the assassination of ROBERT KENNEDY as a part
of this plot. He said he feels that although he did not agree
with all of Senator ROBERT KENNEDY's political views, Senator
KENNEDY was a great leader of the masses and the
Communists killed KENNEDY to deprive the masses of a
natural leader and thus weaken this country.

He said his feelings are further bolstered by the

fact that when the individual, whom he is sure is SIRHAN, was
perating DUARTE at the Cuban meeting, some of the bystanders

FRANK GUTIERREZ, 4810 Oakwood Avenue,
Los Angeles, was interviewed at this location and furnished
the following information:

He was born December 20, 1912, in Cuba. On the
evening of May 21, 1968, he and approximately ten other
Cuban individuals, including JOSE DUARTE, ALBERT VELAZCO,
FRANK MARTINEZ, FRANKLIN DENIS and EVIDIO PERETRA, attended
a meeting at 3300 Amesbury, Los Angeles. He believes that
VELAZCO had a pamphlet announcing this meeting and a talk
on Cuba by (FNU) SHINOFF, an American student who recently
returned from a trip to Cuba. GUTIERREZ drove to the
residence at 3300 Amesbury with VELAZCO, who resides at
1409 North Edgemont, Los Angeles, arriving shortly before
9:00 p.m. GUTIERREZ believes that shortly after arriving
at this meeting, JOSE DUARTE approached the chairman of the
meeting, name unrecalled, and privately requested time to
present a talk regarding his former experiences in Cuba.
Following the talk on Cuba by the unknown American student,
DUARTE stood up and requested time to refute statements
favorable to FIDEL CASTRO made by the American student.

A number of persons became quite critical of DUARTE,

stating that he was not a scheduled speaker and should not
be allowed to present his views on Cuba. GUTIERREZ believes
that a vote was taken as to whether to allow DUARTE to speak,
and it was ultimately decided that DUARTE could talk after
the slide presentation by the American student.

Following this slide presentation, DUARTE stood
up and spoke for approximately ten minutes. GUTIERREZ
recalled that ten or fifteen individuals left the meeting
immediately before and during DUARTE's talk. Many of those
who remained repeatedly criticized statements by DUARTE, and
although the meeting remained orderly, the audience was quite
noisy. GUTIERREZ recalls one individual in particular who
got up from his chair and confronted DUARTE at the front of the
room, GUTIERREZ described this individual as being dark

GUTIERREZ does not recall specific comments made by this
individual but believes he accused DUARTE of working for

DUARTE and this individual became quite loud, at no time

did GUTIERREZ observe any kind of a scuffle.

GUTIERREZ was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA

ROBERT LAEMMLE, 2300 Amesbury, Owner, Regent
Theater, West Los Angeles, California, was interviewed at
his residence and furnished the following information:

On May 21, 1963, a public meeting of the Los
Feliz Peace and Freedom Party (LFPFP) was held at his
residence, 2300 Amesbury, which location he frequently makes
available for such meetings. This meeting began at
approximately 3:15 a.m, and lasted until shortly before
midnight.

Pamphlets announcing this meeting and a talk on
Cuba by PAUL HUGH SHINOFF were distributed in the Los Angeles
area, and the meeting was advertised in the Los Angeles
"Pree Press" newspaper. According to LAEMMLE, the meeting
was definitely not pro Cuban.

Most of the approximately 65 persons attending
the meeting were unknown to LAEMMLE, and LAEMMLE indicated
that the LFPFP members would be known by RON SCHNEIDERS,
Chairman of the LFPFP, LAEMMLE believes SCHNEIDERS arranged
SHINOFF's Cuban presentation.

A group of ten to fifteen persons headed by JOSE
DUARTE, previously unknown to LAEMMLE, attended this meeting.
DUARTE and four or five of his followers set in the front
portion of the room, while DUARTE's other companions stood
toward the rear.

As PAUL SHINOFF, who arrived at approximately
9:00 p.m., began to talk on Cuba, one of DUARTE!'s companions
in the rear of the room raised his voice to criticize a comment
py SHINOFF. DUARTE, speaking in Spanish, quieted this individual
py telling him to respect the rights of the speaker.

As SHINOFF was preparing his slide presentation
at approximately 10:00 p.m., DUARTE stood up and demanded
time to give a "formal" presentation of his views on Cuba
and negate statements made by SHINOFF. A noisy debate followed

and the question of whether DUARTE should be allowed to
speak was put to a vote. In a close vote, DUARTE was given
permission to speak, but only after SHINOFF presented his
slides. SHINOFF then presented his slides on Cuba, and

the audience remained orderly, with members of DUARTE's
group frequently offering assistance in identifying various
puildings and monuments depicted in the slides on Cuba.

Following the slide presentation, DUARTE stood
up and started histalk, The audience was not receptive
to DUARTE, more because of his demanding attitude than
his viewson Cuba, and approximately 2O persons left the
meeting. LAEMMLE acknowledged that those who did remain
for DUARTE's talk were noisy but orderly. At no time did
any scuffle take place. LAEMMLE does not recall observing
anyone resembling news media photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN at the meeting and cannot recall anyone in particular
arguing with DUARTE or calling DUARTE a CIA agent.

LAEMMLE recalls that his wife, RAQUEL LAEMMLE,
who also attended this meeting, told him after the meeting
that as the meeting began to break up, three dark complected
male individuals walked past her and appeared startied as
they noticed a Star of David on a chain around her neck,
According to LAEMMLE, his wife has speculated that these
three individuals could have been Arabs, because of their
reaction upon observing the Star of David. LAEMMLE did
not see or hear anything else which might indicate that anyone
present at the meeting was of Arab extraction. LAEMMLE
vaguely recalls two or three individuals seated toward the
front of the room who might be identical to the three
individuals referred to by his wife but was unable to further
describe these individuals. Although he believes these three
individuals were critical of DUARTE, he cannot recall any
statements they made.

Photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN were shown to
LAEMMLE, and after viewing these photographs, LAEMMLE advised
that he cannot recall anyone resembling these photographs
who attended the above meeting.

LAEMMLE, hosted an open meeting sponsored by the Los hes
Peace and Freedom Party (LFPFP) at their residence,

arrived at the-meeting. LAEMMLE believes these individuals
arrived at approximately 9:00 p.m. but could not recall
whether they arrived before or-after SHINOFF, who also
arrived at approximately 9:00 p.m. Following a talk by
SHINOFE, and as SHINOFF was preparing a slide presentation,
DUARTE stood up and demanded that he be given time to
present his views on Cuba. According to LAEMMLE, a noisy .
but orderly discussion followed, and a vote was taken as to.
whether DUARTE should be allowed to speak since he was not
previously announced as a speaker. Those present voted to-
allow DUARTE to speak following SHINOFF's slide presentation.
‘Following SHINOFF's slide presentation, DUARTE stood up again
and started his talk. Between fifteen and twenty individuals

arguing with DUARTE or call DUARTE a CIA agent. She feels
that the audience as a whole was more critical of DUARTE
because of his attitude. than his views on Cuba,

LAEMMLE cannot recall observing anyone at the
meeting who resembled news media photographs of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN. She recalled that as the meeting adjourned
one tall and two short dark complected individuals, who
she believes arrived shortly after the meeting started,
walked past her and hesitated when they observed a large
Star of David which she was wearing on a chain around her
neck. Recalling this incident, LAEMMLE suggested that
these three individuals could have been Arabs in view of
their reaction upon observing the Star of David.

LAEMMLE did not see or hear anything else which
would indicate that anyone at the meeting was of Arab
extraction. She does not recall the dress of any of these
three individuals or any remarks made by same.

Photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN were shown
to LAEMMLE, and, after viewing these photographs, LAEMMLE
advised she is certain that none of the above three
individuals or anyone else sne observed at the meeting
resembles these photographs of SIRHAN,

Amesbury, Los Angeles, the residence of ROBERT and RAQUEL
LAEMMLE., This meeting was chaired by her husband, RON

recalled that SHINOFF arrived at approximately 9:00 p.m.
and that shortly thereafter a group of approximately ten
Cuban individuals, headed by JOSE DUARTE, previously unknown
to SCHNEIDERS, arrived at this meeting. Although SCHTEIDERS
spent much of her time preparing and serving refreshments
at this meeting, she recalls that following a talk and slide
presentation by SHINOFF, DUARTE stood up and spoke for
petween five and ten minutes. The audience became quite
agitated with DUARTE, and although there was considerable
shouting, SCHNEIDERS does not believe that any kind of a
scuffle took place. SCHNEIDERS recalls observing two or
three dark complected individuals, all having dark wavy hair,
who were seated toward the front of the room and who, along
with the others seated toward the front, shouted criticism
at DUARTE as this individual attempted to speak, SCHNEIDERS
does not recall any particular remarks made by these individuals

SA RAYSA that SCHNEIDERS' apartment contained a large poster
of ERNESTO "CHE" GUEVARA bearing the inscription "Viva Che,"
several small anti-Vietnam war posters, and several
posters reading "Free Huey." On numerous occasions during
the interview, SCHNEIDERS made comments critical of the
Los Angeles Police Department and its handling of the
Los Angeles area anti-Vietnam war demonstrations, and its
harassment of members of the Mexican-American community.

SCHNEIDERS acknowledged he is Chairman of the
Los Feliz Peace and Freedom Party (LFPFP) and that on
May 21, 1968, he chaired an open meeting sponsored by the
LFPFP at 3800 Amesbury, Los Angeles, and lasting from

approximately 8:15 p.m. to shortly before midnight. SCHNEIDERS

estimates 60 to 70 persons attended this meeting, including
approximately 15 LFPFP members and approximately 10 Cuban
individuals, who arrived at approximately 9:15 p.m. ina

group headed by JOSE DUARTE, previously unknown to SCHNEIDERS.

Los Angeles City College. Both announcements referred to a
talk on Cuba by PAUL HUGH SHINOFF who had recently returned
from a trip to Cuba. SHINOFF's presence was arranged by
SCHNEIDERS.

SCHNEIDERS introduced SHINOFF at approximately
9:00 p.m. and shortly thereafter DUARTE and his followers
arrived. DUARTE approached SCHNEIDERS and requested time to
discuss his views on Cuba and to refute any statements
favorable to CASTRO made by SHINOFF. During SHINOFF's talk

Following the SHINOFF talk, DUARTE stood up before the
audience and demanded that he be given time to speak before
the presentation of slides on Cuba by SHINOFF. A noisy
debate followed, and SCHNEIDERS called for a vote ag to
whether DUARTE should be allowed to speak. A vote resulted
in a tie, and SCHNEIDERS told DUARTE he could speak but

only after the slide presentation. SCHNEIDERS then requested
the audience to remain seated following the slides for a talk
by DUARTE. Following the slide presentation, DUARTE stood

up and spoke for approximately 10 minutes The audience
became quite agitated and critical of DUARTE, but SCHNEIDERS
does not recall any statements made. SCHNEIDERS did recall
that someone asked DUARTE why he left Cuba; that DUARTE
replied that he was forced to leave because of his opposition
to the CASTRO government; and that an elderly woman, who
SCHNEIDERS refused to identify, then accused DUARTE of being
a CIA Agent.

SCHNEIDERS was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA

SIRHAN, including a June 5, 1968, Log Angeles Police Department
photograph and a photograph depicting a profile view of SIRHAN.
After viewing these photographs, he advised that he did not

observe anyone at the meeting resembling the individual
depicted in these photographs. SCHNEIDERS vaguely recalls’
observing an unknown dark complected white male individal,
wearing a T-shirt, who stood toward the front of the room
during the slide presentation, but was unable to further
describe thig individual or recall whether he resembled the
STRHAN photographs. SCHNEIDERS did not. see this individual
arrive or leave the meeting and did not see or hear anything
which might indicate that he was of Arab extraction.

SCHNEIDERS noted that approximately one week ago
he received a call from a female acquaintance who told him
that a second female acquaintance, who attended the above
meeting, had stated that SIRHAN SIRHAN had attended this
meeting. SCHNEIDERS, who refused to identify either of these
female individuals, gave this information to JIM OSBORN ,
a friend and reporter for the Log Angeles "Free Press! newspaper.
According to SCHNEIDERS, OSBORN contacted this second female
individual, and the latter became very angry and denied ever
making such a statement.

PAUL GROSSBERG, 4316 Finley, Hollywood, telephone
665-4924, was contacted at his residence and furnished the
following information:

GROSSBERG described himself as a liberal and anti-
communist in his political beliefs. On the evening of
May 21, 1963, GROSSBERG attended a meeting sponsored by the
Los Feliz Peace and Freedom Party (LFPFP), which meeting
included a talk and slide presentation on Cuba by PAUL
SHINOFF, This meeting was held at 2300 Amesbury, Los
Angeles, the residence of ROBERT and RAQUEL LAEMMLE, and
was chaired by RON SCHNEIDERS, who is Chairman of the LFPFP.
According to GROSSBERG, approximately 60 persons attended
this meeting, and only a small number of those present were
members of the LFPFP, A group of approximately ten Cuban
individuals, including JOSE DUARTE, unknown to GROSSBERG
prior to this meeting, also attended the meeting.

GROSSBERG recalled that he arrived at this meeting
petween 9:20 and 10:00 p.m., at which time SHINOFF was
concluding his talk on Cuba and preparing to present his
slides. Shortly after GROSSBERG arrived, a Cuban individual,
subsequently identified to GROSSBERG as JOSE DUARTE, stood
up and requested time to present his views on Cuba. A loud
debate followed DUARTE's request to speak, with many of
those present apparently feeling that DUARTE should not be
allowed to speak since he was not a scheduled speaker.
GROSSBERG noted that he favored allowing DUARTE to speak
and that he was probably as noisy as anyone else at this
point in criticizing those who opposed a talk by DUARTE.
Those present finally voted to allow DUARTE to speak but
only after SHINOFF finished his slide presentation.

GROSSBERG described SHINOFF's presentation as
extremely one-sided and definitely pro-CASTRO. During the
slide presentation, several of DUARTE's companions criticized
SHINOFF's interpretation of economic and reform programs
promulgated under FIDEL CASTRO, This criticism, which

remained orderly, included statements to the effect that
virtually all of the reforms spoken of by SHINOFF were
instituted before CASTRO assumed leadership in Cuba.
GROSSBERG further recalls that one of the slides depicted
a prison in Cuba and that SHINOFF claimed that CASTRO
frequently visited this prison as a gesture of good will,
even though it contained his (CASTRO's) political enemies.
Following this claim by SHINOFF, one of DUARTE's Cuban
companions stated that he had spent considerable time in
this particular prison and had never known CASTRO to visit
it.

Following SHINOFF's slide presentation, DUARTE
spoke for between ten and fifteen minutes, repeatedly
referring to how CASTRO had betrayed the revolution. A
number of persons left the meeting as DUARTE got up to
speak. GROSSBERG indicated that although most of those
who remained for DUARTE's talk were quiet, six or seven
individuals continually criticized DUARTE's statements.
GROSSBERG stated that although he is not acquainted with
these individuals, he would describe them as "leftists,"
based wpon their actions at this meeting, and at several
other meetings of the LFPFP meetings which they attended.
GROSSBERG does not recall any specific comments made by
these individuals. He vaguely recalls“a statement accusing
DUARTE of being a CIA agent, and believes this statement was
made by an individual seated in the center of the room who
inguired why DUARTE left Cuba. GROSSBERG feels that DUARTE
probably aggravated this criticism by shouting back whenever
one of these individuals made a comment. GROSSBERG stated
that although DUARTE and the above individuals argued
_vigormsly, each returning the shouts of the others, at no
time did any kind of a scuffle take place,

GROSSBERG indicated that as DUARTE finished his
talk, he (GROSSBERG) went to the front of the room and talked
briefly with this individual, thanking him for coming to the
meeting. DUARTE gave GROSSBERG his telephone number and told
GROSSBERG that if he (GROSSBERG) ever wanted him to speak
again, he could be contacted at this number.

NALDI recalled that following a talk on Cuba
by PAUL SHINOFF, JOSE DUARTE stood up before the audience
and requested time to present his views and refute statements
made by SHINOFF, The audience became quite noisy, and the
question of whether DUARTE should be allowed to speak was
put to a vote. She believes that those present voted to
allow DUARTE to speak following the SHINOFF slide presentation.

NALDI further recalled that during the slide
presentation, she became aware of a slightly built white
male individual seated in a row of chairs in front of
double doors leading to an outdoor patio approximately
ten feet from the front of the room. NALDI further described
this individual as youthful in appearance, between 18 and 19
years of age, 515" tall, dark curly unkempt hair, medium to
dark complexion and wearing a white T-shirt and jeans. She
had néver seen this individual before and assumed that he
was of Latin American extraction because of his dark complexion.

NALDI recalled that as a slide depicting traffic
congestion in Cuba was presented, one of the Cuban individuals
remarked in jest, "There's my car," and that the above
T-shirted individual commented to the effect that only the

Toward the end of DUARTE's talk, this T-shirted individual
became very excited and angry, got up from his seat and
proceeded to within several feet of DUARTE. DUARTE and this
individual argued back and forth in loud voices, but NALDI
does not recall what was said. She did not observe any kind
of a seuffle between DUARTE and this individual. The
meeting adjourned for coffee several minutes after this

this point and did not further observe the above T-shirted

that the latter individual appeared lighter complected

NALDI, who sat next to ERNA BUDZISLAWSKI, 2040

toward the end of the meeting, BUDZISLAWSKI nodded toward
an elderly, well-dressed man standing on one side of the

not believe that anyone else heard the comment. She did

a Federal Bureau of Investigation automobile at the intersection
of Market and Beale Streets, San Francisco, California. SHINOFF
related that he will be in San Francisco for several weeks, after
which he may possibly return to Southern California.

SHINOFF related that he attended a meeting of the Los Feliz

out advertising this meeting and consequently there were possibly
fifty to sixty individuals present in the private home of a couple
whose names he was unable to recell. During this meeting SHINOFF
spoke concerning his recent trip to Cuba and also showed slides on
Cuba.

SHINOFF recalled that during his talk an individual, whose
name he later learned to be DUARTE, rose and demanded to speak.
This interruption led to a heated discussion by various individuals
pro and con regarding DUARTE’s speaking to the group. It was
finally decided that DUARTE should be allowed to speak after
SHINOFF hed finished showing the slides. SHINOFF related that he
did not recall any individual scuffling with DUARTE or any parti-
cular individual making derogatory remarks concerning DUARTE. He
further claimed that he could not recall a small dark individual
who was dressed in T-shirt and trousers being present at this meet-
ing.

SHINOFF was shown two photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA STRUAN

GERALD LIGHT GOLDSTEIN, 649A Hawthorne, Glendale,
California, was interviewed at this location and furnished
the following information:

Although currently unemployed, he is a free-lance
photographer and occasionally sells photographs to the
Los Angeles area newspapers.

Between midnight and 12:10 a.m. on June 5, 1963,
he arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, for the
purpose of taking photographs of a reception for Senator
ROBERT F, KENNEDY. GOLDSTEIN proceeded to the Embassy Room
at the hotel, and, shortly after arriving at this location
was told that Senator KENNEDY had just been shot in another
area of the hotel. GOLDSTEIN then proceeded to the area of
the shooting and took several photographs of the persons
who had been shot. Several days later he gave this film
to the "Free Press newspaper. GOLDSTEIN did not see the actual
shooting of Senator KENNEDY or the person responsible for
the shooting.

GOLDSTEIN also advised that on May 21, 1968, he
attended a meeting sponsored by the Los Feliz Peace and
Freedom Party (LFPFP) at 3300 Amesbury, Los Angeles, which
meeting included a talk and slide presentation on Cuba by
PAUL SHINOFF. GOLDSTEIN, who is a member of the LFPFP,
arrived at the meeting at approximately 9:20 p.m. As
SHINOFF was preparing to present his slides of Cuba, a
Cuban individual, subsequently identified to GOLDSTEIN
as Major JOSE DUARTE, stood up and requested that he be
given time to present his views on Cuba. The meeting
became quite loud, and GOLDSTEIN believes that those present
voted to allow DUARTE to speak following SHINOFF's slide
presentation. After the presentation of these slide§ which
slides GOLDSTEIN described as being of very poor quality,
DUARTE again stood up at the front of the room and proceeded
to present his views on Cuba. The audience again became
quite noisy and critical of DUARTE. GOLDSTEIN was unable to

identify any particular individuals arguing with DUARTE,
nor could he recall any of the comments made by these
individuals. He did not hear anyone accuse DUARTE of being
a CIA Agent and did not observe anyone scuffle with this
individual.

GOLDSTEIN was shown photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, including a photograph taken June 5, 1963, by the
Los Angeles Police Department. After viewing these photographs,
GOLDSTEIN advised he could not recall observing anyone at
the above meeting, or at the Ambassador Hotel on the morning
of June 5, 1968, who resembled these photographs.

GOLDSTEIN noted that several weeks ago, RON
SCHNEIDERS, Chairman of the LFPFP, mentioned that one of the
other LFPFP members who attended the above May 21, 1968,
meeting told him (SCHNEIDERS) that an individual resembling
SIRHAN attended this meeting. GOLDSTEIN, however, does not
know the identity of this ILFPFP member.
