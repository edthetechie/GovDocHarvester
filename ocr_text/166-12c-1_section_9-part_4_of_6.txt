The investigation the assassination of Senator
Robert F. Kennedy was, 9° “the best of our knowledge, fully

Sir:

As you will note from the enclosed
clipping, William F. Buckley, Jr.
interviewed Mr. Allard Lowenstein
on the former's Firing Line TV
program.

It appeared to me that there are

a number of areas of further inves-—
tigation which should be persued in
the death of Robert F. Kennedy.

Many of these considerations would
involve test-firing of several guns
and the examination of some lighting
panels, etc., as there may have been
as many as ten bullets fired,

Supposedly these tests and obser-
vations would require a minimum of
time and effort, yet there is a
reluctance on the part of the Los
Angeles District Attorney to re-
solve the questions that have been
raised.

Therefore I urge you to encourage
the LAPD and the DA to reexamine
the evidence and clarify the points
that were discussed on the program.

very truly_yours, a

Dear President Ford:

Last night former Congressman Allard Lowenstein appeared
on William F. Buekley's FIRING LINE program, He made a very ocompédling
ease that there are certain unanswered questions related to the proseeution
theory of the R. F. Kennedy murder. He identified a few simple tests of the
physical evidenee whieh would go a long way toward resolving these problems
one way or the other. He did not appear to be a wild-eyed "kook". He
and others attempting to resolve these questions have run into a stone wall
of bureaucratic resistance. W. F. Buekley, a natural seeptie if there wver
was one, was convineed of the need to try to resolve these questions.

Apparently, the Attorney General of the U. S. has the
authority to break-up the bureaucratic log jam. Will you instruet him to

help resolve wee uneertainties in this very important ease?

Dear Mr. Sullivan:

I am hereby requesting under Section 241 Title 18 of
the U. S. Code} and under other applicable laws, that you
- proceed immediately to prosecute all persons responsible
for the conspiracy to violate the civil rights of Sirhan
B. Sirhan who is being held in San Quentin prison for a
murder for which he was not responsible.

Information available to me shows that Senator
Robert F. Kennedy lived until July 19, 1969 at which
time he died by drowning on Chappaquiddick Island in
Massasachusetts. .

The alleged murder of Robert Kennedy was on June 5:
1968. Mr. Sirhan could not possibly have killed th
Senator under these circumstances. 4

All information which I possess to substantiate my
charge will be made available to you at your request.

Please advise me of your action as soon as possible.

Very truly yours,

“THE CHAPPAQUIDDICK COVERUP

In the early morning hours of July 19, 1969, a Deputy Sheriff
named Christoper Look was driving home, travelling east on Chap-
paquiddick road from the Edgartown Ferry on Chappaquiddick Island
in Massachusetts. Look came to a sharp right turn in the road,

where the road intersected a dirt road called Dike Road, which con-

tinued straight in the same direction Look was travelling.

: Look slowed to make the right turn and he noticed a car dri-
ving northeast on School Road toward him at the same intersection.
As Look stowed to almost a‘stop, the other car, instead of neg- .
otiating the turn on to Chappaquiddick Road toward Edgartown,drove
straight ahead and stopped on a narrow sand road leading to a ce-
metery. As the car passed in-front of Look's headlights, he saw

Ait was a black sedan and that there appeared to be a man and a

the rear.

. Look turned the corner and stopped about sixty feet from the
other car, stepped out of his station wagon and walked back along
the center line toward the car which was stopped at the entrance
to the ancient cemetery. As he was about thirty-five feet away,
the car quickly reversed, made a 90° right turn and headed towards
Dike Bridge and the beach, the car disappeared at high speed in a
cloud of dust. It was approximately 12:45 AM. . .

The black sedan travelled three-quarters of a mile and, at
high speed, struck some ruts in the road in front of the wooden
bridge, lost control and flipped over the right side into about
nine feet of water. The car came to rest with the engine toward
the bridge and the rear of the car at an elevated position. The
two occupants of the car were upSide down with water pouring into
the only open window next the the driver's left arm. The driver
drowned almost immediately and the young girl scrarnled into the
rear seat as the water rose around her. She soon yiscovered that
in the upside down position, the elevated section of the floor of
the rear section of the car trapped sufficient air that, by grasp-

ing the upside down seat, she was able to breathe. 4

The position of her drowned companion prevented her escape

from the only open window; and she survived for approximately

two hours. Shortly before 3 AM, of thereabouts, she expired from
shock, exposure and lack of oxygen. . . .

The girl was identified as Mary Jo Kopechne, secretary to

- Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who alledgedly was murdered by Sirhan

earlier... - Spt . . . ot

Both windows on the passenger side, which were smaller and
did not receive such a force as did the windshield, were broken
out to their frames.

Who was responsible for removing the glass from these windows?
What was the purpose? Was the driver's body removed in the night
and if so why was Miss Kopechne left inside: the car?

At approximately 9 AM, the same morning, a strange conver-
sation occured at the Edgartown Ferry crossing at the time the
paramedic was taking the body from the submerged car.

Three men boarded the ferry for the short trip across the
narrow strait joining Edgartown Harbor with Katama Bay. , -.

When the ferry docked at the Chappaquiddick terminal, one*

‘of the men, Mr. Tony Bettencourt, went up to Senator Ted Ken-

Indices of the Los Angeles Division of the FBI
indicate that from 1964 to the present, Mr. Thomson has
made -numerous complaints to this division of the FEI, by
telephone, mail, or in person. Most of these complaints have
dealt with the theme that President John F. Kennedy was not
shot in Dallas, Texas; that Senator Robert F. Kennedy was not
killed at the Ambassador Hotel, in Los Angeles; that there was
an erroneous identification in the shooting of Governor
George C. Wallace; and that attempted aircraft hijackings from
1970 through March 1972 were the responsibility of Arab
Guerrillas. Additional information from several different
individuals indicates that they too were contacted by Mr.
Thomson with similar complaints.

On October 12, 1964, Thomson telephonically contacted
the Los Angeles Division of the FBI at which time he wanted
to report he had in his employment a man from South America
whose name he felt the FBI should have in its files. He
said he considered the individual completely loyal to the
United States but “in view of his foreign connections" thought
his name should be in the possession of the FBI. At that time
Thomson continued, “Sometimes I think the Russians are reading
my mind, because things I think in solitude I read later in
the mwspapers."

In the fall of 1967, a United States Senator
furnished the FBI with a copy of a communication from Thomson
in which the latter indicated that after three years investigation
he had satisfied himself "that the insane lunatic who shot
and killed at least six people that day" (the day President
Kennedy was shot in Dallas) was none other than the then
Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson. Thomson's letter
continued, "Let the Department of Justice state publicly
that I am wrong. To_ bad, They do not dare to beacuse they
cannot. They have the power, but I have the truth."

On July 30, 1970, George C. Thomson called this
office to advise tht based on his analysis of the autopsy of
the victim of the shooting at the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles, he was of the opinion that Senator Robert F.
Kennedy was not dead, and that Sirhan B. Sirhan was not

ilty. He said he based his conclusions on the alleged
paths of the bullets and the direction in which they were

supposed to have been fired.

On August 6, 1970, another source who has furnished
reliable information in themst, reported that he had
overheard George C. Thomson state publicly, "President
John F. Kennedy was never assass inated in Dallas, Texas. The
person shot in that car was a JFK double."

SIRHAN B. SIRHAN - VICTIM

During an interview in connection with
another official investigation in May 1974, the person being
interviewed reported he had received a telephone call during
the morning of May 21, 1974, by an individual who introduced
himself as George Thomson, Consulting Engineer, of Glendale,
California. This source questioned Thomson's mental
stability, on the basis of allegations the latter made
regarding "a conspiracy by the FBI and the police to do away
with the Symbionese Liberation Army", a characterization
of which is appended hereto, and Thomson's comment on
"thought control." He said that Thomson had indicated he
became aware of a "new medical theory regarding ‘thought
control" which involved a surgical technique applied onto an
ear.

SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was reportedly
formed in the Summer of 1973, in California. An SLA
document captioned, "Declaration of Revolutionary War and
the Symbionese Program," dated 8/21/73, states" . . . Therefore,
we of the Symbionese Federation of the SLA. . . do now, by :
the rights of our children and people and by force of arms
and with every drop of our blood, declare revolutionary war
against the fascist, capitalist class. We support by
force of arms the just struggles of all oppressed people
for self-determination and independence within the
United States and the world, and hereby offer to all
liberation movements, revolutionary workers' groups and
peoples' organizations our total aid and support for the
struggle for freedom and justice for all people and races .. .
The SLA has claimed credit for the 11/6/73 assassination of
Dr. Marcus Foster, Oakland, California, School Superintendent;
the 2/4/74 kidnaping of Patricia Campbe 1 Hearst, daughter
of newspaper publisher-owner Randolph A. Hearst; and the
4/15/74 rebbery of the Hibernia Bank, San Francisco,
California, in the furtherance of its revolutionary
objectives, Six members of the SLA were involved in a
shoot-out with the FBI and Los Angeles, California, police
on 5/17/74, resulting in their deaths, Although no
current information has been developed indicating the
group has been active in areas other than California, other
groups and individuals have surfaced claiming adherence
to the SLA's revolutionary tenets.

Dear Mr. McCollister,

Something has just come to my attention that I think is of the
utmost importance regarding the future of the United States of America,
and every man, woman, and child living in it. Please do not take light.
ly what I am about to say. Iam not a "nut" or political "screwball"
and am writing to you as I don't know who else will listen and be able
to take action.

About five minutes ago my wife and I finished watching the “Tom
Snyder prgram", "TOMORROW" and the subject was the Robert Kennedy

-assasination. Toms guest was a Mr. Al Lowenstein, I believe he is

an attourney, and a man who I believe is the District Attorney for
the city of Los Angeles, California, Mr. Joe Busche

_ Mr. Lowenstein has what I feel are some very good questions re-
garding the assasination, pertaining to inaccuracies in the investigation.
One of the points was, “How come there are twelve different bullet holes
both in persons and building when the revolver used capacity was only
eight rounds?" “Why are there two different bullet types in those
recovered if in fact only one gun was used"? "If in fact Sen. Kennedy
was shot three times from the rear at a very close range,(one or two
inches) why did the witnesses, over fifty, not see Sirhan behind him
but rather from two to four feet as per testimony?" Mr. Lowenstein
had what I feel are more questions that seem to be unanswered. Until
this point in the program it was, just plain interesting.

Mr. Busch was in California and not in the New York studios so
a telephone hook-up was utilized with the purpose Mr. Busch as a key
figure in this investigation and trial, answer some of these questhons.
Cbviously, Mr. Busch and Mr. Lowenstein have encountered before because
the very first thing Mr. Busch 41d was to throw a critical remark toward
Mr. Lowenstein. Mr. McCollister, the thing that really has me literally
"shook-up* is the fact that Mr, Busch could not answer even one of Mr.
Lowensteins questions, not one. All Mr. Busch did was to re-assert the
decisions as they had come out, all the time being in my opinion very

defensive about himself and his department.

ter, I do not write to my congressman regularly. In
fact Mee eee you once a year ago regarding the fuel crisis and its
effect on general aviation of which I am apart. I never expected a
reply from you but I got one and for that I think you are one hell of
aman, Thanks. Please take some kind of action to get this assasination
case re-opened. There is just ro° much unanswered that tunis ace it

ion on m arte an elp you to ge s done
go by without ace veh Please let me hear from you once again

Shoul write to someone else?
and Task that it be as soon as possible. If you didn't see the program

obtain a tape from NBC and I think you too will be "shook-up".
