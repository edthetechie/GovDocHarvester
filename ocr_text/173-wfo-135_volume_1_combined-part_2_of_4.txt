Memorandum

TO 7 SAC, WFO (173-135) DATE: 6/6/68
FROM : ROBERT H, SYLVESTER, Clerk
SUBJECT: KENSALT

At 8:54pm, 6/6/68, a telephone call was receivéd from
an individual who identified himself as Dr ERA
who resides on a farm in Urbana, Maryland (Frederick Gounty),
telephone 301;874-2421, Dr, SCHIPPER said he is a rétired
dermatologist, He is a native of the Netherlands and has been
a naturalized American citizen since 1949, He advised as
follows: ,

During the evening of 6/6/68 he observed on television
a picture of the owner of the Organic Health Store, Pasadena,
where SIRHAN SIRHAN is alleged to have worked at one time, The
ner of the store was identified.on television as one JOHN_H, .
ELDNER. Dr. SCHIPPER immediately recognized WEIDNER as
an individual he knew as. JEAN H,/ WEIDNER, gr., during World j

War II, WEIDNER in 1943 operated a clothing store in Annecy,
Haute Savoy, France. This clgthing store was a clearing house
for members of the Dutch underground and other spies who
desired to go to Switzerland.

Dr. SCHIPPER was a civilian active in the Dutch under-
ground, Dr, SCHIPPER was jailed in Annecy, France during the
War. WEIDNER contacted SCHIPPER then and facilitated SCHIPPER's
escape,’ It is Dr, SCHIPPER's understanding that WEIDNER was
decorated by the Queen of Holland for his service to that
country.

Dr, SCHIPPER was aware that many operatives in the under-
ground during the War like WEIDNER were communists. Dr. SCHIPPER
never had any information that WEIDNER was a communist, however,

Dr, SCHIPPER last saw WHIDNER in 1944 or 1945 when
IDNER contacted him for assistance, Dr, SCHIPPER was then

working for the Dutch government.

Dr. SCHIPPER advised that although he hasn't seen WEIDNER
since 1944 or 1945, he immediately recognized his photograph on
television, and he is sure of the identification.

Dr. SCHIPPER suggested that complete details re WEIDNER's
background could probably be obtained from the files of the Dutch
Secret Service.

Dr. SCHIPPER said that he was bringing this matter to
the attention of the FBI not because he has any information there
is any connection with the assassination of Senator KENNEDY, but
because it is an "interesting coincidence,"

Dr. SCHIPPER offered his complete cooperation if the FBI
desires further details re his association with WEIDNER. He

suggested telephonic contact with him for the purposes of inter-
view arrangements,

WFO Indices were negative re the name JEAN H, WEIDNER, JR.,
or JOHN H, WEIDNER, Jr.

The only reference in WFO Indices re complainant's name
concerns one GERALD J, SCHIPPER (Dr.), WFOfile 100-33226-1105, p. 13.

" Reddin’ said an extensive
check had been made of files
of subversive organizations,
including those representing

- foreign nationals living in this

country. The suspect’s name.
had not turned up in any of
those files, the chief said.
Reddin said the case against
Sirhan now appears to beso
solid “that his investigators

plan no further interviews. He!

disclosed, however, that he
and the district attorney have
agreed that the suspect should
be. subjected to a psychologi-
cal test.

[Sirhan was considered by
acquaintances to be a “virulent
antiSemite,” Jerry Cohen of

the Los‘ Angeles Times re-}

‘ported. « :

quote Phdi as saying that
Sirhan’™may have been in-
flamed” by Sen. Kennedy’s
backing of the Israeli cause
during his TV debate with
Sen. Eugene S. McCarthy (D-
Minn,).

{“It is this disrespect for the
human Arab persén which
brings about this kind of vio-
lence,” Mehdi-said, He added
that Sirhan was active in the
Organization of Arab Students
while attending Pasadena
State College.

Un a formal statement
Mehdi said: “We condemn the
fact that Senator Kennedy had
kowtowed to the Zionist pres-
sure to the detriment of Amer-
ican interest in the Middle
East, as we condemn the act];
of Mr. Sirhan,”]

A swarthy, slender man,
Sirhan was arraigned in Los
Angeles Municipal Court this
morning: and then held in-the
Los Angeles County jail.

According to Lt. Jaek: Eber-|:

thardt, an execuliye aide to

iReddin, interrogators found
Sirhan articulate but adamant
in his refusal to discuss either
the shooting or his political
views.

“He’s banterlng with the in-
vestigators at this point,”
Eberhardt said. “He's flip.”

But Eberhardt said that Sir-
han talked eagerly about one
subject — a sensational local
murder case last year in which
a Los Angeles County deputy
district attorney was convicted
of killing his wife and her
lover. Sirhan brought up the
case several times and was in-
terested in whether the con-
victed murderer, Jack Kirshke,
would win freedom in his ap-
peal.

Sirhan was born March 19,
1944, in the Jordanian sector
of Jerusalem and entered the
United States through New

cording to the Imm on
and Naturalization Service.
He was then classed as a per-
manent residerit, the Service
said, but never became an
American citizen.

Both his first and last
names mean “wanderer”. in
Arabic.

Sirhan and two, brothers,
Munir (Joe) and ‘Adel, live
yith their mother, Mary Sir-
han, an employe of a Pasade-
na church nursery in Pasade-
na. There are unconfirmed re-
ports that his father returned
several years ago to an as yet
undetermined Arab country.

Sirhan Sirhan graduated in
1963. from John Muir High
School in Pasadena before go-
ing to Pasadena State. Accord-
ing .to the Los Angeles Times,
classmates considered him
“polite, clean and an A-1 stu-
dent.”

:Munir and Adel Sirhan were
being questioned by police late
in the day and were described
as “cooperative.”

Besides Munir and Adel, the
suspect has two other brothers
named Sharif and Saidallah. A
fifth brother is believed to

jexist but has not been identi-

fied so far.

A sister has died since en-
tering this country, Sirhan’s
father has returned to Jerusa-
lem, police said.

- The suspect had ham and
eges for breakfast and ate
heartily, police said.

Identification of Sirhan Sir-
han — who had refused
throughout the night to tell
police his name — was an-
nounced at a press’ conference
this morning by Los Angeles
Mayor Sam Yorty.

Mayor Yorty, in an off-the-
cuff television interview, dis-
closed during the afternoon
that police had found two
hand-written notebooks in the

York City Jan. 12, 1957, ac-jsuspect’s home and said they

contained “generally pro- >-Com-
munist writitigs.”

Yorty: said - ‘theswetabook i
writings ‘were in favor of}!
Egyptian President Nasser-and
strongly anti-Israeli and anti-
Kennedy. ;

Yorty also said an article
found among Sirhan’s belong-
ings in Pasadena declared that.
Kennedy should not be. al-
lowed té live after’ June 5
(first’ anniversary of the. Arab-
‘Israeli war). 1

Later, Reddin indicated that
he. thought Yorty should not

a.m. yesterday.

He was taken under heavy
police guard to the Los An-
geles Hall of Justice, where he
appeared before Municipal
Judge Joan Dempsey Klein.
Bail was set at $250,000 and a
public defender was called
into the case by the judge,
despite Sirhan’s insistence
that he did not want legal
counsel.

The record shows Sirhan is 5
feet, 4 inches tall, weighs
about 120 pounds, has a
swarthy complexion and wiry
or bushy hair, He was born
March 19, 1944, in a smail vil-
lage in Palestine,

At the time, the area was
ruled by Britain under the
League of Nations mandate.
With Britain’s ‘blessing, Jor-
dan became a kingdom in 1946.

mandate ended and the first
Arab-Israeli war was fought.

or said.

He said the notebooks con-
tained ‘many statements
about assassinating Sen. Rob-
ert F. Kennedy,” other com-
ments of a pro-Arab and anti-
Israel nature and some refer-
ences “saying the suspect is
sympathetic to communism,
whether it be Russian, Chinese
and 80 forth.”’ .

Finally, said the mayor,
there was a notation made in
one of the notebooks on either
May 17 or 18 which was ‘a
direct reference to the neces-
sity to assassinate Sen. Ken-
ndy before June 5, 1968.”

Those remarks by Yorty,
made at a press conference,
drew rebukes from both Red-
din ‘and A. L, Wirin, chief
counsel of the Southern Cali-
fornia chapter of the Ameri-
ean Civil Liberties Union, both
of whom implied that such
disclosures might be prejudi-
cial to Sirhan’s legal rights.

Sirhan was 12 years old
when his family entered this
country. He attended Longfel-
low Elementary School and
John Muir “High School in
Pasadena and attended Pasa-
dena City College. Several of
his high school classmates
described him as a good and
polite student.

But Frank Celis Jr., who
was in the sixth grade with
Sirhan, recalled yesterday
that “kids picked on him, tell-
ing him dirty words. He'd
repeat. them without knowing
what they meant.”

Still another classmate, a
girl who attended high school
with Sirhan but asked not to

be identified, recalled yester-

Quit After Argument

of the store,
worked for him about seven
months but quit last April in
an argument over money. “We
called him Sol around the
store; everyone did,” said
Weidner.

“He was a good worker, an
honest man, but he had a lot of
complexes, mainly relating to
Israel,’ added Weidner. “J
think he did it (shot Kennedy)
because he thought he was
doing something for his coun-
try, but not necessarily the
United States,” added Weid-
ner,

The store owner recalled
that Sirhan “told me. that
when he was a chiid, he saw
members of his family killed
by Jews, and he had to flee
Jordan when he was a child.”

“He was not a citizen and
didn’t like the United States.
You,had to be careful not td
walk] on his feet. He wanted
you jto -respect him intellec-
tually. He was a man who
said,’ ‘I’m going to have my
righjs.’ ” /
Sirhan was licensed in 1956

by thp California Racing Cor- ,
mission as a “hot walker” and.
“exercise boy” to cool off
horses which had become:,,
heated. by ‘running at Holly-
wood Park. He did not renew
that license in 1967 or 1968, but
apparently retained a strong
intérest in horse racing.
“He wanted to be a jockey,
and the people around the:
track advised him to get a job
on a farm where le could ex-
ercise horses and learn te
ride,” said John Shear, a co-
worker at Hollyweod Park..."

Reddin said the car be-
Jonged to a hotel employe who
worked in the kitchen where
Kennedy was shot. The em-
ploye was quoted by police as
saying he did not know Sirhan
and did not know how Sirhan
got the key.

Reddin discounted specula-
tion that others were involved
in the shooting. “We are now
reasonably sure that there’s
only one suspect,” he said yes-
terday.

Conspiracy Discounted
‘ The police chief also said he
did not read any “sinister in- -
ternational aspects into the
case — we still do not feel we -
are in a conspiratorial situa-
tion.” 7
He said a check of official *

Sirhan, Adel and Munir lived

to Reddin. "

Marijuana Conviction’ |

Munir was convicted on Oct,
12, 1966, in Superior Courfof
California on a state charge of
possession of marijuana. «He:
was sentenced: to five years’
probation. c

As a result of that incident,
the Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service initiated depor-
tation proceedings against him
in January 1967, and last July
a special inquiry officer order-
ed that Munir be deported,

However, Munir’ .appéaled
the case to the Board of Iniini-
gration Appeals, which. on
May 27 remanded the case
back to the special inquiry .of-
ficer for further investigation
because the California court
had set aside Munir’s guilty
plea and ordered that jdris-
diction be assumed by juvenile
authorities. .

Kennedy's Brain

LOS ANGELES, June 7 PD — The bullet
wourd in the brain of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
was so severe that even if he had lived there
would have been “‘exfensive damage,” Coroner
Thomas Noguchi said yesterday.

“Scattered fragments of the: bullet and bone
tissue damaged the main portion of the right side
of the brain,” said the Coroner. He refused to _
semment specifically on whether there might .
have been impairment af syesight, speech and
movement but said “the mjury was so severe as
4o causé extensive damage.”

Another bullet entered the back portion of the |
right arm pit and traveled upward. tt lodged just
beneath the filesh of Sen. Kennedy's neck. That
bullet was removed and turned over to the police.
It tore thru layers of muscle tissue but did not
penetrate any vital organs.

Dr. Noguchi said all the vital organs were re- i
moved from Sen. Kennedy's body, including the
entire brain, and retained here for further palhe-
logical examination.

The complete autopsy report will not be com-
pleigd for a few weeks, said Dr. Noguchi. “It
must be thoro, Let me emphasize that we have
the Yery best of facilities,” he said.

Dr} Noguchi, two pathologists on his staff ai
three medical consultants from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology in Washington, D. C., con
pleted the autopsy in 6 hours and 15 minutes.

Kennedy Lies in State; Funeral Tomorrow With Burial Here

Rich and Poor Say a Final

NEW YORK. June 7 (Pl — Thousands of mour-
ners filled St. Patrick’s Cathedral at sunrise to-
day infu last farewell to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
They Yept, crossed themselves and some kissed
his coffin in bereavement.

mmcely rich whose background he shared
and the struggling poor whose cause he cham-
Pioned came in sadness to the mighty Gothic
cathedral on Fifth Avenue to pass by the closed
eoffin. His adopted eity and the nation were say-
ing goodby to the assassinated Senator they knew ,
