_ZAKY ASLAN, 1928 I Street, N.W., employed as
adapter -ar cer, Voice of America, U. S. Information
Agency, “330 [Independence Ave., S.W., advised/SA ROGER

on day of assassination of ROBERT F. KENN
told ASLAN an employee at the Embassy sa
SIRHAN SIRHAN. Later in the day ASLAN called AKKAD
for more information about SIRHAN and was told by AKKAD
that the unnamed employee at Saudi-Arabian Embassy said
SIRHAN is from a village, Silwan, near Jerusalem and
had been in the US for five years. Also SIRHAN is from
a wealthy family. ASLAN said that the information was
incorrect according to information published in news-
papers, and it appears to him that the employee at the
Embassy was probably indicating he knew SHIRHAN when
in fact he did not. ASLAN obtained from his roommate

AKKAD the name of the employee, SHUKRI A./ZAZO0, typist

at the Seudi-Arabian Babassy.
