Sination, and she related the following information regarding
the incident which occurred the day before the. assassination.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on June 4, 1968, after
she and her roommate had gone to bed, they received a
telephone call. Miss BREDVOLD said she answered the phone
and the man calling asked her if she were Miss LEIB. When,
she told the man that she was Miss LEIB's roommate, the
caller indicated that either she or Miss LEIB would be
all right. He then gave his name, which Miss BREDVOLD
does not recall, but said it was a common name; he iden-
tified himself as being with the press or perhaps the
KENNEDY press, she does not recall which. The man then
asked if he could borrow a razor. When told that they
did not have one, the man said someone in the news room
told him that they would have one. The man then explained
to Miss BREDVOLD that the KENNEDY party was coming in
and he wanted to shave because he had been in trouble
before for not being clean-shaven. Miss BREDVOLD then
suggested to this man to call Room Service or a man.
She said the conversation ended on a friendly note.

Miss BREDVOLD said the next morning Miss LEIB
learned that this man had made a number of long distance
calls, which he charged to the KENNEDY party, and had
already left the hotel without paying his bill. Miss
BREDVOLD said she did not feel then, nor does she feel
now, that the above incident had any connection whatsoever
with the KENNEDY assassination, and she regarded it as
a practical joke or perhaps an attempt by this man to
meet her and her roommate.

Miss BREDVOID also related the details of another

incident which occurred after the assassination. She
said she didmt know the significance of the infor-
mation, but furnished it for whatever value it may be
to the authorities investigating Senator KENNEDY's
assassination.

She said that on Wednesday afternoon, June 5, 1968,
after Senator KENNEDY had been shot, but before he died, a
man, who gave his name as either GREEN or WHITE, and identified
himself as a "producer" came up to her and asked if she could
arrange for him to meet CHARLES EVERS of the National
Associatior For the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
The man explained that he had seen Miss BREDVOLD and her girl
f¥reand sitting with EVERS the day before and he thought they
must be "important people" who could arrange an interview with
EVERS. This man then told Miss BREDVOLD that he felt that he
had seen SIRHAN B. SIRHAN in the hotel the previous morning,
Tuesaday, June 4, 1968, talking to a group of Arabs who work
in the hotel restaurant. He asked members of this group if
they had talked with SIRHAN on Tuesday, and they said that they
had. This man said that this group of Arabs consisted of four
or five persons, who are very clannish. He said he tried
to give this information to the police, but they did not
“pay any attention" to him. He then explained that he
wanted to meet CHARLES EVERS and tell him the story because
he felt that EVERS would be able to get someone to listen
to it. .

Miss BREDVOID said that she told this man that
she would not arrange for him to meet EVERS, whom she -
hardly knew, because he had too much on his mind already.
She then suggested that this man give whatever information
he had to the police or to the FBI.

She stated that she did not see this man again
and she described him as follows:

stated that she was not present when Senator KENNEDY was killed
and could furnish no information in this regard.

advised that he was formerly the Postmaster General and
that he was registered at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles,
California, on May 29, 1968, and departed from the hotei and
the city of Los Angeles on May 30, 1968, at which time he
returned to his home in Springfield, Illinois.

for a press conference with Senator TYDINGS of Maryland and
Mrs. MARIETTA TREE, a former member of the Delegation to the
United Nations and a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party.

Mr. DAY stated that the hotel records may have still
had him listed as being registered there on June 4, 1968,
