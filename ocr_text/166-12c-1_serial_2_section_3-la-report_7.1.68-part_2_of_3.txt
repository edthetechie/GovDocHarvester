LLOYD EVERETT WALKER, race horse owner and
trainer at Golden Gate Fields (CGF) Race Track, Albany ,
California, observed a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN and
advised that he is not acquainted with this person and could
furnish no information about him.

However, he advised that at the beginning of the

"pacing meet" at GGF, which commenced on March 4, 1968,
there was an “exercise boy" who was at the track for
about the first two months of the meet, March and: April.
He has not seen the exercise boy in about two months. | This
exercise boy resembled SIRHAN and was the usual size of

a jockey, about 5'5", 115 pounds, black hair, brown eyes,
and dark complexion. ;

He advised this exercise boy was acquainted with
two of his employees who are Mexican and they conversed
with the unknown exercise boy in Spanish and for this |
reason he thought the exercise boy was from Mexico also.

Although this exercise boy resembles STRHAN,
WALKER does not feel that he is identical because the
exercise boy had a very short haircut, almost a "baldy."

WALKER advised that his employses who knew the
exercise boy are as follows: GILBERT APODACA, his jockey,
and APODACA's younger brother PHIL APODACA, who is an
exercise boy. They are both available at Barn 21, GGF Race
Track, Albany, California.

EDWARD VAN ANTWERP was located at the home of EARL COBB,
Route 1, Box 409, Eureka, and furnished the following infor-
mation: :

He has been on a severe alcoholic drunk during the past
weeks and has returned to a rational condition. He is aware
of the death of Senator KENNEDY and has read in the newspaper
of the arrest of SIRHAN SIRHAN. This is the first information
that he has ever had of SIRHAN SIRHAN. VAN ANTWERP has never
worked on a horse ranch in Norco, California, and has never
lived or worked with SIRHAN.

VAN ANTWERP claims his wife is a mental case and probably
told the FBI that he knew SIRHAN in order to get them to locate
him as he has run away from her. VAN ANTWERP was employed
during the general period of 1966-67 at Thermo Chemagee (phonetic)
Company, a fertilizer processing plant at Chino, California, and
after that time for Taylor Rentals Company, a rental agency at
Norco, California.

EDWARD VAI! ANTVERP, Route 1, Box 409, Eureka, Calif-
ornia, was reinterviewed, The information furnished by his
relatives at Norco, California regarding VAN ANTWERP livire
with SIRBAN STRHA™, whom they knew es "SOL" was discussed
with him.

After considerable conversation and viewing of
published photograph of SIRHAN, VAN ANTWERP became fully con-
vineed that "SOL" and SIRHAN are identical, that. this is
the young man with whom he lived for about 5 months in late
1966 at the Highlander Motel and another address in Norco,
California, VAN ANTWERP gave the appearance of total
amazement when this realization came upon him. He stated
"Why would 'SOL' do a thing like that,"

VAN ANTWERP met SIRHAN totally by chance at the
Highlander Motel, when SIRHAN came there looking for a place
to stay. VAN ANTWERP was drinking that day and they got
into a conversation which resulted in SIRHAN moving into
his motel room with him. Although they occupied the same
room for about 5 months, they did not associate much else-
where, SIRHAN worked at Corona Del Mar Horse Boarding
Stables as an exercise boy. VAN ANTWERP was working for
Taylor Rentals in Norco. SIRHAN said his home was in
Pasadena, and he went there frequently on weekends to visit
his family. During the week, SIRHAN went to work at the
horse stables each morning, returning in the evening in a
routine fashion. About all he did at the motel was sit
around quietly drinking tea in great quantities. The only
thing out of the ordinary that VAN ANTWERP noticed about
SIRHAN was that he did seem to have a feeling that he was
getting an unfair deal in life mainly because he was econ-
omically poor. SIRHAN did not set forth any radical political
views or make comments indicating any thing extraordinary
in his personality.

VAN ANTWERP has no knowledge of SIRHAN's associates,
social organization affiliations, political beliefs, ethnic
background, family, or any thing else of a personal nature.

VAN ANTWERP did not meet SIRHAN's family or friends.
He did not go to Pasadena with him on weekends. To his know-
ledge, SIRHAN did not own a firearm. He never heard SIRHAN
discuss Senator ROBERT KENNEDY or any other major political
figures that he can now recall.

VAN ANTWERP repeatedly stated that it was difficult
for him to believe that "SOL" could have committed such a
erime and that nothing occurred during his association with
SIRHAN which would have given any indication of such violence
being in his nature,

flowers to KENNEDY in San Francisco.

After the flowers had been given, the man asked
’DE LA VEGA to take him to the San Francisco International
Airport after he dropped off the other two. They drove back
to the Haight-Ashbury District and the male with his dog got
out. The female asked if he could drop her off at héme in
San Bruno inasmuch as they were going to the airport.

DE LA VEGA said he took her home and believed he
might possibly be able to locate the house again saying
that it was in a group of tract homes. He is not sure
and he did not record the address any place. He then drove
the man to the San Francisco International Airport and believes
he delivered him to the United Air Lines area. Cab fare
was about $18, and the man gave him $35 and told him to keep
the change. He described the unknown male fare as a white
male American, about 50 years old, 5 feet 8 inches, to 5 feet
9 inches tall, weighing 200 pounds, athletic build, heavy
eyebrows, gray hair, balding or thinning on top, somewhat
bushy and long like a hippie at the rear. He wore a full
mustache, gray-white in color and gave the impression of
being Irish-Danish in descent. He had a fair complexion
and a roundish face and wore a watch but no rings. He had
on a brown coffee-colored type suit and stated sometime
during the ride that he was a salesman for Encyclopedia
Britannica. There was no noticeable accent in his speech.

The attache case he carried was of cowhide color
and was a square-cornered case with a handle at the top
and dividers and carried various papers as well as the metal
discs.

After picking up the two individuals at his
fare's request, they drove back to the Hilton Hotel to
pick up the flowers. The man went into the hotel and after
waiting some time returned to the cab with two green boxes
of long stem yellow roses, He sat in the front seat with the
driver while the other two were in the back with the dog. The
man instructed that they drive to KGO television station where
Senators KENNEDY and MC CARTHY were to appear.

DE LA VEGA observed the man remove the flowers from
the boxes and from a- brown leather attache case he removed
several of the same type of bronze-colored discs, possibly
10 or 12 all wired together with what appeared to be florist
wire and wired this group of discs to the yellow roses. He
repeated this with the other roses and another group of
the discs. The metal discs had apparently been prepared ahead
of time and each was wired with wire wrapped around the center of
each disc, this being separate from the fine wire soldered to
each disc. The man stated that these devices were "bugging
devices" and indicated he was not sure but believed the fine
wire was going to a telephone some way and the dise fit
into the telephone.

The man gave each bunch of the roses to the girl and
boy and instructed them to go to each entrance and give them
to KENNEDY. This was done sothat if KENNEDY missed one
the other would be able to give him the flowers.

DE LA VEGA said he drove to the television station,

‘parked his cab on Polk Street and all three individuals left

the cab and disappeared into the crowd about the time

Senators KENNEDY and MC CARTHY arrived. They were gone about

10 to 15 minutes. All three returned to the cab and the girl

said she had personally given KENNEDY her bunch of the roses.
Disposition of the other bunch of the roses is unknown to DE LA VEGA.
The girl said to the man that the discs’ were apparent to persons

in the crowd and several of the people in the crowd seeing the

bouquet said "Hey, it's bugged.'

DE LA VEGA said the man seemed pleased that KENNEDY
had gotten the roses and he observed him pay each of the
other two passengers five dollars plus some one dollar bills.

Some time during the cab ride the man had

mentioned that MC CARTHY had gotten a similar bouquet in Los
Angeles and he had come up here especially to present the Yoses.

On June 9, 1968, JERRY DE LA VEGA, 1863 - 9th Avenue,
San Francisco, telephone 566-3814, appeared at the office of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, San Francisco,
with ROBERT RICHARDSON, 1144 Cervantes Street, Pacifica,
California. DE LA VEGA is a Yellow Cab driver and made
available a bronze-colored dise with a short wire attached
which gave the impression of being some sort of fusing device
for military ordnance, exact nature of which is unknown. This
device had been discovered by DE LA VEGA on the floor of his
cab immediately after he had left his fare at the San Francisco
International Airport.

DE LA VEGA related the following circumstances:

He was driving his cab on Saturday, June 1, 1968, the
day of the ROBERT F. KENNEDY and EUGENE MC CARTHY Debate on
television. He was parked in front of the Hilton Hotel,

San Francisco, at approximately 4:30 p.m., when a man giving
him the impression of a businessman entered his cab. The
man asked DE LA VEGA where he could locate a couple of girls
who would like to help him out by "putting KENNEDY on”. DE
LA VEGA understood this to mean that the man was going to
Play a joke on KENNEDY. The man said he wanted the girls

to present some flowers to KENNEDY.

DE LA VEGA drove the man to the vicinity of the
University of San Francisco looking for a couple of girls and
found none. DE LA VEGA suggested they might find someone
in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco. DE LA VEGA
said the man seemed to be a complete stranger to San
Francisco. He drove the fare to Stanyan and Haight Streets
and picked up a white female juvenile, about 17 to 20 years old,
medium build, long dark hair, wearing casual sports clothes.

The girl agreed to present the flowers to KENNEDY. They

drove about a block more and located a white male juvenile,

about the same age, with a large German Shepherd dog. The

male is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall, 125 to 130 pounds,
wearing dark brown clothes. The male agreed to accompany them
in presentation of the flowers. Both the girl and male were com-

JANOS RADVANYI, Charge D' Affairs of Hungarian
Embassy in Washington, D.C. from 1962-1967, volunteered
the following information as background in the Middle East
on June 7, 1968:

RADVANYI was in the Middle East in Syria and
Lebanon in 1957 and 1958 and has no current information
concerning the situation there at the present time. However,
in 1957 and 1958 the Syrian Communist Party was the center
of Communist Party activities in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan,
although each nation had its separate national organizations.
The Communist Parties in Syria and Lebanon at that time were
half illegal and completely illegal in Jordan. The head of
the Communist Party in Syria at that time, and possibly
today if the situation has not changed was one BAGDASH.
RADVANYI stated the Communist Party in the Middle East when
he was there was very fanatic and nationalistic and it did
considerable work among the Palestinian refugees, making them
very corruptible. He stated that the refugees suffered
greatly and they were very easy to buy off with money and
ideology.

RADVANYI furnished this information for background
in view of the nationality of the accused slayer of Senator
ROBERT KENNEDY.

The Oklahoma City Office, on dune 7, 1968, advised
that authorities at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary (OSP),
Me Alester, Oklahoma, on that date made available the following
letter addressed to FBI, Tulsa, Oklahoma:

"Dear Sir. I have just heard of the attempt on
Mr. ROBERT KENNEDY's live. I have myself at one
time been suspicioned of such dire happening.

You can find my name in secret service files. I
would like strongly to suggest in the course

of your investigation you question one MAX STROSS,
JR., 3545 Oakridge Drive, Woodland Hills,
California, and MICKY BELFORT. I am unaware of his
address, although it is in the Santa Ana hills
section of Orange County. I have definite reasons
of belief of knowledge by the poeple of the events
of the past 24 hours.

‘Most sincerely,
S/DAVID EUGENE KATES
OSP Number 75728"

On June 7, 1968, DAVID EUGENE KATES was interviewed
by Bureau Agents at OSP, Mc Alester, Oklahoma. KATES stated
he became associated with STROSS and BELFORT while a student
at Orange High School, Orange, California, in 1962. STROSS
and BELFORT persuaded KATES to hand out Nazi propaganda.

KATES states that STROSS and BELFORT associated with individual
at Orange, California, who appears to be identical with
photograph in newspapers of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. This
individual was not a student at Orange High School, but
attended school functions there and had a girl friend, GLORIA
GONZALES, a student at Santa Ana, California, High School.
KATES has not seen STROSS or BELFORT since 1963 when he moved
from California. He did not recall the name of the individual
who appeared to be identical with SIRHAN.

KATES thinks that STROSS and BELFORT were arrested
during riots in Los Angeles in 1962. He described STROSS as
a white male American, early twenties, five feet seven inches
in height, 190 pounds, heavy build, sandy brown hair, medium

complexion and an only child.

He described BELFORT as a white male American,
Five feet ten inches in height, 170 pounds, early twenties
black hair, dark eyes, dark complexion, medium build, two
older brothers.

KATES was received at OSP July 17, 1967, from Oklahoma
County for robbery with firearms and unauthorized use of motor
vehicle, sentenced to nine years. He is described as a white
male American, five feet eleven and one-half inches in height,

slender build, ruddy complexion, black hair, brown eyes,
porn at San Diego, California, FBI Number Pll
789 O82 E.

During interview KATES admitted that while he was an
inmate at FCI, Englewood, Colorado, in 1964, he wrote two
letters threatening to kill President JOHNSON. He was then
transferred on December 17, 1964, to the Medical Center for
Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri. He was discharged
October 11, 1966. On October 12, 1966, KATES was arrested by
Secret Service, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and charged with oral threat
against the President. On October 20, 1966, he was admitted as
a patient, Eastern State Hospital, Vinita, Oklahoma. He claims
to have been released November 13, 1966. On November 16, 1966,
he was arrested by Sheriff's Office, Oklahoma City, for
unauthorized use of motor vehicle and claims to have been
incarcerated since that time. KATES had no information to tie
STROSS and BELFORT to Senator KENNEDY's death.

KATES is a former inmate of Federal Correctional
Institution (FCI), Englewood, Colorado. He reportedly attempted
to poison a fellow inmate at FCI, Englewood, Colorado. KATES
reportedly had recruited his victim into the American Nazi
Party (ANP) and the incident was over victim's defection. Prison
records showed an interview with KATES wherein he claimed to have
been in contact with GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL, former ANP National
Commander while KATES was in California. Colorado prison
records further showed KATES "had a definite paranoid and schizoid
tendency and could easily become fanatic.

tion identifiable with STROSS, BELFORT, or GLORIA GONZALES,
described by KATES as:a girl friend of an individual, name
unrecalled, who resembled SITRHAN.

Los Angeles files contain only one reference
identifiable with KATES, A review of this file indicated
that KATES and one CHUCK L. COLEMAN, inmates at FCI, Engle-
wood, Colorado, contacted the United States Attorney General
at Washington, D.C., in which letter they desired to be
deported from the United States and claimed to be associated
with the ANP in California.

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Office (LASO) | eriminal records contain no
record identifiable with STROSS and BELFORT.

Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Office unable to run a search on GLORIA GONZALES
without further descriptive data. LAPD contains a criminal
record for KATES under LAPD Number 697-634-K, which reflects
that on April 6, 1964, KATES was arrested by LAPD for driving
a vehicle without the owner's permission. Records reflect
that disposition on this case indicated thet KATES, who
reportedly was in the military at the time, was turned over
to military authorities at Los Angeles.

A confidential source at Los Angeles, California,
who is cognizant of all ANP membership and activities in the
Los Angeles area as well as riotous situations in the
Los Angeles area, on June 11, 1968, advised their files
contain no records identifiable with KATES, BELFORT, STROSS,

during 1962. The "Watts Riot" which KATES may have
referred to during interview on June 7, 1968, occurred
August 1965.

The address of 3545 Oakridge Drive, Woodland Hills,
California, furnished by KATES as the home address of MAX
STROSS, JR., is non-existent.

Mrs. ETHEL ROONEY, Supervisor, United States Post
Office, Woodland Hillis, California, on June 11, 1968,
advised that 3545 Oakridge Drive is not an address within
that postal district. One Oakridge Drive was found to be
within the Glendale area of the metropolitan Los Angeles
County. This is a two block area which numerical units
consist from the 1100 block through the 1200 block. Review

On dune 10, 1968, the records of the Credit Bureau
of Orange County, records of the Orange Police Department,
Orange, California, and the records of the Orange County
Sheriff's Office were reviewed, and no record identifiable
with MAX STROSS, JR., MICKY BELFORT, or GLORIA GONZALES
could be located.

Records of the Orange Police Department revealed
that KATES was arrested by that agency on April 6, 1964,
for Grand Theft Auto, KATES was AWOL at that time from
Fort Polk, Louisianna.

On June 10, 1968, Mr. GEORGES BELFORT, 2020 Fullerton,
Costa Mesa, California, was interviewed and advised that the
name of MICKY BELFORT was unfamiliar to him, He stated he
knows of no one of a similar name in the Orange County area.

Records of the Orange Unified High School District
(OUSD), Orange, as reviewed on June 12, 1968, revealed that
KATES attended OUSD in the third grade, again in the fifth
grade, through his junior year in high school, ending
June 19, 1962. These records indicated KATES had not
returned for his senior year as he had moved to Grove,
Oklahonia.

OQUSD records further revealed that MAX JOSEPH STROSS,
born in Berwyn, Illinois, had entered OUSD
in the fourth grade during April 1957, and had attended through
the sixth grade. STROSS had entered OUSD from Bakersfield,
Calicornia, and no further attendance record or background

good reputation as a dentist and has a successful practice.

TOMA advised that he is an active member of the
John Birch Society and has been a member of the Society
since 1960, He feels it is a good organization and that
it will save the United States from being destroyed at the
hands of misguided individuals.

TOMA stated that he has strong convictions regarding
the United States and feels that the liberal leaders in this
country together with pro-communist sympathizers are doing
the evil work of the communists and are destroying what this
country stands for. He stated that he feels no hatred towards
any particular individual but does blame the liberal leaders
in this country for not stopping the looting and lawlessness
as evidenced by recent riots. He stated that these leaders
are financing the poverty program and other programs which
are leading to anarchy.

TOMA advised that he is friendly with the editor
of "Pyramid Magazine" and that, while he is not involved
in the publishing of this magazine, he is completely in
line with its viewpoint. He added that this magazine is
published monthly.

TOMA advised that he has never met nor had any
contact whatsoever with SIRHAN SIRHAN but learned recently
that allegedly, more than five years ago, SIRHAN SIRHAN
attended the same church which TOMA attended. TOMA identified
this church as the Syrian Orthodox Church located at Third
and Alvarado Streets, Los Angeles, and its Pastor as Father
PAUL ROMLEY. He added that to his knowledge, SIRHAN SIRHAN
did not attend this church in recent years,

TOMA advised that he has had no contact whatsoever
with the late Senator ROBERT KENNEDY and that he knows of
no one who felt so strongly towards the Senator and his
beliefs that they would resort to violent means. He further
stated that he knows of no one who has had any contact
whatsoever with SIRHAN SIRHAN and explained that his publi-
cations and the people he is involved with advocate only
legal methods to exposé individuals and make changes. He
stated that he purports only education as a means of making
the necessary changes and believes that murder only assists
the communists in their obvious attempt to create confusion
and disorder. He reiterated that he believes strongly in
law and order and reiterated that he knows of no one who
would, in anyway, get involved in an assassination plot.

5 The signature on the available photocopy of the

St. Horse Racing Bd.. Los Angeles, Califernia) is tao limited
and not sufficiently comparable with the questioned writing on
the specimens described abave for the purpose of determining
whether SIRHAN wrote any of the questioned writing.

separately to PSI, Los Angeles. This material has been.
photographed.

A translation of the foreign language material
contained in the submitted specimens is attached.

Note for Los Angeles:

This supplements Bureau teletype dated 6/6/68 to
Los Angeles in this case.

A separate report is being submitted concerning the
fingerprint examination, at which time you will be edvised
with respect to the return of the submitted evidence.

Nothing significant was noted in the cryptanalytic
examination of specimens Q1 through 014.

The questioned writing was searched through the
ate sections of the National Security File without
g an identification with any prior submission,

It was found that the typewriting on Q7 and Q11
is not clear enough for adequate examination.

Certain indented writings were found on
‘pages of the notebook, Q3, It was found that these
indented writings correspond to writings on cher pages
in the submitted material.

Various ink and pencil writings appear on
the questioned documents. Faint writings consisting of
ink transfers were noted on pages 65 and 122 of notebook,
Q3. Ink transfers of this nature sometimes occur when
‘documents are pressed closely together for some pericd
of time. The faint writing on page 122 of Q3 is a
transference of a portion of page 123 of Q3. The original
document from which the ink transference on page 65 of Q3

originated does nat appear to be contained in any of the
submitted material.

The seven sheets of spiral notebook paper listed
as Q5 correspond in physical features to the pages in the
notebook, Q3. The sheets in Q5 were probably torn from Q3.

Stains appear on certain of the questioned
documents. Since exhaustive Laboratory examination of
the stains would entail destruction of portions of the

documents, chemical examinations of the stains were not
made.
