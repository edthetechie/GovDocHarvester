During the investigation concerning the assassination
of the late Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, a .22 caliber shell
casing bearing an indentation made by the firing pin of the
Iver-Johnson .22 caliber revolver was made available by Captain
DON MARTIN, Scientific Investigations Division (SID), Los
Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

Information was developed that SIRHAN SIRHAN practiced
shooting at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte, California,
on June 4, 1968.. In that connection, arrangements were made
with LLOYD HAGER, Range Manager, to obtain shell casings which
are commonly referred to as "brass" from several of the firing
positions at that gun club.

The shell casing made available by Captain DON MARTIN
of the LAPD and the shell casings obtained from the San Gabriel
Valley Gun Club were forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for
comparison purposes in an effort to determine whether or not
the indentations made by the firing pin on the shell casings
obtained from the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club are identical
to the shell casing furnished by Captain MARTIN,

The FBI Laboratory advised on July 5, 1968, that in
view of previous firearms examinations conducted by the LAPD
and the apparent limited value of the resulting information
to this case, the cartridge cases were not examined by the
Laboratory and were returned to Los Angeles via Air Express
on July 5, 1968.

The cartridge cases were turned over to the LAPD
by SA GEORGE M. KLING on July 16, 1968.
