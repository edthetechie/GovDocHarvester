Washington, L.C

LANSING LAMONT, National Political Correspondent,
Time Magazine interviewed instant.

LAMONT was in the Embassy Room, Ambassador Hotel
during victory speech of the late ROBERT F. KENNEDY on June 4-
5, 1968. Entered serving kitchen area, scene of shooting 2-3
minutes after and could furnish no pertinent information re
SIRHAN SIRHAN. FD 302's to follow.

Mr, LAMONT did advise that he had been in Los Angeles
3-5 weeks ago at a press conference held in the Ambassador
Hotel by Senator FRED HARRIS. At that time one of Senator
HARRIS' aides asked him if he had seen the photo taken of
Senator KENNEDY at San Francisco, California in December of
1967 when KENNEDY was in San Francisco holding a hearing concerning
the plight of American Indians. Senator KENNEDY is alleged to
have posed with one of the Indian delegates, possibly a woman
for the purposes of having a picture taken by another Indian
woman,

The pictures apparently were developed subsequent to
the assassination and a person strongly resembling SIRHAN
SIRHAN appears from behind and between Senator KENNEDY and the
unidentified Indian who is posing with him.

Mr. LAMONT stated a woman identified as UOROTHY
COULTER (ph) is alleged to have seen the photograph and knew
the identity of the Indian woman who took the picture and
owns the photograph was believed to reside in the outlying
Los Angeles area.

LAMONT stated he visited an unrecalled woman employed
at Disneyland Studios and viewed copies of the picture which
he described as a snapshot size photocolor picture. He stated
the face appearing between the Indian and the late Senator
ROBERT ¥. KENNEDY does have a striking resemblance to SIRHAN
SIRHAN; however, he believes possibly the chin appeared to be
too round and "thrust out" compared to later photographs observed
of SIRHAN SIRHAN. He said the face in the photos was partially
obscured by shadows.

Mr. LAMONT stated he submitted the pertinent information
pertaining to this possibly "new photo" to the Los Angeles
Bureau Ghief of Time, Mr. MARSHALL BERGESS, LAMONT believes
possibly the original or copies of this snapshot has been
submitted to the FBI, Los Angeles, and to the Los Angeles
volice Department.

In the event Los Angeles does not have information
regarding this snapshot taken in December of 1967 at Senator
KENNEDY's Indian hearings.

Los Angeles should immediately contact Time, Inc.,
MARSHALL BERGESS, re the identities andwhereabouts of DUROTHY
CUULTER (possibly affiliated with Vice-rresident HUBERT H. HUMPHREY
Headquarters in LA) and the identity and whereabouts of the
woman alleged to have taken the photograph.

Re: KENSALT Lab. No. D-680918067 AT

Specimens received 9/17/68

Qc33 Photocopy of two-page handwritten letter dated 6/11/68,
_ bearing message in Serbo-Croation language (copy of
* original letter previously submitted)

Kce23 Photocopy of two-page letter dated at Paris, 5/24/66,
bearing purported handwriting of DJURO STOKIC

Ke24 Photocopy of two-page letter in Serbo-Croation language,
dated 1/22/68, purportedly written by DJURO STOKIC, and
attached copy of photograph, alleged to be that of the
writer.

Result of examination:

. It was found that the purported writing of DJURO STOKIC
appearing on the submitted photocopies designated .Kc23 and Kc24
is entirely too indistinct to permit a suitable comparison with
the questioned writing on the two-page letter designated as Q33.
Specimen Q33 is the original letter for the photocopy, Qc33. Q533
and the envelope in which it was mailed, designate: ;are
described in FBI Laboratory report dated 8/23/68, a
was furnished to the Director, U.S. Secret Service, Washington, D.C.
Photocopies of Q32 and Q33 were furnished with FBI Laboratory
report of 8/23/68. ;

Due to the indistinctness of the writing on Kc23 and
Kc24, a definite conclusion was not reached whether DJURO STOKIC
wrote the questioned writing on Q32 and Q33, Certain handwriting
characteristics were noted in the purported known writing of
DJURO STOKIC on Ke23 and Kc24 which are consistent with handwriting
characteristics in the letter designated as Q33. These consistences
in handwriting characteristics indicate that Q33 may have been
written by DJURO STOKIC.

The submitted material is beingretained in the FBI files.

Mr. J. SONOSKY, 815 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., fur-
nished the following information:

SONOSKY advised that he formerly worked with ROBERT
F, KENNEDY when Mr, KENNEDY was investigating the rackets and
he became a close personal friend of KENNEDY's, SONOSKY stated,
however, that he was in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, on per-
sonal business and was not there as a part of the KENNEDY
campaign in California, :

SONOSKY stated that he was registered at the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles and on the night of June 4, 1968, he re-
calls that he "wandered" around the Embassy Room at the Ambassador
until approximately 7 P.M., when he went out to dinner. He
said that he returned to his room at approximately 10:30 P.M,
and watched the election returns on television for a time. He
said that he did not go to the ballroom, where KENNEDY met his
supporters, but went, instead, to a second ballroom below the
ballroom where KENNEDY gave his victory speech.

SONOSKY stated that he was in this second ballroom
when he received word that Senator KENNEDY had been shot.
SONOSK¥ stated that he had been trained as an investigator
when working for the Senate Rackets Committee and he attempted
to assess the situtaion with a trained eye, He said he watched
closely the reaction of people around him but, other than the
hysterical behavior one would expect in such a situation, he
saw nothing unusual. SONOSKY stated that he saw no behavior
which would indicate that any other persons were involved,
nor did he ever observe the assassin during the time that he
moved about the hotel,
