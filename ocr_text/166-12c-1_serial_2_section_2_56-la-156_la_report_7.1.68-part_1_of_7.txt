RONALD T, BENNETT, 2508 Highland Avenue, Manhattan
Beach, California, telephone 515-2611, who is employed as a
staff photographer for United Press International (UPT),
1543 West Olympic Boulevard, Suite 438, Los Angeles,
California, telephone 387-7221, furnished the following
information with respect to his observations and knowledge
or oon assassination of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY on June 5,
1968:

He was given the assignment on June 4, 1968 to
take photographs of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY at the Ambassador
Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, and
at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening he went to the
Ambassador Hotel. He parked his car in the rear parking lot
of the hotel and entered the hotel by the north main entrance.
He then proceeded to look at the ballroom and other areas in
the hotel to determine the possible position of the Senator
and camera angles he could photograph him from to his,
BENNETT's, best advantage. He had a drink at the bar and
then proceeded to the Fifth Floor, where the KENNEDY suite
was located and met an associate UPI photographer named
DAVE KENNERLY, who was also covering the KENNEDY rally. He
advised that on the left side was Senator KENNEDY's private
room while to the right was a larger room containing a bar
and many people. He and KENNERLY then milled around and he,
BENNETT, shot some photographs of KENNEDY in the larger room
where the bar was located. He recalls also that GLENN FORD
was in this room and he thinks he obtained several shots of
FORD talking with Senator KENNEDY.

Senator KENNEDY then left the larger room and retired
to his bedroom, so he, BENNETT, followed him to see where
he could get a better photograph of KENNEDY alone. He observed
Senator KENNEDY standing by a dresser mirror reading a
newspaper, and catching glimpses of the television coverage of
the primary election results. He then asked the Senator if
he could shoot a picture in the mirror of him and the Senator
replied, "No not in my bedroom for Pete's sake", At that time

one of the Senator's public relations men, named DICK TUCK,
entered the room and berated BENNETT for attempting to
photograph the Senator in his bedroom. TUCK then went into
the hallway and made a joke of it to several of the other
members of the press and photographers who were there.

He, BENNETT, waited in the hallway for approximately
ten minutes for KENNEDY to leave his bedroom and go downstairs
to the ballroom where the rally was taking place. KENNEDY
did leave the bedroom and he proceeded toward the elevator.
Since there was too large a crowd at that location for him to
take any photographs, he and DAVE KENNERLY, who was with him
at that time, ran down the stairs to try to get a photograph
of Senator KENNEDY as he was disembarking from the elevator,
He did not observe that the Senator disembarked from the
elevator, but he noticed everyone who was downstairs, and
also waiting for the Senator, leave the area and start
toward the ballroom, He then recalls that someone said,

"Here he comes.", referring to Senator KENNEDY and he
observed the Senator approach the area of the ballroom,

BENNETT advised he was able to mount the platform
directly behind ETHEL KENNEDY, while the rally was taking
place. He took five or six photographs from that position
with his wide angle 35mm Nikon, using Tri-X black and white
negative film. He stated that one of these photographs
was subsequently published as a UPI news photo.

Senator KENNEDY then made his speech and during
this speech the pressures of the crowd kept shoving him into
ETHEL KENNEDY and his camera jammed her in the back, She
complained to several of the KENNEDY aides who were present and
the next thing he knew, ROOSEVELT GRIER. grabbed him from
behind, placing one hand around his stomach, so as to prevent
him from being pushed into Mrs, KENNEDY.

When Senator KENNEDY finished his speech, he proceeded
to shake hands with several people in the crowd and signed some

- 348 -

LA 56-156

autographs. He, BENNETT, thought that the Senator would leave
the ballroom by going to his right, however, he left the area
through some curtains, which were behind the podium. This
led into the kitchen area and he, BENNETT, proceeded to follow
as fast as he could. There were one or two individuals
between himself and Senator KENNEDY as the group was making
its way through the kitchen. Just as he, BENNETT, passed the
metal doorway leading to the kitchen area, he heard what he
later learned were five shots, At that time, he had the
impression that firecrackers were going off. He does not
recall the pattern of the shots that were fired, but they
were very rapid. He does not recall seeing Senator KENNEDY
fall to the ground, but as soon as he heard the shots being
fired he, BENNETT, immediately dove to the floor. Directly
to his right was a businessman, PAUL SCHRADE, who was struck
in the head by one of the bullets, At that time he recalls
seeing some greyish smoke in the air, but this was only. an
impression and he does not know specifically where the smoke
came from, He then ducked behind a small doorway on the
right side of the kitchen doorway, where he saw several
people lying on the floor. He automatically ;
started to shoot photographs of everything he saw.

He recalls he shot several photographs of Senator
KENNEDY while the Senator was lying on the floor, and then he
recalls he shot four or five photographs of SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, During this time, he also observed someone limping
through the crowd and heard this individual say something,
but he does not recall specifically what it was. He does not
recall seeing Mrs, KENNEDY, however, upon observing some of
the photographs that he shot she was in these photographs.
He does recall her telling the crowd to move back and to
give "him",referring to Senator KENNEDY, some air.

He then jumped up on the kitchen counter and took
some photographs of the suspect from that angle. At that
time SIRHAN still had a gun in one of his hands and several
people seemed to be on top of him, either punching him or
hitting him. PIERRE SALINGER theh jumped up onto the counter

- 349 -


--- Page 6 ---
un
LA 56-156

and pushed him off of it. He recalls that SALINGER was crying

at the time and was very upset with him for shooting photographs

of Senator KENNEDY and SIRHAN. SALINGER also became angry

with a woman photographer, whom he knows only as VIRGINIA. He-
‘recalls VIRGINIA:had one of the KENNEDY. aidés, name unrecalled, tell
hii, BENNETT, not to shoot any more pictures.

Ag SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN was being removed from the
kitchen area, he, BENNETT, shot some more photographs of him.
At that time, one of the KENNEDY aides attempted to get the
ambulance driver to throw him, BENNETT, out, evidently thinking
that the ambulance driver was a policeman. He recalls seeing
another photographer by the name of RICHARD DREW from the
"Pasadena Star News" newspaper standing near him and they
exchanged a few pleasantries the nature of which he does not
recall,

At that time Senator. KENNEDY was still on the floor and
several: people were about him. Several. policemen were also on the
scene and they started to block off the area, thereby
isolating the Senator from the crowd. He, BENNETT, was
able to barge through several policemen and retrieve his
Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Sheriff's
Office press pass, which had been knocked to the floor
approximately two to three feet from Senator KENNEDY's out-
stretched legs, when he, BENNETT, was pushed from the counter
by PIERRE SACINGER,

The ambulance drivers then began to remove Senator
KENNEDY from the kitchen area, however, he did not wait to
see the Senator placed in the ambulance, but instead ran to
a telephone and called his office, telling his supervisor,
GLEN WAGNER, what had occurred.

He then ran out to the rear parking lot of the
Ambassador Hotel to look for his car, but he could not find
it for five or ten minutes. When he got his car started, the
police had the area barricaded, so he parked his car, leaving

~ 350 -

TA 56-156

some of his camera equipment in it, and then ran toward
Eighth’ Street, which is the street directly to the south
of the Ambassador Hotel, and after showing his press pass
to a policeman was able to get through the barricaded area,
He then stopped about three automobiles and asked the
drivers for a ride, but no one would give him one, until
three girls in a sportscar came along and consented to give
him a ride to his office. A police car then pulled along-
- gide them and he was able to ask them to give him a ride
to his office. He climbed into the police car and they
were about to proceed to his office, which is some distance
from the Ambassador Hotel, when the policemen told him they
could not leave the area. He then disembarked from the
police car and found a pay telephone and was able to call
his supervisor, GLEN WAGNER, and ask him to send someone
to pick him up. At that time a taxicab came by, so he hung
up the telephone and hailed the taxicab, and immediately
proceeded to his office.

He recalls that he took a total of two and a half
rolls of 35mm film, thirty six exposures of film to a roll,
however, one of the rolls did not turn out due to an error
in threading it while at the Ambassador Hotel. All the
photographs were developed by HOWARD DECKER, who was then
at the UPI office. BENNETT stated that all the photographs
that appeared in the newspapers were UPI photographs taken
by him and the negatives of these photographs were
immediately forwarded to Mr. CLIFF MC DOWELL, Vice
President, UPI Newspapers, 220 East 4end Street, New York
city.

BENNETT advised that the above information is
true and correct to the best of his knowledge. He further
advised that he does not recall seeing a young female
caucasian in a polkadot dress at any time on June 4 or 5,
1968 at the Ambassador Hotel, principally in the kitchen
area, just before or after Senator KENNEDY was shot.

HANS PETER BIDSTRUP advised that he is an Electrician
in the Maintenance Department of the Ambassador Hotel in
Los Angeles, California, and resides at_1886 North Avenue,

Los Angeles. He stated he was born on at Pll
Skorup, Denmark, and his wife is IRNA BIDSTRUP, who resides
with him,

Mr. BIDSTRUP advised that he arrived on duty at
the hotel at approximately 8:00 AM on Tuesday, June 4, 1968,
and left the hotel at approximately midnight the same date.
He stated that he left the hotel before the shooting of
Senator KENNEDY and had no first hand knowledge of the
happenings involved in this incident.

Mr. BIDSTRUP was shown a photograph of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN and asked if he had seen this individual
prior to the shooting of Senator KENNEDY. Concerning his
knowledge in this respect, he furnished the following signed
statement:

"Los Angeles, Calif.
June 10, 1968

"I, Hans Peter Bidstrup, make the following
voluntary free statement to John H. Borgman, who has
identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the
FBI,

"My name is Hans Peter Bidstrup. I was born
on at Skorup, Denmark. I reside at
1886 North Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. I am employed
as an electrician in the Maintainence Dept. of the
Ambassador Hotel.

"On the night of June 4, 196€ I was the standby
electrician in the sound booth at the Rafferty
Party in the Venetian Room at the Ambassador Hotel.
At about one hour before I went off duty, which
would be about 11 p.m. a man wandered into the booth.

"We sat down on a spool of wire. He had a drink

in his hand. I am not a drinking man, so I don't
know what kind of a drink he had but it was clear
with a milky white cast and had in it what appeared
to ve a piece of lime and a small red object which
looked like a piece of red candy to me. It was
round on one side and flat on the bottom.

"As Lest I can recall this man began the
conversation by saying 'I'm a Democrat!. He
asked me if I was a Democrat and I replied that
Iwas. He then asked me what I was doing, or
what my job was. I told him I was an electrician
and possibly I went into a little detail as to what
my duties were.

"Also, after I had told this man I was a
Democrat he held out his hand and shook hands
with me. He then inquired something to the effect
as to whether Senator Kennedy was going to be at
the hotel that night. I told him I thought he was.
The man appeared to be drinking, he did not appear
intoxicated, but drinking just enough to be talkative.
For this reason I did not pay too much attention
to the sequence of.the conversation & cannot remember
the exact words, for the most part, used by this
individual.

"This man asked in what room or on what floor
Kennedy was staying, when Kennedy was coming in
or if Kennedy was then in the hotel. I don't
remember that I knew at the time so I couldn't
tell him. The man made some inquiry concerning
Kennedy's security. I think it had to do with
whether or not Kennedy had bodyguards. Although
I'm not sure it was as direct as this but this is
the impression I have recalling it now.

"While weiwere talking,..a Los Angeles

fireman in uniform came into the booth. ‘he man
stopped his conversation and seemed to take

- 353 -


--- Page 10 ---

LA 56-156

"particular attention of the fireman. He asked
the fireman what he was doing or what his capacity
was. The fireman explained to the man that he

was a fireman and was there for crowd control

and fire security. The man appeared to take

less interest in the fireman after this.

"The fireman left shortly thereafter. The
man also asked when Kennedy was going to come to
the hotel. I did't know.

"The fireman left and returned a short time
later, staying a few minutes & left again. It
was about this time that the man left. About the same
time as the fireman left. However, I don't recall
if the two left together, or if the man left before
or after the fireman.

"The sound booth was in an isolated section
of the Venetian Room. The man came alone and did
not meet anyone outside the booth and to the best
of my knowledge was alone.

"The man who talked to me in the sound booth
looks very much like the photo of Sirhan Sirhan
shown to me by SA Borgman.

"T had, prior to the time that I talked to
SA Borgman, seen pictures of Sirhan in the newspaper
but the description of Sirhan in the newspaper
stated Sirhan had an accent & the man I talked to
had no accent. S89, altho I was struck by the
similarity between the newspaper photos of Sirhan
and the man I talked to, because of the accent
ascribed to Sirhan by the newspaper, I did not mention
the incident to the authorities.

"The man I talked to in the sound booth in
the Venetian Room I would describe as follows:

THERESA L. CHRISTIANSON, 121 South Hoover Street,
Los Angeles, was interviewed at this location and furnished
the following information:

She is sixteen years of age, having been born
Pil | at Santa Monica, California. At approximately

33:20 p.m. on the evening of June 4, 1963, she arrived at
the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, accompanied by her girl
friend, MYONN HYMER, 1175 South Windsor Boulevard, Los
Angeles, for the purpose of attending a celebration for
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY, candidate in the California
Presidential primary.

As CHRISTIANSON was standing near a metal bar
(serving alcoholic beverages) toward the rear of the
southwest portion of the ballroom, she became aware of a
male individual standing immediately behind her, less than
one foot away. Although she did not look this individual
directly in the face, she observed his face by looking in
a mirror approximately four feet in front of her behind the
bar. CHRISTIANSON noted that she and this individual were
the only oneSin the immediate area, and she thought it odd
that he would stand so close to her. CHRISTIANSON believes
that this man stood behind her for between four to five
minutes. During the entire four or five minutes, she
observed this man in the mirror. She felt a hard object
brush against her right hip, approximately waist high, and
feels that this object was either a belt buckle or something
in the man's pocket. At this point, CHRISTIANSON stated,
"Would you please move?," and the man replied only, "Yes,"
in a nervous voice and walked toward the east side of the
ballroom, disappearing from CHRISTIANSON's sight.

CHRISTIANSON advised that she has mentioned the
above individual to HYMER and that HYMER told her that she
did not see the man. CHRISTIANSON further noted that the
bartender at the nearby bar had gone to get some Coke for

the Coca Cola machine, otherwise she would have requested
the bartender to ask the above male individual to move
away from her.

CHRISTIANSON recalled that this male individual
was approximately the same height as herself, namely 5!'5",
and that his overall appearance was urkempt and out of place
at the hotel. She could not recall the man's dress, other
than that his clothing was light colored; that he was not
wearing a sport or suit type coat, and that his shirt was
open at the collar.

CHRISTIANSON indicated that she had seen photographs
of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN displayed by the news media and
she believes the individual she observed at the hotel very
closely resembles these photographs of SIRHAN.

CHRISTIANSON further described the above individual
as follows:

Race White

Sex ‘ Male

Complexion Dark

Age Middle to late 20s

Height 5t5*

Weight 140 pounds

Build Slender

Hair Black, medium length

On June 11, 1953, CHRISTIANSON was shown glossy
photographs of SIRHAN, including a Los Angeles Police
Department mug photograph taken June 5, 1963, and a left
profile view of SIRHAN taken sometime after the shooting of
KENNEDY on June 5, 1963. After viewing these photographs,
CHRISTIANSON again advised that the individual she observed
at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1963, very closely
resembles the photographs of SIRHAN.

following information:

He is currently employed as a Staff Photographer
for the Independent Star News, 525 East Colorado Boulevard,
Pasadena, California. He was assigned as a photographer to
coeet the KENNEDY function at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4,
1968.

He took no photographs of the actual shooting of
Senator KENNEDY or of suspect SIRHAN SIRHAN. His photographs
taken at the scene were made immediately after the shooting
occurred. He recalled seeing suspect SIRHAN SIRHAN struggling
with several people immediately after the shooting, but he can
not, of his own recollection, identify SIRHAN as the individual
who did the shooting or as the individual struggkihs with members
of the crowd around KENNEDY after the shooting.

He recalled seeing the individual later identified as
suspect SIRHAN, struggling with several people, two of whoir were
ROOSEVELT GRIER and RAFER JOHNSON: He did‘ A6t take ern
photographs of the struggle inasmuch as the light was not
sufficient for his photography and he was concentrating on
photographs of Senator KENNEDY.

Mr. DREW made availabe three copies of photographs
taken of Senator KENNEDY immediately after the shooting. Mr.
DREW stated that the negatives of these particuhar shots are
being retained by the paper on the advice of counsel, and copies
of additional shots made at the same time will be made available
in the near future.

Mr. DREW was unable to recall the exact time that the
above photographs were taken. He remembered that the shooting
occurred shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador

Room he scouted the area in an effort to determine the entrance
and exits which Senator KENNEDY might utilize. He decided that
the most logical exit and entrance would be from the kitchen
area into the Embassy Room.

He recalled seeing HAL FILAN and WALLY FONG of the
local office of Associated Press in the Embassy Room. He does
not recall seeing them in the kitchen area where the Senator
was shot.

He recalled that Senator KENNEDY came on to the
podium in the Embassy Room for a speech. Mr. DREW took photographs
of KENNEDY from the stage. Mr. DREW then left the stage and
went behind the podium into a hallway and down to a small room.
He was looking for a sandwich at the time. He recalled that
this might have been a press room. He found e sandwich and then
went back out into the Embassy Room. He went around the room
to the television stands behind the crowd and took some additional
pictures. He then went into the kitchen area and asked for
water. He got a glass and filled it with ice from the ice “
machine. He recalls standing in the kitchen talking with
Reporter BORIS YARO of the Los Angeles Times. During the time
he spent in the kitchen looking for water, he recalled that he
walked almost to the back of the kitchen and then returned to
stand with YARO near the entrance of the kitchen. They heard
that Senator KENNEDY was coming off the podium. At this time,
he handed his glass of water to one of several KENNEDY girls that
were standing inside the entrance to the kitchen area so that he
could be ready to take photographs. Senator KENNEDY came into
the kitchen area and passed Mr. YARO, and then approached DREW.
Senator KENNEDY smiled and passed Mr. DREW who followed hin.
Mr. DREW's next impression was of a "movement of -people in the
far'end of thé kitchen.” He heard a noise similar to a
firecracker and then saw smoke. He looked up and "saw anrarm
with a gun pointed at me." He ducked. Mr. DREW recalled that
after he saw the smoke he noticed Senator KENNEDY's head sink.

He remembered hearing two shots, then a pause and then three

more shots. There may have been more shots, but this was his
impression at the time. Immediately thereafter, people

began pushing DREW back and he saw others lowering Senator
KENNEDY to the floor. The coat hews wearing was splashed with
drops of blood. At this point, he realized he was a photographer
and began taking photographs. He recalls taking some photographs
from the top of a nearby serving table. He recalled that some
other photographer took a photograph which showed Mr. DREW on

the serving table taking photographs.

Mr. DREW stated that he is retaining his sport coat
in a safe condition and with the blood spots still on it in the
event that it is needed at some future’ time by the authorities.

Mr. DREW did not see the Police Officers taking suspect

SIRHAN out of the area as during this period he was looking for

a phone to call his newspaper. He recalled that originally he
mentioned that he thought the suspect was dressed in some type

of blue jump suit, however, upon further reflection he believes
that he vas mistaken. He apparently received this impression of
a blue jump suit because he thought the suspect's clothes were
all one color and possibly bluish.

Mr. DREW took no photograph in the kitchen prior to
the shooting and he stated that he did not recall seeing suspect
SIRHAN or any woman in a polka dot dress in the kitchen prior to
the shooting. He did not recall seeing a woman in a polka dot
dress in the kitchen after the shooting.

He recalled seeing Reporter RON BENNETT of United Press
International in the kitchen after the shooting, but he can not
say if BENNETT was present when the shooting occurred.

Subsequent to the shooting, he and BORIS YARO proceeded
to the home address of suspect SIRHAN and took a number of photo-
graphs. He recalled that YARO discovered what appeared to be a
.22 caliber spent slug in a trash box at the back of the house.

It was leftthere for the Police. Mr. DREW recelled pointing the
items out to a Police Officer who picked it up. Mr. DREW

recalled that he also took a photograph of a bullet found in the
garage at the house which was being placed in a bag by a Policeman.

He left the Embassy Room shortly after hearing this
individual and he went out into the lobby of the hotel
where numerous people were milling around and talking about
the shooting. He heard several other people in the audience
state something to the effect "We shot him." and from the
other conversations he was able to determine that they meant
that the people were the cause of Senator KENNEDY being shot
and it was in this context that they said, "We shot him."

ELLIS stated that while he was touring the hotel
with SHAMEL during the evening of June 4, 1968, he noticed
that there were quite a few shoddily dressed individuals in
the hotel.

10:00 p.m. on June 4, 1968, He was unable to describe
the clothing that SIRHAN had on at the time, but only
recalls he did not fit in with other individuals in the

and a jacket. At the time he observed SIRHAN, SIRHAN
was standing alone. He did not notice anyone else in SIRHAN's
company.

DAVID MARK ESQUITW was interviewed concerning his
knowledge as to why ROBERT F, KENNEDY, after speaking to those
gathered in the Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hutel, apparently
changed his plans as to the direction of his exit from the podium,
and left the stage at a point different from that where he entered.

He stated he was standing at the foot of the stairs
on the right side of the stage, as one faces the stage, when
ROBERT F. KENNEDY entered the Embassy Room, and as KENNEDY
started up the stairs onstage, he, ESQUITW, reached out and
shook hands with Senator KENNEDY, saying "Congratulations", or
something to that effect. KENNEDY made some brief reply,
such as "Thank You, son", and continued onto the stage.

During Senator KENNEDY's speech, ESQUIT& stood at
the foot of the stairs up which Senator KENNEDY had gone.

He said he had not known from which direction KENNEDY
planned to enter the room until he actually entered the room.
He said JIM LOWE was very deeply involved in the KENNEDY
campaign organization and had apparently been in on Some of the
planning for the Senator's appearance. LOWE, he believed, had
done some coordinating work between the KENNEDY group on the
fifth floor and the people waiting in the Embassy Room.

It was ESQUITH's recollection that LOWE was in the
KENNEDY party as that party mounted the stage, but he did not
know at what point yowm had joined the KENNEDY group. About
a minute or two before Senator KENNEDY concluded his speech,
someone, ESQUITH believed LOWE, told him Senator KENNEDY was
going to exit from the left rear of the stage, as one faces
the stage, and eo through the kitchen area, rather than have
to try to fight his way back through the huge crowd in the
Embassy Room. He said there was so much confusion he is not
even sure it was LOWE who told him this, The reason he was told,
according te ESQUITH, was because he and other KENNEDY workers

had taken it upon themselves to try to clear a path for the
Senator's entry and exit, and he was in no position to get to
the rear of the stage to attempt to clear a path there.

ESQUITH said he was not told, and does not know for
sure what the original exit plans were, but assumes they were
different than those which were eventually worked out, because
LOWE, or whoever talked to him about this, indicated the exit
to the left and rear was a change in plans. He said he does
not know who told LOWE about this change in plans, if, in fact,
it was LOWE who had passed this information on to him.

RAFER LEWIS JOHNSON, 5470 West Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California, telephone No. 294-1270, furnished the
following information to SAs JAMES CAGNASSOLA, JR., and JAMES
W. WOOD of the Federal Bureau of Investigation:

JOHNSON arrived at the Ambassedor Hotel, 3400 Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles, Celifornia, 8 PM, on June 4, 1968.
JOHNSON met two personel friends and escorted them to the
Embassy Room in the Ambassador Hotel. At 8:30-8:45 PM, JOHNSON
went to the suite of rooms occupied by Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY
and his staff which were located on the fifth floor of the hotel.
Upon arrival at the suite, he spoke with BILL BARRY, Senator
KENNEDY's bodygward . JOHNSON asked BARRY when the Senator was
going downstairs to make a speech, but BARRY could not supply
this information at that time. JOHNSON told BARRY to let him
know when the Senator planned to leave. JOHNSON waited in the
KENNEDY suite and spoke with Mrs. ETHEL KENNEDY and other friends.

At approximately 11 PM, Senator KENNEDY went to the
fourth floor of the hotel and was interviewed on television.
Immediately thereafter he returned to the fifth floor and was
interviewed in a television studio which was set up on that
floor. JOHNSON accompanied KENNEDY during the interview.
Senator KENNEDY returned to his suite approximately at-11:20 PM
and at that time JOHNSON left the group and visited with his
friends in the Embassy Room.

JOHNSON explained that entry into the Embassy Room was
restricted to people who had passes. He recalled that the
"press" had green passes and that the KENNEDY staff and possibly
campaign workers were issued red passes. There also may have
been other colored passes in use. Security guards were stationed
at the main entrance to the Embassy Room. He recalls that there
was an entrance to this room on the south side which was being
used by the major television networks. There were no guards
on this door.

After completing his visit in the Embassy Room, JOHNSON
returned to the fifth floor at 11:40-11:45 PM, and asked BILL
BARRY when the Senator would go downstairs. Since BARRY did not
know the time of departure, JOHNSON joined the other guests in
the KENNEDY suite.

At midnight or shortly afterwards the KENNEDY party,
consisting of approximately 30 people began to leave the suite.
The group included Senator KENNEDY, ETHEL KENNEDY, JESSE UNRUH,
"TUCK" (complete name unknown), ROOSEVELT GRIER, Mr. (FNU) WILSON
of CBS, "STAN" (LNU) of Look Magazine, and BILL EPPRIDGE (phonetic)
of Life Magazine. The party also consisted of other newsmen,
camera men and writers whoseidentity are unknown.

Senator KENNEDY left his suite in the company of
BARRY and JOHNSON. The group walked down the hallway to the
right from the Senator's room and turned in the first corridor
to the right. They waited for an elevator, however, when it
arrived it was occupied by other passengers. Senator KENNEDY
got onto the elevator and then immediately got off since he
realized that there was not sufficient space to accommodate his
party. The KENNEDY party then moved to another elevator on the
same floor and Senator KENNEDY also got on it and left this
elevator for the same reason as stated above. Thereafter the
KENNEDY party went around the corner and turned left and were
proceeding in the direction of the freight elevator. JOHNSON
recalls that the elevator operator who was wearing an unrecalled
uniform was standing near the elevator door. He is not certain
who decided to take this elevator, however, he did not think
that it was strange that a freight elevator would be used since
most of the people in the KENNEDY party had used this elevator
previously. JOHNSON could not furnish any description of the
elevator operator other than to say he was not a Negro male.

LA 56-156

When the party entered the elevator, JOHNSON recalls
seeing Senator KENNEDY, ETHEL KENNEDY, JESSE UNRUH, BILL BARRY
and ROOSEVELT GRIER. He does not know who instructed the elevator
operator to take them to a specific floor. When the elevator
stopped and the doors opened JOHNSON observed that they were in
the kitchen or serving area of the hotel and he presumed that it
was the same floor where Senator KENNEDY was to make his speech.

JOHNSON does not remember who was off the elevator
first, but it may have been the men from Life and Look Magazines.
BARRY was leading Senetor KENNEDY. JOHNSON was following
behind the Senator and ROOSEVELT GRIER with Mrs. KENNEDY was
behind him. After leaving the elevator Senator KENNEDY stopped
when a man dressed in a white uniform,presumably a kitchen
worker,reached across the table to shake his hand. JOHNSON
moved toward this individual and raised his arm to keep him
away. The Senator reached across JOHNSON's arm and shook hands
with this man. Senator KENNEDY then moved approximately 15 feet
ahead and shook hands with a white female who was dressed in a
white uniform. The Senator then moved ahead five feet and
greeted another male kitchen worker. The Senator may have also
shaken hands with a fourth kitchen employee. JOHNSON is unable
to recognize any of the imen who shook hands with Senator KENNEDY
but said he could recognize the woman employee.

When Senator KENNEDY finished shaking hands with the
kitchen employees, BARRY led him to the Embassy Room. The hallway
or corridor which the group was walking through was very crowded
with television cameras, KENNEDY workers and KENNEDY staff embers.
The Senator was walking ahead of the group with BARRY. JOHNSON
and Mr. and Mrs. GEORGE PLINPTON became separated from the
Senator because some member of a CBS camera crew was pulling a
cable in the corridor and blocked their passage for a few moments.

JOHNSON observed Senator KENNEDY enter the Embassy
Room through a door way which was crowded with people. He then
proceeded on to the stage. JOHNSON recalls that the stage was
surrounded by a curtain and that if the stage was viewed from
the center of the ballroom, Senator KENNEDY would have entered
the right side of the stage. During this time BARRY and JOHNSON
were standing together and he questioned BARRY as to how the
Senator planned to leave the stage upon the conclusion. of the
speech. BARRY indicated that the exit would be made the same
way as they previously entered the stage. Shortly before the
end of KENNEDY's speech, BARRY moved towards the Senator.
Senator KENNEDY turned from the podium and started towards the
side of the stage by which he had previously entered. Senator
KENNEDY paused for a moment and then turned to the opposite
direction (left side of stage). JOHNSON could not see whether
the Senator continued to the far left of the stage, but did
notice that his direction of travel was slightly towards the
rear. JOHNSON realized that the Senator was leaving the stage
py a different way and attempted to reach him but because of
the crowd he could. not move forward. JOHNSON, in the company of
Mrs. PLIMPTON, walked to the back of the stage (right side)near
the corridor and joined Senator KENNEDY as he walked past. JOHNSON
is unaware as to why KENNEDY left the stage in a different
direction.

As Senator KENNEDY walked past JOHNSON, he noticed that
BARRY and unrecalled other individuals were in front of the
Senator. Between Senator KENNEDY and JOHNSON, who were approximately
five feet apart,there was a camera man and a sound man, identities
unknown. JOHNSON and Mrs. PLIMPTON continued to follow Senator
KENNEDY through a darkened area and at a point, three or four
feet from an opened double doorway with a divider in the center,
JOHNSON heard a sound which reminded him of a bursting balloon.
A second or two later, JOHNSON heard a second similar sound and
looking in the direction where he assumed the Senator should have
been, he saw smoke and fragments of paper in the air. The area
in front of JOHNSON was brightly. lit possibly by camera lights.
After hearing the second noise, JOHNSON immediately assumed that |
these noises were gunshots.:. JOHNSON immediately moved forward pushing

people aside,Due to the great number of people in the area
forward movement was seriously impaired. As he passed through

the open double doors he saw BARRY hit and push a white male who
was standing on the floor in front of him (JOHNSON) but

slightly to the right. JOHNSON continued to push forward and
observed s wounded man lying on the floor in front of the doorwey.
He saw blood on this person's forehead and also thought that he
saw a bullet hole in the top of his head. JOHNSON then observed
Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor in the same area. The
Senator was lying on his back in an almost flat position but
looked as if he was struggling to get up. His left arm was on
the floor, his right arm moved from a down position beside his
head through an arch and down to his side. JOHNSON saw blood

on the floor beneath the right side of Senator KENNEDY's head.

He also saw blood on tne right side of KENNEDY's head below the
ear and extending down the right cheek and down the right side of
his chest. Senator KENNEDY looked at JOHNSON and they stared

at each other for a moment.

JOHNSON wes then deciding whether to assist the Senator
or proceed towards BARRY who was attempting to subdue thé-white
male who JOHNSON assumed had been firing the gun. He approached
this individual and observed that he was still holding a gun
in his hand. JOHNSON does not recall if the gun was being held
in the right or left hand. Other unrecalled individuals were
trying to seize the weapon and at this time the assailant was
pushed back against a table. JOHNSON lunged at the man and
grasped the front part of the gun with his left hand. ROOSEVELT
GRIER had the buttend of the gun in his hand. The assailant still
had his finger in the trigger housing. GRIER twisted the gun
from this individual's hands and at the same time JOHNSON tightly
held this person's body. JOHNSON then turned towards Senator
KENNEDY and saw that BARRY was now at his side.

LA 56-156

At the same time that JOHNSON was holding the
assailant, ROOSEVELT GRIER was holding the man around the
weist and by the left leg. GEORGE PLIMPTON was holding the
man's right arm and was holding his right side. A hotel
employee ,wwho JOHNSON described as having a fair complexion with
a sunburn, was holding the assailant around the neck. Another
hotel employee who appeared to be an Italian or Armenian was also
holding this individual. At this time a male voice said,
"Let me have the gun. Let go ROSIE", (meaning ROOSEVELT GRIER).
"Let go RAFER.'" JOHNSON then shouted to this individual who
was speaking, "shut up". JOHNSON then shouted to GRIER, "ROSIE
let me have the gun." The male voice then said, "Let RAFER have
the gun." JOHNSON then repeated to GRIER, "ROSIE give me the
gun", and GRIER complied with his request. JOHNSON placed the
gun in his left pocket and released his grip on the assailant.
JOHNSON remained next to this man and while he was standing
there said to this individual "Why did you do it?" The man did
not answer. JOHNSON, moving his face directly in- front of the
assailant and looking directly into his eyes repeated "Why did you
do it?" The man did not respond. JOHNSON then clenched his
fist and placed the back of his fist on the assailant's forehead.
JOHNSON then repeated, "why did you do it?" The assailant
answered "I'll explain ,it." The assailant did not speak any
other words while he was in JOHNSON's presence. Several minutes
later, JOHNSON observed two unif®med Police Officers approaching
and he left the assailant and moved to where Senator KENNEDY
was laying. Two men with a stretcher were with the Senator and
ETHEL KENNEDY said to them "Don't move him, Don't lift him".
JOHNSON heard the Senator say "no don't." The Senator was then
-placed on the stretcher and taken to the freight elevator. JOHNSON
stood guard at the elevator door and only allowed the KENNEDY
family and a few other people to enter the, elevator, JOHNSON wanted
to remain with the Senator so he ran from the kitchen area into
the lobby and took the nearest elevator to the fifth floor where
he assumed Senator KENNEDY would be taken. Since he did not
find the Senator on the fifth floor, he returned to the ground
floor of the hotel and found the area where the ambulances were
parked. He then learned that the Senator was taken to the

hospital and he with Deputy Mayor QUINN went to Central Receiving
Hospital in CUINN's automobile. At the hospital, Police Officers
éllowed.him to enter’ at OUINN's direction and he saw Senator
KENNEDY. While in the hospital a Police Officer asked JOHNSON
for the asailant's gun and JOHNSON denied that he had the

weapon. He then saw two men whom he recognized as Police
Detectives. JOHNSON told these men that he had the assailant's
gun and asked if Chief THOMAS REDDIN was at the hospital. One

of the detectives told JOHNSON that REDDIN was not present, but
that they would take possession of the gun. JOHNSON informed

the detectives that he would only surrender the gun at Police
Headquarters. The detectives thereafter transported JOHNSON

to Good Samaritan Hospital and accompanied him to the floor
where Senator KENNEDY was being treated. The same detectives
then drove him to the Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters
and at this time JOHNSON surrendered the gun. The gun was given
to Sergeant CALKINS and Sergeant MC GANN who are assigned

to the Los Angeles Police Department Detective Bureau, 150

North Los Angeles Street, Los Angeles, California.

JOHNSON said that the assailent's gun was a revolver,
black in color with brown grips. The barrel of the gun was

approximately four inches long. JOHNSON was unable to recall
the caliber of this weapon.

JOHNSON stated that he has seen photographs of SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN in the newspaper and on television and SIRHAN is
the same person who he helped to subdue following the shooting
of Senator KENNEDY and others on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador
Hotel. JOHNSON is certain that he did not see SIRHAN in the
hotel or elsewhere prior to the time he helped to subdue him.

JOHNSON does not recall seeing a woman wearing a
white dress with polka dots either prior to or after the
shooting. He did not see anyone run from the kitchen area after
the shooting occurred.

He explained that the kitchen or serving area was very
crowded and that when the first shots were heard people immediately
fell to the floor or attempted to hide to keep out of the line
of fire.

JOHNSON said that he is certain that he heard at least
four shots. The first shot was followed one or two seconds
later by a second shot. The second shot was followed by a
‘string of shots", exact number unrecalled. No shots were fired
while JOHNSON was attempting to seize the assailant's gun.

and observed an ambulance leaving the hotel, Since his
automobile was parked in a good position to leave the
Ambassador Hotel, he was able to leave the area just as it was
being blocked off. He followed the ambulance to the

Central Receiving Hospital, 1401 West Sixth Street, Los
Angeles and observed geveral photographers who were already
on the scene when he arrived. He was able to obtain several
photographs of Senator KENNEDY as he was being removed from
the ambulance. A short time thereafter, as Senator KENNEDY
was removed to the Good Samaritan Hospital, he was able to
take some more photographs of him,

He advised that all of his photographs were
carried by messenger to his Los Angeles UPI office, and
thereafter the negatives were forwarded to UPI headquarters
in New York City. He advised copies of these negatives
could be obtained by the FBI from the New York UPI headquarters.

KENNERLY advised that the above information is true
and correct to the best of his knowledge and that it portrays
his personal observations of Senator KENNEDY at the Ambassador
Hotel on June 4 and 5, 1968. He stated he can furnish no
further information than that already related above,

the podium I went to'the lobby and then to the
main kitchen. As I was walking into the
kitchen I heard several reports. At the
time —.shought these reports were:ballosns
bursting or firecrackers. I cannot recall how
many reports or in what sequence. I was
standing at the corner of the entrance to the
kitchen from the pantry way, at the corner of
the kitchen nearest the Embassy Room. Senator
Kennedy was moving down the pantry way toward |
me at about a distance of 25 to 30 feet. At the
time I heard the reports I saw the Senator
lurch. At that point the Senator disappeared
from my view, and a male voice, either beside or

"moving back and forth. I did not see the person
who had fired the shots. I immediately pushed my
way through the crowd to the Bell Captain's Desk
to use the telephone. However, as I reached the
phone I found that Pat Murphy, our Security Guard
was on the phone telling the operator to contact
the police and to have an emergency ambulance
sent to the hotel.

I then went back to the pantry way. There
was a great wrestling of people going on and I
could see people standing around or looking down
on others who were apparently injured. I ran
back to the Bell Captain's phone and told Ruby,
the switchboard supervisor who was on duty, to
call additional ambulances and police because I
thought from the number of people involved and
their violent actions that many more people were
injured. I think my exact words were,
"my God, they're slaughtering each other".

"T went back to the kitchen and I saw a
man on the steam table in the pantry way and
a large colored fellow lying across him. The
gun, a very small gun, being held up in the
air, pointed toward the ceiling. It was my
impression that the gun was béing held by the
man lying on the steam table. I did not see
the face of the man on the steam table at
that time. I then left the scene and returned
to my desk in the lobby, where I locked my
phone. While I was putting the lock on my
phone a Los Angeles police officer brought a young
man whose hands were handcuffed behind him
past my desk, past the public phones and the
two disappeared from my view down the corridor
leading to Executive Suites A & B. The man
in custody appeared to be of Mexican extraction,
in his early twenties, 5 foot 6 or 7 inches,
medium dark complexion, dark hair, dressed in a
bluish-grey dress shirt with sleeves rolled up
and wearing dark trousers.

"I was then kept busy in the lobby trying to
maintain some semblance of order. After what
seems like 20 to 30 minutes I saw about 6 or 7
police officers bring a man, a Caucasian who
was short with dark hair in his early twenties
out of the pantry way, through the lobby and
down the stairs to the bottom floor. I was
standing at the head of the stairs where the
officers with the suspect passed me at an
approximate distance of two or three feet. I
was amazed at the calm demeanor of the suspect.

"The individual with police, the suspect,
looks just like the photo of Sirhan Bishara

"After Senator Kennedy completed his speech
myself Rafer Johnson & several others began clearing
a path for Senator Kennedy through the pantry and
into the kitchen. I stopped at the double doors
leading to the kitchen & at the door on my left which was
open & clear. This is the door that Senator Kennedy
walked through preceeded by Rafer Johngon, Rosy Grier,
Paul Shieb and several others. I stopped at the
door in order to keep it clear & also to allow Bill
Barry & Fred Dutton to catch up to Senator Kennedy.

"At this point Senator Kennedy's wife Ethel
came through the door at which time I began to
accompany her in order to keep a path clear for her
to reach or join the Senator,

"Immediately after she came through this door
I heard gun fire, at least 4 rapid shots, at which
time I immediately turned to cover Ethel Kennedy,
picked her up bodily & carried her back through the
door to the pantry area. I stayed with her & held
her till I thought it was safe to let her go. I
then did so and Mrs. Kennedy went back through the
door to the kitchen and I went to the Embassy Room
to check on my wife's welfare as she & friends were
near the stage. I then attempted to secure medical
help for anyone who might have been hurt.

18 of the 25 individuals that were part of the Kennedy Advance
Party, but that he did not recognize the individual who gave
him the order to clear a path for Senator KENNEDY to the
Colonial. Room for the press conference. He stated that this

5 feet $ inches, tall, had a medium build, Light brown hair,
and was wearing a business suit. He said this individual
seemed to know what he vas doing and where he was going and
it appeared “as though some of the members of the Kennedy
Campaign Staff did know this individual. LOWE stated that he
Saw numerous individuals in the pantry and kitchen area just
prior to the time that Senator KENNEDY was shot that did not
have press passes nor were they part of the Kennedy Campaign
Staff. Hence, they technically should not have been in that
area. He stated that he did observe a hotel fecurity Guard

WILLIAM (BILL) V, MANNISS, 8041 Fordham Road, Los
Angeles, California, telephone 645-1929, advised that he was
on Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY's staff, MANNISS had no specific
title but his job was taking care of the manifest for the air-
plane and taking care of luggage and office equipment.
He had previously worked for Continental Airlines in Los
Angeles and is presently on leave of absence from that
organization.

MANNISS stated that when the KENNEDY party came
to Los Angeles, he was staying at his residence, but the
rest of the staff was residing at the Ambassador Hotel.
On June 4, 1968, at about 9:00 p.m., MANNISS and his wife
PEGGY B. MANNISS arrived at the Ambassador Hotel. They
had come straight from their home to the Ambassador Hotel
and had parked about three blocks south of Eighth Street,
because the parking lots were filled to capacity. The
MANNISS entered through the Eighth Street entrance and
proceeded to the victory speech.

There were about two hundred persons in the room
where the speech was to be held. MANNISS is not sure of the
name of the room, because he does not know the Ambassador
Hotel that well. PIERRE SALINGER announced twice that
Senator KENNEDY was coming down to the room to make a speech.
Senator KENNEDY however, did not come after either announcement,
probably because he wanted to make sure of the voting.
Senator KENNEDY finally arrived and spoke. He and his wife
turned to walk off the podium and MANNISS and his wife left
by a door on the other side of the room.from the Senator.
They left with American Airlines personnel.

MANNISS and his wife walked to his car, turned on the
radio and immediately heard about the shooting. They did not
re-enter the Ambassador Hotel because the radio said the entrances
had been blocked off so no one could enter or leave.

MANNISS further stated that he knew nothing about a
press conference and he had heard nothing of a change of plan
for Senator KENNEDY. It is possible, however, that his body-
guard could have changed the Senator's route downstairs,
pecause of the position of the crowd.

MANNISS was only at the Ambassador Hotel for the
victory celebration and knew nothing about any other type
of plans, While he was at the celebration, he saw nothing
unusual and can not remember anything that could possibly have
had to do with the shooting.
