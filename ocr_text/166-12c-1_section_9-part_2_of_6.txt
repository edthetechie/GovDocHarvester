it down-- I know that religion was a
tremendous factor. I do feel that most of
the Protestants, if I had to guess, felt
certainly that a Catholic had a right to

be President, but likewise, they were con-
‘cerned. They were a little bit afraid for
a Catholic to be President. We lost this
county, (Cabel County) Kennedy was defeated
and Humphrey won. I think Kennedy would
have won without question had he not been

a Catholic. But I think my prediction was
reasonably valid because we put the religious
issue to bed in West Virginia in 1960

with regard to presidential campaigns, I
believe. +“

Alfred Chapman, a West Virginia delegate at the 1950

Democratic National Convention, was quite specific on the antag-

onism that he personally encountered during the primary:

Young: What was the basis of the ridicule
and the smearing? What were the charges
leveled against you most frequently?
Chapman: That he was a Catholic, and Cath-
olics didn't have a chance. That I ought

to have been ashamed of myself for pushing
a Catholic for a high office of President...

“Young: Mr. Chapman, a minute ago while I jie

was changing the tape you mentioned that
you yourself were personally attacked by

this. Would you describe that, that you. oe et

were telling me?

Chapman: I was. Yes. The wife had received
telephone calls nearly every day in the
week for the entire years of 1959 and 1960.
Even after I came back from the Convention,
I was attacked very brutally. She would
receive telephone calls telling her to look
out the window, that two men in their white
coats were coming down to get mé with a
strait jacket. She said, "What, are you
talking about?" “Well,” he says, “he's a
nut. He's an idiot. He belongs in a nut 13
house because he's supporting Jack Kennedy."

Charles ki, Love Jr., an attoriuey-at-law, was in charge of
the fourteenth district, and discusses the peoplewho threatened
him; the pople who feared Aennedy’s connection with the Roman

Catholic Church:

Young: Did you ever experience any per-
sonal attacks or anonymous mail from anti-
Catholics because of your support for the
Senator?

Love: I really did. Do you want to see them?
I have many in my file. They weren't all
anonymous. Yes, I had a lot of anpnymous
attacks but I also had letters that were
signed by people-- people didn't make any
bones about signing them and sending them

to you,

Young: Well, while you're checking your :

file, could I ask you this question-- did cut

you have any anonymous phone calls? -
Love: Yes. Wea 4
Young: People just hang up-- call-and-- , oy
Love: Yes. Most of them were people apparently wh of
without much education or learning-- they'd

just call you up, curse you out-- call you pe

vile names. Some of them called me-- wr
Young: Did you get very many during the

course of the campaign? .

Love: Oh, yes-- many of them, I have some
letters that were signed--

Young: Mr. Love, would you please read an
excerpt from one or two letters or summarize
the general nature of the anti-Catholic
attacks which come to your attention at
least?

Love: Well, this attack came from people
all over the state-- I think from more or
less uneducated people generally, and then
a great deal of literature was mailed into
West Virginia from out of the state. I had
anonymous telephone calls and also people
would accost me on the street and talk to
me about it. One of the letters that I rec-
eived has this: "Your advocacy of the Kenn-
edy cause indicates clearly that you know
little indeed of the dark history of the



--- Page 3 ---
Roman Church per se, brilliant lawyer though
you may be. Why any good Protestant would

or could advocate the cause of any Cath-

olic for President of this great and pre-
dominantly Protestant nation, is, I confess, —
past my ken." Now I'm still quoting: "I

would reauest that you explain to me why

you would trust any Catholic after knowing.
that this young weakling rescinded his
acceptance at the dedicatory ceremony of

the Philadelphia chapel on orders of the
Roman Catholic bishop. Might he not as
President be equally dominated by the Church
masters, even though world-shocking decisions
were to be made. Wake up lir. Love, while

there is still yet time and vot for anybody lee
but Kennedy."-- and so forth. 14 rae het”

Michael Gretchen, who headed District Six, the area
comprised of the coal miners and the United Mine Workers Union,
was particularly enlightening even though this district was
pro-Kennedy and heavily Catholic. Religion was thus, not a

key issue in every district:

Young: Mike, there's something else that
always comes up in any discussion of the
1960 primary and that, of course, is the
issue of the president's religion. Since
this is a part of West Virginia which con-
tains greater number of members of the
Catholic faith, would you comment on his
religion as it affected the ¢ampaign in
this part of the state?

Gretchen: I don't think that religion aff-
ected the campaign one way or the other,
but of course the majority of the Catholic
people in this area were glad to see a man
like Kennedy running for the presidency.
But there were people in this area who
were more or less against Catholics but
they were 100% for Kennedy. It seemed like
everybody was out for him because Senator

sennedy impressed them that he was a good
man and would make a good president, and
religion, in my opinion, did not enter
into the campaign.

John Chernenko also denied that religion was a major

factor in the primary. But here again, it is important to

note that Chernenko was county chairman of Brooke County,

very cosmopolitan and more liberal county. His reference to
a RR er
Boston agitators creating the religious conflict, was quite

interesting to me:

Young: Well John, Brooke County is a county
that has a very cosmopolitan population,

a great many immigrants, of course, from
many different parts of Europe. How did
religion figure as an issue in this partic-
ular part of the state? In the primary
election?

Chernenko: Religion wasn't an issue in

our county.
Young: you mean there weren' ‘t then sermons

either for or against Kennedy, and there
were not...

Chernenko: There were a few crackpots who
would come in from Boston, but they didn't
stay too long.

Young: You mean these were the people that
were stirring UP. anti-Catholic sentiment?
Chernenko: Yes.+°

William Thaw, of Tyler County, which is basically rural
but middle class, brings us back to the embroiling conflict
of religion. His remarks seem to typify the prevailing
feeling of the voluminous interviews recorded:

Young: Did religion become an issue in

the c. campaign in Tyler Gounty?

Thaw: Yes, we had a very bad situation here,
where, I would say, those people who were
strong church people of the Frotestant
faith were very opposed to the President's
candidacy on a religious basis. And i ran
into a great deal of religious bigotry.
Young: Well, do you remember any of the
exact details of what they feared from

the possibility of a Catholic President?
Thaw: The old, old story, you know; the
Pope’ S going to run the White House-- this,
that, and the other. I am a memoer of the
Masonic lodge and I am a Shriner. I had

a member of the Masonic lodge come. to-me —
and ask me how I could support Kennedy aand
be a good Mason. Now, that's how bad it
got.

Young: Mayor Thaw, did you find the. ob-
jection on religious ground limited to

any particular denomination? Were some
denominations more tolerant and others less
tolerant?

Thaw: No, I think it was a general thing.

Y think the more fundamental the religion,
the more vigorous the opposition. Of
course, I still think, that after the votes
have been counted here in the primary--

I really believe, in. fact, not only in the
primary but in the general---I_ think in
the final analysis, those people who were
using religion against Kennedy were against
him anyway.

In an interview with Reverend Harley Evan Bailey of Wood
County, again the interviewer asked if any particular denom-
ination was more boisterous and vocal on the religious issue.
Bailey contends that the Baptist and Methodist denominations fick

these recorded interviews. Perhaps the most revealing deduction

was that religious bigotry was prevalent, especially in the
rural areas, where Catholics were either of a small percentage
or of no percentage at all. In fact, as the West Virginia
primary entered the final weeks, it appeared that there was
more concern among Protestants about Church pressures on a Uath-
olic candidate wnere there were almost no Catholics than there
were in areas with substantial number of Catholics. It seemed
that living and working among them as neighbors inclined people
to be less attentive to such remote considerations. The
phenomenon of assimilation throughout decades of American social
history was being pointed up. Not all of the staff leaders
witnessed this bigotry; the levels of religious intoleration
was dependent upon socio-economic boundaries.

There were four basic fears of the Protestants to a

Catholic President: (1) American Catholicism is not essentially

different from historic European Catholicism, and thus what

has happened in Spain could: happen here; (2) Catholics, when ra

strong enough, will seek preferential legislation: (3) A oft

' Catholic might have an allegiance above his allegiance to

the Constitution; and (4) We do not know what Catholics really

believe because there is so little communication with them. 2?
Such allegations demanded a personal response from Sen-

ator Kennedy: "When I swore to 'preserve, protect and defend'

the Constitution as Commander of a World War II PT boat lost

in action, no one said my religion made me ineligible; no one

has found a sinsle vote of mine in 14 years of Congressional
service which did not demonstrate complete independence of
action, and complete dedication to keeping church and state
separate. Time after time, I have answered every question,
differing with leaders of my own church and satisfied the leaders
20 °

of every other church."

It is pertinent to note that Kennedy had opposed a number —

of positions taken by Catholic organizations and members of
the hierarchy. He attented non-Catholic schools, from the
elementary grades to Harvard. In Congress, «ennedy favored aid
to Yugaslavia, aid to Communist sattelite states, and the nam-
ing of James B. Conant as our first ambassador to West Ger-
many. Some Catholic groups opposed the first two, and Catholics
generally bridled at Conant because of his opposition to paro-
chial schools as perpetuating a dual educational system he
believed unhealthy for America.

On a lighter note, on the night of the primary, Kennedy (|
went with his friend Ben Bradlee to a pornagraphic film. They ae
wondered aloud if the movie was on the Catholic index of for-
bidden films (it was), and whether or not there were any votes

in it either way for Kennedy in allegedly anti-Catholic West ‘

Virginia if it were known that he was in attendance. “+
The West Virginia primary resulted in a convincing victory

for the Senator from Massachusetts. In this 95% Protestant

‘state, Kennedy carried 61% of the vote and 48 out of the 55

counties, which lead many political observers to claim that
xennedy actually won the nomination in West Virginia rather
than in Los Angeles, because he deadened the one damaging
aspect of his vote-getting ability; his religion.
There were a myriad of reasons why Kennedy captured the
west Virginia primary. Bob Myers reflects on a few of these
reasons: "He spent hours ang days and days going to every nook
and cranny of vest Virginia, saw our problem, was tremendously
impressed by the gentleness of our people. Those of us that
know New Yorkers or New Englanders sometimes regard them as
harsh, so I think he was impressed py this gentleness and pol-
iteness that West Virginia had shown to him. He remarked’ on
that a number of times. But all in all, those of us that started
early were immediately captured by his personal magnetism, the
magnetism of his family as a total unit, and the total Kennedy
package. And through him this image was projected throughout
the state, I think Kennedy was our President."22,  ay- 4oe#4!
Chapman, First District delegate to the Democratic Nat-
ional Convention in Los Angeles, summarized in an interview,

the specific attraction that Kennedy had in West Virginia:

Young: Mr. Chapman, if you were to sun-
marize, what do you think were the chief
reasons for SenatofKennedy's victory

in the First District?

Chapman: He was forward; he was honest in
every statement that he made; he appealed
to the people the same as Woodrvow.wilson
appealed to the people in 1912.

22- Bob Myers, recorded interview by William Young, p.20.

Young: Can you think of anything that
senator sennedy advocated that had any
particular appeal in this part of west
Virginia? .e don't think of this. seetion

as being part of the Coalfield Appalachia.
Is there anything in the sennedy program
that was directed to You? :

Chapman: to eliminate poverty. |

Young: The poverty appeal had some affect

Chapman: That's right. That's right be-

here were left with their homes and no

The mines weren't operating steadily. There-
fore, he came with an appeal that he would
try to help the people in the state of
West Virginia, and wherever _it was neccess-
ary, in the United States.¢

Even though the primary was over, the ramifications of oy
the religious issue were still apparent. Yet in examining the
recorded interviews, there exists some discrepancy as to the im-
pact of Catholicism upon the general election. Myers claims
that there was a diminution of anti-Catholic feeling in West
Virginia by the general election because the people were proud
that they were able to participate forcibly in a general election
and that they had proven to the nation that West Virginia was
not a state of pigots.°*

However, Reverend Bailey claims that the people who were
opposed to Kennedy in the primary fought him even harder between
the primary and the general election. °9 Though there are contra-
dictions on this point, there was a trend after the primary for

state politicians to shy away from Kennedy on the Democratic

ticket. Here again, the evidence is not conclusive:

Young: ir. Bailey, do you think that the
Democratic politicians running. on the Dem-
ocratic ticket in the general election felt
that a Catholic at the head of the ticket
might pull votes away from them? Was there
any relunctance on the part of the guber-
natorial or senatorial candidates to be
associated with the national ticket in the
general election, because of the Presi-
dent's religion?

Rev. Bailey: There was a little shyness there
but I don't think.it amounted to a_whole
lot. I think that on the part of some,
there was the fact that they just wanted

to pull away, but as a whole, $,don’ +t

think that was too noticeable.

Charles Love's interview was a bit more enlightening
concerning state politician’s’reluctance to join the Kennedy
ticket. However, Love could only remember that before the
primary, sennedy received little support from the regular state
politicians running for re-election. It is hard to ascertain
whether this was out of an anti-Catholic sentiment or a:complete
abhorrence with Kennedy's stands on contemporary issues.

There was a very limited amount of documentation on the

: : {
role kennedy's Catholicism played in West Virginia after the ol? :

primary. The paucity of available information is regrettable.
Yet the impact during the primary is amply portrayed by the
interviews.

Kennedy's win in West Virginia, a victory for his precise



--- Page 11 ---
organizational support, and his addressing the issues in an
exhaustive campaign effort, was well-deserved. In addition,
political scientists who argued that. Kennedy should not have
risked his candidacy in West Virginia because of the divisive
religious issue, completely underestimated the charm of the
West Virginia voter. This voter, though well beneath the
median income. is fiercely proud and patriotic. - sennedy's
identity with Roosevelt, the Navy and his promise to provide
relief in Appalachia if elected President, provided Kennedy
with the key to victory.

Kennedy won the nomination in west Virginia when he proved

to the nation that a Catholic could win in a non-Catholic

Mr. President:
I ask of you one simple question. Do you, have any plans to
answer _the questions still left by the murder of President John ;
__Kennedy? 1f so, do you plan to restate past lies, or look for the
facts? 1 have grave doubts about the validity of the Warren
Commission's findings that Oswald was the lone assassin. I see no
justificatiication for the Goverment's policy of keeping evidence
locked up in the national capital and Archives; nor can I condone
the autopsy x-rays and photographs. These questions must be answered
before your office can brake the strings of military dominace. -
These questions must be answered before people will once again
believe in freedom and justice for all. There are many people with
a particular: intrest to these unanswered questions. People that
write to you asking "Who really runs our country?" really have an
intrest to know. 1 hope you have the courage to stand for total
morality. I am very pleased, as are otners 1 have talked with, at
your effort to control the military empire that visably runs our

country. Please think on these matters.
Thank you very much,

Re: the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy

AS DSION

As a concerned citizen, and being intimately knowledgeable about many of the
circumstances surrounding the assassinations within our country during the past
decade and a half, I consider it of paramount importance that the American people
be fully informed about the whole truths behind these history-altering tragedies.

Dear Mr, President:

For too long now, the uncertainties, half-truths, and blatant falsehoods
se events have led to widespread frustration and a disrespect for and
ack of faith in our governmental institutions,

The Robert Kennedy assassination was attendant with such obstructions by
local law enforcement officials. Proof of this was presented before the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors this very day, Because of this unacceptable situation,
I have called upon this senior government body to formally request that you assign
the United States Department of Justice to enter the Robert Kennedy assassination
matter forthwith, in order to separate fact from fiction through the use of object-
ive reasoning and logical hypotheses.

“In accord with this request, I implore your assistance through the directing
of the Attorney General to assume full and complete responsibility for the future
handling of this matter,

You may be assured of my cooperation and assistance if +" fm ful_ and
