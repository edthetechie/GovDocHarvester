PRESIDENT

The Honorable Fred R. Harris
The United States Senate
Washington, D.C.

Dear Fred:

The details of the Sirhan Sirhan case are extremely important
to me, and | can think of no better vehicle than the United
States Congress and Senate to obtain the answers to questions
| am outlining below:

1) How much taxpayer's money has been spent on
Sirhan to date exclusive of the $900,000 spent
on his trial in Los Angeles;

2) The amount of federal funds being used to subsidize
his family due to the cruelty imposed upon them by
the press;

3) Why the legal intanglements posed by Sirhan's
lawyers cannot be brought up and answered
immediately so the death penalty can be imposed
either in San Quentin or another appropriate institution.

In summary, I'd like to know the exact expense incurred by the
government to date, what the future holds, when we can expect
some action and exactly what the United States government plans
to do with the man who has been accused of the assasination of
Robert F. Kennedy.

Thanks for your indulgence. I'll look forw 0 your reply.

SinceAly,

few days, some officers were conducting interviews without
ever having seen the pantry, or accurate plans of it.

“A plot, plan, map, schematic, or whatever is applicable,
and a brief statement of facts should be laid out, reproduced
and made available to every department command, and
staff, and to the investigators assigned to conducting inter-
views,” Keene added. Pena recommended a “walk through
thé crime scene by every officer conducting interviews.”

The three supervising officers were also critical of “detec-
tive note-taking,” and failure to properly describe witnesses,
Polaroid photographs would have been useful, serving the
same purpose as Keene's recommendation that “there is no
place ja an operation of this type for handwritten reports.”
In short, the modern case of sound tape proved itself.

I would agree with these constructive criticisms of the
investigation. In retrospect, anything can be improved. Gen-
erally, however, I believe the department responded well in
those first hectic, confusing hours. Men like Hughes, Jordan,

Sillings, Sharaga, and many othcrs, took the first shock. So.

did citizens at the scene, men like Dr. Abo, Jesse Unruh, Karl
Uecker, Rosie Grier, Rafer Johnson and Juan Romero. They
responded without hesitancy.

On July 25, 1969, Special Unit Senator was finally and
of ially closed out. It had been in existence for more than a
yer and the ending marked the completion of the longest,
Jar; wt. and most expensive criminal investigation ever under-

c o . .
taken by the Los Angeles Police Department, possibly the
mo.t cxztensive investigation ever conducted by any local
Jaw cforcement agency.

On that date the voluminous SUS files, in four locked

302

cabinets, were shifted out of Room 803 in Parker Center for
storage. Contained in them is more than fifty thousand pages
of documentation and material evidence. Evidence too large
for the cabincts has been recorded by photography.

The Filing Guide to these records, drawer by drawer,
tells the broad story of people, places and events from the
birth of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan to the conclusion of his trial.
Beyond that, to the final posttrial investigations of the special

- Unit.
The: indexed story is a more intimate view into these files,
‘and shows, for example, that 4,818 separate interviews and
interrogations were conducted. The official correspondence,
daily logs, section reports, progress reports, gun and gun-
range reports, case preparations, conspiracy-potential inves-
‘tigations scem to be endless. To this small mountain of paper
may be added 155 items of booked evidence, 1,700 photo-
graphs, 190 recls of tape, and 20 reels of sixteen-millimeter

film.

Although I read the reports daily and met constantly with
Captain Brown and SUS team heads to explore one aspect
or another of the investigation, I was astonished by the * sheer
mass of the unit’s total

Dear Mr. Kleindienst:

Thank you for your letter of October 8th. [In all sin-
cerity, I very much appreciate your promptness and your
suggestion.

If I were in California, I probably would first direct
my request to the local authorities. However, as I am
in Washington and copies of the records sought are in
Washington, I must renew my request to you to examine
them here.

Further, the stated "policy" of the Department is one
thing; the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 are another.

Under the provisions of that statute, I believe I am
entitled to access to the nine (or ten) volumes in ques-
tion. And I am most hopeful that the Department of
Justice will make them available promptly without my
having to resort to litigation.

Most respectfully yours,

Bernard Fensterwald, Jr.

The records sought are an FBI file with respect to Sirhan
B. Sirhan.

If it were not for the fact that the file in question had
been made available to writer Robert Blair Kaiser, and
had not Mr. Kaiser made this fact known in his new book,
RFK Must Die, [please see Attachment], you might be in-
clined to answer that the records in question were within
an exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552. However, as they have been
made available to a commercial writer and are the basis,
at least in part, for his published book, we can see no
reason why they should not be made equally available to
our Committee, as 5 U.S.C. 552 require equality of treat-
ment in access to records.

Therefore, we hope that the records can be made available
without serious delay. . meee =

“Of course it does,” said Berman, wondering to himself just how the
satge could be persuaded to let that happen,

“And I've got some books,” said Jabara fiercely, “that ought to go in
tialence.”” :

“ld tike to have them right away,” said Berman. “And anything else
vsa've got on the subject.” ae

Jsbara smiled and relaxed enough to enjoy the greatest fried shrimp in
heen. “Okay,” he said. “Okay.”

“Here,” I said, pushing a plate at Jabara, “have a fortune cockie and sce
shat the fates have in store.”

Jabara took a sip of tea, opened his cookie carefully and burst into a
svar of laughter. He handed over a tiny scrap of paper imprinted with the
revage: “DON'T LET YOUR ENTHUSIASM OVERRIDE THE
&EALITY AROUND YOU.” Jabara laughed again.

While the lawyers settled down to the weary task of picking twelve jurors
4eJ six alternates, I continued to read the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
2ea's Office File 56-156, Bureau File No. 62-587. It was impressively
beavy, comprising at least_4,000_pages of reports from special agents all.
set the United States who looked into the case of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan

—“Hyen request oF the Attorney General of the United States under the

Cail Rights Act of 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.”

And it was well written. The report of the assassination itself by Ama-
<< O. Richards, Jr., of the Los Angeles office was a model of telegraphic
stuily.

AL approximately 12:15 a.m., 6/5/68, Senator ROBERT. F. KENNEDY

20m, Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles. As SEN-
ATOR KENNEDY and party were leaving Embassy Room through kitchen
ct. a series of shots were fired by an unknown individual, subsequently
sified as SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. SENATOR KENNEDY fell
2xsuatd onto floor, critically wounded with bullet in brain. SIRHAN wres-
nei to oor, disarmed and turned over to Los Angeles, California, police

TN reports gave me a chance to verify many of the associations Sirhan

SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
N.&D.D, SEC.

a.

An arrest report of the Sierra Madre Police Depart-
ment dated September 23, 1970, shows that Saidallah Bishara
Sirhan, brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, had been arrested
on September 23, 1970, by the Sierra Madre Police Department,
in charges of suspicion of possession of marijuana.

Arrest report of the Sierra Madre Police Department
dated September 23, 1970, shows that Saidallah Bishara Sirhan
was arrested at Lime and Sierra Madre Boulevard and charged
with violations of Sections 11530 (Possession of Marijuana),
and 11910 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) of the California
Health and Safety Code. The address of Saidallah Sirhan was
listed in this report as 1659 North Lake, Number seven, Pas-
adena, California.

According to the arrest report Saidallah Sirhan
and two other suspects were in a vehicle when an attempt was
made by a Sierra Madre police officer to stop the vehicle for
a traffic vfolation. While attempting to stop the vehicle,

a plastic bag containing a green leafy substance resembling
marijuana, was thrown from the vehicle. During the inventory
of Saidallah Sirhan's property additional contraband was
found.

According to the crime report of this incident, the
arresting officer observed a vehicle driven by Saidallah Sir-
han on which the license plate light was inoperative. The
vehicle was being driven erratically and while attempting to
halt the vehicle, the arresting officer observed a plastic
bag expelled from the left front window of the car. This was
later retrieved and found to contain a green leafy substance
resembling marijuana.

SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN

The three suspects were arrested and transported
to the Sierra Madre Police Department for booking. While
removing personal belongings from Saidallah Sirhan a tin
foil wrapper containing five blue-green capsules of a white
powdery substance were observed to fall from his folded up
shirt sleeve.

Saidallah Sirhan was arraigned on September 23,
1970, in Division Two, Pasadena Municipal Court. A prelim-
inary hearing was set for October 2, 1970, in Division One
of the same court.

On October 2, 1970, the case against Saidallah
Sirhan was dismissed as there was insufficient information~
to link the defendant with the evidence.
