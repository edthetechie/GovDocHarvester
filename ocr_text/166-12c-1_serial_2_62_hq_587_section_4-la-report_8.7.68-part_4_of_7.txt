On June 25, 1968, Mrs. SPEAR (LEILA) SAYEGH, 2035
Vista Street, Sierra Madre, was contacted in an effort to locate
her husband, SPEAR SAYEGH, operator of the GPS Pharmacy, Temple
City, California, who was not at home. Mrs. SAYEGH stated
neither she nor her husband knew SIRHAN SIRHAN, but were slightly
acquainted with his brother, ADEL SIRHAN, who entertained by
playing a musical instrument.

Mrs. SAYEGH stated she wished she had known SIRHAN, as
she was sure anyone who was closely acquainted with Jordanian
Arabs,as a group,would never have been involved in shooting a
political figure, particularly not Senator KENNEDY, She stated
most Arabs, both in the United States and in the Middle East, had
a warm feeling toward the KENNEDYs, whom they believed had a
good understanding of the situation there. Mrs. SAYEGH stated all
the Arabs she knew were greatly distressed that an Arab was
responsible for the death of Senator KENNEDY, and she felt SIRHAN
had hurt the cause of Middle Eastern Arabs greatly.

Mrs. SAYEGH stated her husband headed the United States
Organization for Medical and Educational Relief, which is the
only tax-exempt charitable organization for the benefit of Arabs
in the Middle East. She stated neither she nor her husband had
ever met SIRHAN through this organization, or otherwise.

Mrs. SAYEGH believed the name of the man who used to head the
Organization of Arab Students, or at least an organization
for Arab students, was one MUSA SABA. She did not know him,
or where he might be located, and knew nothing concerning the
group.

JOSEPH SHEEHAN, Professor of Psychology, University
of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), was contacted at his
residence 371 20th Street, Santa Monica, and he furnished
the following information:

On the night of May 24, 1968, ‘he and his wife,
MARGARET, attended a rally for Senator ROBERT F,. KENNEDY
at the Sports Arena, Los Angeles. This rally ended around
10:30 p.m. anc SHEEHAN and his wife made their way out of
the Arena to a position where they could get a look at
Senator KENNEDY as he was leaving the Arena. SHEEHAN was
waiting about a half hour for Senator KENNEDY and a large
crowd, in excess of 200 people, had also gathered to wait
for the Senator.

About that time SHEEHAN noticed that the man.who
had moved in front of him,was completely out of character in
the crowd. This man appeared very intense and sinister, and
did not participate at all in the carnival atmosphere that
pervaded the crowd. This man appeared to SHEEHAN to be alone,
inasmuch as he did not talk with anyone in the crowd and
after two or three minutes he moved away and was lost b
SHEEHAN in the crowd. However, as this man moved away, SHEEHAN
remarked to his wife as to the sinister demeanor of this man.
His wife agreed. SHEEHAN reiterated that he lost this individual
in the crowd and did not see him again that evening.

Two days after the assassination of Senator KENNEDY,
SHEEHAN saw a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN in the Los Angeles
Times and he identified the photograph in the newspaper as
being the picture of the sinister individual who had been in
front of him outside the Los Angeles Sports Arena on May 24,
1968. SHEEHAN showed this picture to his wife without any
explanatory statements and she too, without prompting, identified
the photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN as being the picture of the
man in front of them in the Sports Arena.

SHEEHAN observed a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN
taken by the Los Angeles Police Department on June 5, 1968,
and he identified the person pictured as being the person
who was in frent of him in the crowd outside the Sports
Arena on May 24, 1968.

Approximately half an hour after SHEEHAN lost
SIRHAN SIRHAN in the crowd, Senator KENNEDY left the Sports
Arena in the company of ROOSEVELT GRIER and RAFER JOHNSON,
and other unknown members of the KENNEDY entourage. While
the entourage was attempting to clear a path to Senator
KENNEDY's awaiting automobile, which SHEEHAN observed was
parked on Exposition Boulevard, SHEEHAN noted that a group
of four men were concertedly attempting either,to impede
the progress of the entourage by not giving ground before
it, or were simply attempting to withstand the crowd in
order to get a better view of the Senator. In any event
the KENNEDY entourage was momentarily halted by the bottle-
neck of people before GRIER and JOHNSON moved in the direction
of least resistance and took Senator KENNEDY to the awaiting
automobile. SHEEHAN could not recall the four men other than
that they all appeared to be white Americans and to be well
dressed. SHEEHAN did not see SIRHAN SIRHAN in the company
of these men, nor does SHEEHAN have any reason to associate
SIRHAN SIRHAN with these men. :

SHEEHAN commented that he did not know any person
in the crowd outside the Sports Arena on the night of May eu,
1968, other than his wife.

SHEEHAN concluded that on the night of June 4, 1968,
he and his wife were at the Ambassador Hotel arriving there
about 8:30 p.m. They spent the entire evening in the Grand
Ballroom, leaving about 11:30 p.m., and he did not see SIRHAN
SIRHAN or Senator KENNEDY that night.

JOHN A, SWEDE was interviewed at the Los Angeles
office of the FBI. Mr. SWEDE said he and his wife,
CONRADINA MARIE FABREY DE JONGE SWEDE, were on a honeymoon
during the month of May and part of the month of June 1968.
He said during this honeymoon, he and his wife visited
Europe and countries in the Middle East and Southwest Asia.
On Friday, May 17, 1968, they were on an Iraqi Airline
flight from Cairo to Tehran. They landed in Baghdad: at
about 5:00 p.m., and they missed the connecting flight
from Baghdadto Tehran. The Iraqi 4 iyline made arrangements
for he and his wife to spend the night at the Ambassador
Hotel in Baghdad. He said he and his wife checked in at
the hotel shortly after they found out that they had missed
the connecting flight. At the hotel they went directly to
theiy room where they stayed for about an hour. He said
they made inquiry regarding a place to eat and found out
that the hotel had a dining room.

Mr. SWEDE said that he and his wife arrived at
the dining room in the hotel at about 7:10 p.m. He described
the dining room as being one flight above the ground floor,
and the only dining room located in the hotel. He said
that he and his wife were the only persons in the room at
the time that they arrived. He estimated that the dining
room had about 35 to 40 dining tables. After they were
seated at a table, a waiter came up and said, "You have
heard KENNEDY has been shot." Mr. SWEDE said he assumed
the waiter was referring to JOHN F. KENNEDY and said the
name JOHN F. KENNEDY. The waiter said, "Oh no, his brother
ROBERT." Mr. SWEDE said he was surprised to hear this and
answered, "Shot?" The waiter said, "Yes, with a gun .....
how else, in the head."

Mr. SWEDE said the waiter spoke in broken English,
and throughout his conversation he had a flaw in the use of
verb tenses. He said when the waiter said, "KENNEDY is
been shot," he assumed that it had already happened. He

said he asked the waiter how he knew this, and the waiter
answered with the words to the effect "..... I hear, I hear
on Arabic radio." Mr. SWEDE asked the waiter if the news
would be in the hewspaper , and the waiter answered with the
words to the effect "..... You can't read about it. On the
radio. dust today I find out." Mr. SWEDE said this
conversation took place just before the serving of the main
meal. During the time he served the main meal, the waiter
got off of the subject. The waiter asked personal questions
such as what he and his wiffe were doing in Baghdad and where
they were going.

Mr. SWEDE said he was successful in turning the
conversation back to the shooting of Senator KENNEDY, but
he was unable to get any further comment from the waiter
other than what he had already said. He said the waiter
left them pretty much alone while they were
eating. After their dinner and while the waiter was serving
coffee, he said the problem with the world is the "Jew."
The waiter said that the United States is dominated and
motivated by Zionists. He mentioned that all the candidates
are "pro Israel." Mr. SWEDE said the waiter was not specific
regarding names when he made this comment. He said he
recalled asking the waiter if the news about KENNEDY would
be on the radio that night, and the waiter said, "You will
hear nothing."

My. SWEDE described the waiter as being of either
Arabic or Iraqi descent, about 50 to 55 years of age, with
skin of medium color. He was of stout build and had black
hair and mustache with gray fleck. He said that there was
one other couple seated in the dining room at the time they
had dinner, and this couple came to the dining room while
he and his wife were in the process of consuming their meal.

Mr, SWEDE said that he and his wife were concerned
and slightly disturbed over the fact that the waiter had
told them that ROBERT KENNEDY had been shot. After dinner
they went to the main square inBaghdad to find a newspaper
that would have this news. They were unable to locate a
newspaper containing this news. He saidthey ~
listened to the radio that night for news about ROBERT
KENNEDY, and they heard none. He said ‘they left

Baghdad during Saturday morning, May 18, 1968. They flew

to Tehran. During that day they made inquiry concerning
the news that the waiter had told them on the previous
evening. He said he and his wife were unable to verify

the information given by the waiter. He said that they
figured that the news that the waiter gave them was nothing
but a rumor, and they thought nothing more of it.

He said during the afternoon of June 6, 1968,
they happened to be in Mersing, Malaysia, visiting .
a Peace Corps friend of theirs. Her last name is DAFFNEY.
DAFFNEY told them that she had just heard that ROBERT KENNEDY
had been shot in Los Angeles. He said he ‘his wife and
DAFFNEY listened to the radio that evening, and they had
heard that KENNEDY died. Mr. SWEDE said that
they were stunned, and they thought back to Friday evening,
May 17, 1968, and the information the waiter had given them
in Baghdad.

Mr. SWEDE said he was disturbed by the news he
had received from the waiter and thought it extremely odd
that the waiter had told him about KENNEDY being shot about
three weeks before he actually was shot. He said he notified
Mr. COFFEY, Information Officer at the American Embassy in
Singapore regarding this story.

Mr. SWEDE said he has no idea why the waiter made
the previously described comments regarding ROBERT KENNEDY.

He said that while they were on the Honeymoon,. ;
no other individuals made such comments fegarding him.

He said they returned to the United
States from their honeymoon on June 20, 1908, and they
currently reside at 1631 Camden Avenue, Los Angeles. He
added his wife, CONRADINA, has no other information to furnish
other than what he has given above.
