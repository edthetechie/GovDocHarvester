CIVIL RIGHTS

Persons shooting at San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte,
California, at same time as SITRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN on
6/4/68, recall SIRHAN practicing with .22 caliber pistol.
JESUS PEREZ, kitchen helper at Ambassador Hotel, Los
Angeles, advised that about 11:30 p.m., 6/4/68, he
observed man, later identified to him as SIRHAN BISHARA
SIRHAN, in pantry of Ambassador Hotel. SIRHAN asked

PEREZ several times if Senator KENNEDY would pass that
way as he left Embassy Room. PEREZ advised he told
SIRHAN that he did not know. PEREZ stated SIRHAN had

some type of papers in his hands and he did not see
“anyone else with SIRHAN, Other Ambassador Hotel employees
interviewed and unable to recall observing SIRHAN in

hotel prior to shooting. RAFER JOHNSON, who assisted

in subduing SIRHAN after shooting at Ambassador Hotel,
advised he asked SIRHAN immediately after shooting, "Why
did you do it?" After JOHNSON repeated the question
several times, SIRHAN answered, "I'll explain it."
JOHNSON did not see SIRHAN in Ambassador Hotel vrior to
shooting. JUDY MARIE ROYER, private secretary to former
California Governor EDMUND "PAT" BROWN, advised that
during evening of 6/4/68, about one or two hours before
Senator KENNEDY's speech, she had been walking in passageway
behind stage of Embassy Room. She saw SIRHAN in the
passageway and told him to leave as area had to be kept
clear because of fire regulations. She watched SIRHAN
walk into the Embassy Room and did not see him again prior
to shooting. ROYER noticed nothing unusual about SIRHAN's

behavior and he appeared to be alone. Investigations

in neighborhoods where SIRHAN family has resided in
Pasadena, California, determined members of family

are quiet, reserved, and keep to themselves. Members

of SIRHAN family interviewed and all advised SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN had not been out of State of California
since 1957, and that during period 1957 to 6/4/68,

the longest period of time that SIRHAN had been away
from home was for periods of seven to ten days while
employed as exercise boy near Corona, California. Former
high school and college fellow students and instructors
of SIRHAN in Pasadena reported SIRHAN as intense student
who did not mingle much with other students. SANDRA
SERRANO, who had reported woman in white dress with black
polka dots running from Ambassador Hotel immediately
after shooting, claiming, "We've shot him. We've shot
him," interviewed by Los Angeles Police Department
6/20/68. SERRANO admitted previous story concerning
girl in white dress with black polka dots was figment

of her imagination. ‘

Mrs, DANA TULITA WESTLAKE, 349 Redwood Drive, Woodacre,
California, was contacted at the home of GEORGE CHARLES ERHARD,
1978 Olive Way, Pasadena, California. She was advised of the
identity of the interviewing agent and of the fact that she was
being contacted with regard to the handgun used in the assagsina-
tion of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

She advised that she had returned to the Los Angeles
area to visit with her family and friends and that she planned
on returning to Woodacre, California, on June 16, 1968. She
added that the ERHARDS' were former neighbors and that she had
resided at 1988 Olive Way prior to moving to Woodacre, California,
on February 12, 1968.

WESTLAKE advised that her father, ALBERT L. HERTZ,
had originally purchased a .22 caliber, eight shot, Iver-Johnson
revolver during the Watts riots (October, 1965). This revolver
was kept in the HERTZ home until about January, 1967 when her
mother, Mrs. SARA TAYLOR HERTZ, 777 East Valley Boulevard,
Apartment 32, Alhambra, California, gave the revolver to Mrs.
WESTLAKE. She added that her mother did not want the revolver
in the house and did not feel it was necessary to have it
laying around.

WESTLAKE advised that to her knowledge the revolver
had never been fired by her father or anyone else prior t9 this
time and that the revolver was still in a box and wrapped in a
black oily paper. Also contained in the box was a short rod
which she assumed was used to clean the revolver. In addition,
she received some ammunition for the revolver; however, she
"got rid" of the ammunition soon after she received the revolver
and she hid the revolver in the attic of their residence, which
was 1988 Olive Way, Pasadena, California, at that time. The
revolver was still in the original box it came in and she hid
it so that her children would not find it and maybe harm or kill
someone by accident.

In approximately September or October, 1967, her
husband started to remodel their home and it was necessary to
remove the roof from the house. At that time she removed the
contents from the attic and decided she would get rid of the
revolver. Since her neighbor's son, GEORGE CHARLES ERHARD, JR.,
collected guns and many other things, she decided to give him
the revolver. ERHARD, JR. agreed to take the revolver and she
gave it to him as it was,in the box and still wrapped in the oily
paper. She advised that neither she nor anyone else had fired
the revolver up until the time she gave it to ERHARD, JR. She
stated that no. one knew that she had the revolver except her
husband and her father and mother and that ERHARD, JR. did not
come to her to purchase a gun. She reiterated that she merely
gave him the revolver in order to prevent an accident in the
event her children found it.

WESTLAKE described the revolver as an eight shot,
Iver-Johnson revolver with a short barrel and a cylinder which
could be taken out to extract the cartridges. In addition, it
was a dark or blue steel weapon with a small hand grip. She
had no record of any serial numbers which could be used to
identify the revolver any further.

She advised that she was presently employed by PETER
EDWARDS, Manager of "The Reporter", a newspaper, and that she
was legal clerk. Their office is located at Fourth and A
Streets, Herzog Building, Fairfax, California.

"I, JESSE CARDONA, 620 Hurstview Avenue,
make the following voluntary statement to JOSEPH
G. DAVIS, JR. and JAMES E. ROSS, who have identi-
fied themselves to me as Special Agents of the FBI.

“On 6/4/65, I was regularly engaged in deliver-
ing mail out of the Duarte Post Office. Part of my
route takes me to the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club,
Duarte, when I usually take my dailey break I
arrived about 10:50 a m. and took the mail to LLOYD
HAGER, the range master We were standing there
talking and my neighbor, CHARLES MILLNER, and a
friend RUSSELL WEAVER came in They arrived at
approximately 10:55 a.m. I vreeted them, they paid
their fees, got their targets, and then we all walk-
ed to the pistol rance

"There was only one person on the pistol range at
that time He was on the far west end of the shoot-
ing line, down near wnere the small numbers begin.

He was not then shooting, so MILLNER and WEAVER put
up their targets, and returned to the firing line.
MILLNER and WEAVER were at the opposite end of the
pistol range, the east end.

"I did not talk to the person at the west end of
the pistol range. As best I can recall, he was a white
male, approximately aze 25 to 30 years old. He was
about 5 foot 3 inches tall, weiched about 150 pounds,
and had dark, possibly black hair. He wore ‘blue levis!
pants and had on a ‘pull over sveater type shirt with
Short sleeves He was a very mascular person. He

had on shooters type ‘ear muffs! I do not know what

"type of gun he was using but he did have what
appeared to me to be a telescope with which he
could Look through at a target.

"Based on my observations of this person, I
do not think that he is identical with the person
pictured in the photographs displayed to me by Special
Agent DAVIS. I did recognize the photographs as be-
ing the p om identified in the newspapers as SIRHAN
STRHAN. 2 cannot recall observing SIRHAW on the pistol
range while I was there or anyone resembling him.

"I left the range about 11:15 a.m. continuing
on my mail route. At the time I left, only my two
friends and the person at the west end of the pistol
range previously mentioned were then at the pistol
range. No other persons came during this time to the
pistol range.

"To the best of my recollection, there were no
female persons on the range, although there was sev-
eral other male persons on the rifle range, whom I
did not know.

I've read the above statement consisting of
this page and three others. It is true and correct,

Mr. THOMAS A, FARRELL, 1117 Sandia, La Puente,
California, was interviewed at his place of employment, 526
South San Pedro, Los Angeles, California.

Mr, FARRELL stated he drove to the San Gabriel
Valley Gun Club, Duarte, California, on June 4, 1968. He
arrived at 11:45 a.m. and left at about 3:20 p.m. He stated
that he fired on the pistol range from the time of his arrival
until about 2:00 p.m. when he moved to the rifle range, Upon
his arrival, he signed in at the Range Mester's Shack and
took @ position on the pistol range almost in front of the
Range Master's Office. To the best of his recollection two
men were on the line when he arrived, one was a 50 year old
man shooting from position No. 1 which was at the opposite
end of the pistol range from him and a young man about 25
years of 8ge shooting to his immediate right. Subsequently,
another man abous 25 years of age arrived and took a position
to his immediate left, He exchanged brief "gun talk” with
these individuals and described them both as approximately
5'11", medium build, medium to light complexion. Also
around 12:30 p.m., two men and two women arrived together
and fired from a position some distance to his left. He
described these individuals as a man and woman in their
early 60's, a young girl approximately 16 years of age,
whose description he could not recall, and a boy about 13
years of age wearing cowboy boots with extra-long light
brown hair, approximately 5'10" tall.

FARRELL said he saw no other females during his
entire stay at the range and did not recognize anyone there
except the range master who was working with enother man
and appeared to be digging post holes. When he went from
the pistol to the rifle range, there were approximately three
or four men shooting. .

FARRELL viewed a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN and
said to the best of his knowledge he had never seen the latter.

RICHARD THOMAS GRIJALVA, 9011 South Morrill, Santa
Fe Springs, California, was interviewed at his residence.
He was advised that the purpose of the interview was to obtain
any and all information known to him concerning the activities
which occurred at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte,
California, on June 4, 1968, on which day he had been at the
range. .

GRIJALVA advised he had gone to the range on
June 4, 1968, with his sister, ROBERTA GRIJALVA, age 19 years,
for the purpose of firing his rifle, stating that the reason
he had taken his sister was for her to assist him in “spotting”
his shots. He said that to the best of his recollection he
had arrived at the range and had signed in somewhere in the
vicinity of 10:15 a.m. and 10:25 a.m., stating that he could
recall a time rather specifically as he has formed a habit of
looking at his watch when arriving or leaving a particular
place. He said he recalled staying at the range until
approximately 2:45 p.m. at which time he returned home.

He said after signing in and obtaining a target,
he had immediately gone to the rifle deck where he began shoot-
ing, believed by him to be in approximately gun position number
34. He said there were several other people on the range
firing at this time and he recalled to his right, approximately
five or six positions from him, were two young men in their
early 20's. Also to his right and between his position and
that of the two young men was an older man and
woman, who had with them a young child, age about three
or four years. On his left he observed an elderly man
several# positions from him sighting in a rifle which he recalled
was a .22 caliber bolt action with scope. He said he
also recalled two men accompanied by a blond female around
the rifle deck, but said he could not recall whether these
individuals were firing or not. He said the blond would be
about 25 years of age, white, 5'7", blond hair worn in a ponytail,
light complexion, blue eyes, heavy set and wearing light colored
capris’ with the blouse out.

GRIJALVA stated the two man may have been brothers,
these men being approximately 23 to 25 years of age, who were
both to his recollection wearing T-shirts, levis: and generally
were very unkempt. He stated he also believed that the older
of the two men was wearing a beard which appeared to be red.

He stated while firing the rifle he could hear
firing from the pistol range and noted that the firing was
very rapid. He said he thought at this time it was very
strange, inasmuch as rapid fire shooting is generally not
allowed. He said he did not actually go to the pistol
range to observe who may have been firing the pistol, but
that on one occasion,when getting a new target at the target
shed near the pistol range, he observed a young male further
up the pistol range and assumed that this was the man who was
firing the gun. He said he hased this: assumption on the’
fact that he could not recall seeing any other individuals
on the pistol range at this time.

GRIJALVA stated after a considerable period of
time, the specific time not recalled since he paid little
attention to the actual time, he observed a young white male
coming from the direction of the pistol range carrying a pistol
and that this individual went to a car in the parking area
where he apparently left his pistol and picked up a rifle.
He said this individual then came to the rifle deck at
about position number 30 and commenced firing the rifle which
he described as a .22 bolt action. He described this individual
as white, male, 24 to 27 years of age, dark complected, 130
pounds, hair combed back very neat and who was wearing a blue
sweater, blue pants and possibly blue denim shoes. He said
the man also wore sunglasses and it was very obvious to him
that the man was a stranger, inasmuch as he kept to himself
and did not desire to talk to anyone. He said this was quite
strange, inasmuch as most shooters will discuss their shooting
with each other during the course of the day.

Mr. GRIJALVA was exhibited a photograph of SIRHAN
SIRHAN; and after viewing this, stated that this individual
closely resembles the man he had seen coming from the pistol
deck and then who had then commenced firing a .22 rifle. He
said he could not be certain of this identification, inasmuch
as the man wore sunglasses but said that the shape of the face
and the general build closely resembled this man.

ROBERTA GRIJALIVA, 9O1LL South Morrill, Santa Fe
Springs, California, was interviewed at her residence. She
was advised that the purpose of the interview was to obtain
any and all information known to her concerning the activities
which occurred at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte,
California, on June 4, 1968, on which dayshe had been at the
range.

GRIJALVA stated she is 19 years of age and had
accompanied her brother, RICHARD GRIJALVA, to the San Gabriel
Valley Gun Club on June 4, 1968, stating that the main purpose
in her going was to "sight in" her father's rifle. She
said her brother had also asked her prior to going to the
range if she would assist him in "spotting" his target for
him.

She stated she could not recall specifically as to
what time they had arrived at the range but stated that to the
best of her recollection it was in the late morning, probably
in the neighborhood of 11:00 a.m. but said she could recall
specifically abdut the time they had left the range, this being
at 2:45 p.m. due to the fact that she had to be at work at
4:30 p.m. in the afternoon. She said that they had arrived
home from the range at 3:30 p.m. on this date.

GRIJALVA said when they arrived at the range they
had walked from the car to the rifle deck to a position
approximately 100 feet from the target shed where her brother
subsequently fired the rifle. She said her brother had gone
to the target shed for the purpose of signing in and obtaining
a target but that she had gone directly to the deck. She
said when approaching the rifle deck, she observed in the same
area two men and a woman, who had apparently finished firing
a rifle and who were then in the process of leaving the range.
She said she observed that the rifle they had apparently been
firing had been left at the gun position and that the three
had walked in the direction of the parking area. She said

right after this she observed the older man and woman, who
had been conversing with each other, walk in the direction
of the pistol range and she then lost sight of them. She
said the younger man did not goto the pistol range but had
stayed near the car and subsequently, in about 50 minutes,
had walked back to the rifle position, had picked up the gun
and had returned to the area where the car had been parked.
She said at the time he returned to the car with the rifle
the man and woman were observed, by her, to be returning to
the car after which time they all got into the car with the
man driving, the woman in the front seat and the younger
man in the rear seat and departed.

She described the automobile being driven by
these people as a late model Lincoln Continental, possibly a
1966 or 1967 model, which sf believed was a dark brown in
color. She said that she was quite certain as to the make
of the car, inasmuch as her next door neighbor has a car just
like this.

She stated as before that the girl and the older
man conversed with each other at all times but that she could
not hear any of the conversation and that she had gained
the impression that they were not man and wife but had merely
gone to the range together.

She said she did not know whether the girl had
actually fired the gun or not.

With respect to any firing on the pistol range,

she said that while her brother was firing his rifle she heard
a great deal of firing from the pistol area and noted that

~15-

the firing was all very rapid. She said she did not go to
the pistol range to see who was firing the gun, but on one
occasion while at the target shed she observed one man on the
pistol range dressed in blue clothes, who she assumed to be the
man firing the pistol.

GRIJALVA said she later observed this man, who,
she said was wearing a blue sweater, blue slacks and sunglasses
come from the direction of the pistol range at which time
he obtained a rifle from some place which she had not
observed and he then commenced firing a rifle. She said
he fired this rifle on four or five positions from which she
and her brother were located, that he did not fire for any
great period of time. She said while still at the rifle
range, and while her brother was firing, this man quit the
rifle shooting and apparently left the range as she did not see
him again. ;

GRIJALVA was exhibited a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN
at which time she stated that she believed that this individual
was identical to the individual described above who she
had observed wearing blue clothes coming from the pistol
deck to the rifle deck. She said she could not be certain
in her identification; however, inasmuch as the individual
she had seen wore large sunglasses, which she thought strange
inasmuch as she did not believe the best shooting could be
had while wearing sunglasses. She stated the face of this
individual was of the same shape as that of SIRHAN SIRHAN
and that she recalled that this individual appeared to be foreign.

She stated she could recall no further details
of this particular date but felt quite certain that she would
be able to recognize the female described above should she
see her again and was quite definite that she could recognize
the younger man,whom she believed to be the "hippie" of the
group.

She stated should she recall anything specific
on this date she would immediately contact the FBI.

possibly June 8, 1968. He stated he could provide no description
on the man or woman. He stated that he recalled seeing several

attempt on Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY and hearing the description
of the suspect in custody by Local police, he immediately
thought of the individual whom he had seen at the firing range
on June 4, 1968. After seeing SIRHAN SIRHAN's picture on

he had seen.

Upon being shown photographs of various individuals
including SIRHAN SIRHAN, KENDALL picked out the photograph of

San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte, California.

Mr. LEOS advised that he is a regular shooter

at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club on Tuesdays and that on

Range. Mr. LEOS said that he recalls on June 4, 1968,
having arrived at the San Gabriel Valley Gun club at
approximately 9:30 A.M., when he took position No. 26 or

27 on the pistol range. He said that that day he fired
his .22 Browning Metalistic Automatic long rifle and his

LEOS said that,shortly after these three indivi-
quals arrived on the range and began to fire, Man No. 1
came to him, LEOS, and asked him for a screwdriver to
adjust the sight of his weapon. LEOS said that he paid
no particular attention to this and did not actually see

mated it to be a .38 pistol. As best as he could remember,
LEOS said that he thought all three of these individuals
fired the same gun. LEOS said that all three of these
individuals left the range before he did and would estimate
that they left approximately 10:45 to ll:o00 A.M., this date.

to target number 57 or number 58, as best he could remember,
which he explained was located approximately the middle of the
rifle range. Mr. SEM stated he remained on the rifle range for
approximately one and one-half hours. During this time there
were approximately ten to twelve other individuals using the
rifle range. He was not acquainted with any of these individuals
nor did he converse with any of them except an older man,

California, was interviewed at his residence. He is self
employed as a subcontractor doing lettering for commercial
signs.

Mr. STIPP advised he went to the San Gabriel Valley
Gun Club the morning of June 44, 1968 to speak with Mr. HAGER,
the range maflager, regarding some sign work he was to do for
the club and also to practice shooting his rifle. He arrived
at the club around $:00 a.m. He spent approximately one-half
hour talking with Mr, HAGER and another individual by the name
of CHARLIE JENKINS, who was doing some conerete work at the club.
Mr. JENKINS is a member of Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) at
Monrovia, California. Mr. STIPP stated he registered at the
target house listing his name and address. He explained he was
not required to register but he normally does so as he is then
placed on a mailing list to receive brochures regarding hunting
Seasons, ete. Mr. STIPP stationed himself in approximately
the middle of the rifle range and as best he could recall, it
was target number 52. He was shooting a 300 Holland and Holland
Winchester Model 70 rifle. Mr. STIPP is a National Rifle
Association (NRA) member, membership number 15R917S30STIPM9561,
expiration date October, 1970. Mr. STIPP advised that when he
arrived at the rifle range, there were four other males on the
range; two to the right of him and two to the left. After be-
ing on the range about one hour, a young man arrived and station-
ed himself next to him, Mr. STIPP. This individual in his mid
30's, was alone. He was shooting a Japanese rifle. At one
point this individual had trouble with his rifle and he, Mr.
STIPP, helped him adjust the sights. Mr. STIPP advised he noti-
ced two young fellows, probably in theizx middle 20's, stationed
approximately eight to ten places to his right and each were
shooting a 03A3 30:06 Military rifle. He advised he did not pay
any attention to the other individuals at the range nor the rifle
being used. He also mentioned he did recall seeing a young girl,
approximately 14 to 21 years of age on the rifle range. He
specifically remembered seeing her in the company of an older
man and assumed this was her father.

Mr. STIPP did not recall seeing a blonde female at the

gun club during the time he was there. He did not observe any
of those people shooting on the pistol range as he has no
occasion to visit the pistol range and he explained one cannot
observe the pistol range from the rifle range or from the target
house as there is a concrete wall separating the pistol range
from the other areas of the range. Mr. STEIPP observed a photo-
Zs f STRHAN SIRHAN, Los Angeles Police Department number
a. He did not observe this individual at the club while
é was there. Mr. STIPP left the gun club at approximately

at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, 4001 Fish Canyon Road,
Duarte, California, at approximately 10:30 to 11:00 a.m, for
the purpose of target shooting. THORNBRUGH stated that he had
just recently obtained a .22 caliber clip loaded Ruger automatic
pistol and he wanted to practice with it. After paying
the admission fee and securing his target, THORNBRUGH stated
that he took his place at a firing position closest to the
range house. THORNBRUGH stated that he thought this would be
approximately gun position 22 or 23. He stated he saw an
individual, who he described as approximately five feet
six or seven inches in height, 135 to 140 pounds, dark curly
hair, dark complexion, firing at a gun posit:on to his left
in an area, which he estimated to be around gun position
12 or 13.

At this time, THORNBRUGH was shown a number of
photographs, including a photograph of SIRHAN HARA STRHAN,
Los Angeles Police Department Booking Number P| and
THORNBRUGH positively identified the photograph of SIRHAN as
being the individual whom he saw at the range.

THORNBRUGH further stated that the individual whom
he identified as SIRHAN was at the range when he, THORNBRUGH,

range personnel patroling the firing area and did not recall
seeing any woman on the range except for one girl, whom he
could describe only as Mexican appearing and possibly in her
tventies. He stated he did not recall seeing this girl in the
area of SIRHAN, nor did he observe any conversations between
them.

THORNBRUGH stated that one thing that sticks in
his mind concerning SIRHAN was the fact that he was shooting
more rapidly than others on the range and the fact that he was
shooting from a rather unusual crouching position.

THORNBRUGH stated that he saw only one individual
at the range whom he knew personally and that individual was
MIKE HOLGATE, whom he said was presently a student at Citrus
Junio& College in Glendora, California.

to JOSEPH G. DAVIS, JR. and JAMES E. ROSS, who

"On 6/4/63, I accompanied a friend CHARLES
MILLNER, 626 Hurstview Avenue to the San Gabriel
Valley Gun Club, Duarte, arriving there at appro-
ximately 11 AM On arrival, we went to the range
master to check in and to get targets. We then went
to the pistol range portion, which basically runs
east and west. We took a position on the right hand
side of the pistol range, that is, the last target
position to the east side of the pistol range.

There was one other person on the pistol range
ac that time. He was at the target position to the far
left of the pistol range, that is, about the last or
next to last target position to the west side of the
pistol range.

"type ‘ear muffs', appearing to be of some type blue
cloth with fur on it, of a commercial nature. It
was my impression only, that he might be a police
officer, because he was orderly in handling his gun
and amunition and he appeared to be an experienced
shooter. This person had two guns. One was a 4
magnum automatic, the gun he was then shooting and
holding in his right hand. The other gun was a
smaller automatic, blue in color, and which may
have been a .22 caliber. This sitaller gun was
lying in a black 'satchel' type of case, one side
of which folded down opening up the 'satchel'. He
also had a small telescope which was mounted on a
tripod resting on the bench. The scope was about a
foot long and on the tripod, it stood about a foot
tall.

"Approximately 10 minutes or so af'ter our arrival,
I went over to this person and asked tnat he cease
shooting in order that we could go down and check our
targets. It was at this time that I observed the
small gun in his 'satchel' and’ the other details
listed above. On one other occasion during the
hour that we were there, I asked this pergon if he
would again cease firing in order that we could
check our targets.

"Based on my observations of this person, I
can definitely say that he is not identical with the
person pictured in the photographs displayed to my by
Special Agent DAVIS. I did recognize the photographs
as being the person identified in the newspapers as
SIRHAN SIRHAN. I did not observe SIRHAN on the pistol
range while I was there or anyone resembling hin.

arrived on the pistol range. They hoth spoke to the per-
