‘Res Mr. Sirhan Sirhan

Gentlemens

Mr. Sirhan came to this office on February 21, 1967, having been
referred to me by Dre Milton A. Miller of Ontario. fhe history of the
case as I received it from the patient is briefly as follows:

The patient exercised the horses at thé Granja Vista Del Rio ranch
in Corona. On September 24, 1966, he was thrown from his horse and suffered
injuries around the left eye, He thinks he was unconscious for a brief
time. He was seen at the Corona hospital by a Dr. Richard Nelson and the
wounds around the eye were sutured. In addition to the wound around the
eve he had a wound under the chin. [his was also sutured. Four days
later the sutures were removed. He suffered a brief injury again a fiw ~
days after the initial injury and the wound edges separated a little bit.
He was unaware of any eye problems until he began exercising the horses
again, He noticed at this time that he had to move his head from left to
right in order.to sec ‘wetl on either sidc. ‘This loss of side vision has :
definitely improved but he still has some difficulty. This is especially
noticeable in the left cye. Because of his eve complaincs Ay vas referred

rae

to a Dr. Nelson of Corena and following Thi .. oe. Jibs “Se Ji:ller of
Ontario. J do not have Or. .iller*'s reports so IT am unaware of exactly

whar Li. “i -.ings were. At the present time iit. Sirhan? s complaints
primarily are as follows: Lo

He notices that he has some twitching of the eyelid when he looks
“o the left. This. involves the left eyelid primarily. He also has the
same type of twitching when he wrinkies his forehead or makes facial
movements. He has had no suvsequent unconscious attacks, no dizziness,
no weakness of cither arms, hands, legs or feet, He complains of a
persistent pain in the superior nasal aspect of the left orbit, My
examination was as follows:

His vision was found to be 20/20 in either eye uncorrected. e had no
significant refractive error. tExtraocular muscles were found to be intact,

the pupils were round, were regular, and reacted well to light and
-accomodation. fhe paticnt's eyes wore dilated and an examination of ~The
‘fundus was performed. No significant abnormalities were found. .
Examination was performed both with the dfrect and indirect ophthal-
moscopc. Slit lamp examination showed no flare or cells in either eve.
Both lenses are clear and the media appeared clear. Visual field
examination indicates a full fleid with a moderate amount of general
constriction in the left field. [his constriction is incons*:
patient's wounds are well healed, however there is a persistent
over’ the supertor orbital ridge medially and there is a small amounr of
fullness in this area remaining. The tenderness is medial to the supra-
orbital notch and is apparently aggravated when the patient looks ‘both to”
the left and upward to the left. [here.is a fibrotic hand extending - from
this general area downward to the area just below the lower canthal
_ ligament. He clainis that this makes him have a ‘rather tight sensation
| when he looks to the left. I could demonstrate no abnormal ciplopia,
in fact my findings are remarkably negative with the exception af: the
tenderness and the subcutaneous band which 1 ientioned. At the present
time, I do not feel Like operating on the area which is described, and
releasing this band. 1 feel that we should wait for a period of about
one month yet. At the time of releasing this subcutaneous band I! believe
it would be advisable to investigate the original wound area for the
possibility of a foreign body reaction giving fiim the persistent pain
which he feels and is described above. X-Rays ordered by me have indicated
no evidence of a foreign body, no evidence of any fractures in and about
the orbit, and said X-Rays are essentially negative, The X-Rays were taken
by Dr. Robert Freeman, of this address, I shalj see Mr. Sirhan again
and repeat visual field tests to make sure that there is no recurrent
abnormality. Inasmuch as he was unconscious and had not been seen by a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon I believe it would be advisable to have
him seen by @ neurosurgeon to rule out any damage to:the brain that might
have oceured at the time of this injury. ‘I have usually referred wy
patients to a Dre Robert Fiskin, of 960 E. Green Ste, Pasadena. Ye is a
_wellequalified neurosurgeon and if you have no objection T would
respectfully request your referral of Mre Sirhan to Dr. Fiskin For such an |
evaluation.

I trust this will give. you an up-roedateé accounting of Nr. Sithan' s
problems, y,

Sincerely,
