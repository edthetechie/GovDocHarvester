primarily the Embassy Room and the Colonial Room.
About midnight on June 4, 1968, I was standing
between the pantry and the kitchen when I observed
Senator Robert F, Kennedy, accompanied by his
wife and a number of other people walk through
the kitchen area and go into the Embassy Room
where Senator Kennedy gave a speech.

"Apout twenty to twenty-five minutes after
entering the Embassy Room, Senator Kennedy came
back out of the Embassy Room into the pantry

area. I was standing between the pantry and the
kitchen, about ten to fifteen feet from Senator
Kennedy when I heard several loud noises which
sounded like shots. At that time Senator Kennedy
was shaking hands with the two cooks and I saw
him double up and fall backwards to the floor,

A large crowd of people immediately gathered
around him and then I saw three or four men
wrestling with a man who had a gun in his right
hand. The man with the gun was standing about
eight or ten feet from Senator Kennedy and was

a young man about twenty or twenty five years

of age. He was wearing a blue sports coat. I
just got a glimpse of the side of the man's

face and could not identify him from that quick
glance other than to say he was a young man. I
also noticed the man had a lot of black hair
which appeared uncombed. The only man I recognized
who was wrestling with the man was Carl Yucker,
the banquet captain, I recall seeing the same
man about twenty minutes prior to that time as
he was walking into the Colonial Room. The man
was alone and I only saw him from the rear, but
I recognized him because of the same blue sport
coat.

"The men who were wrestling the man with the
gun were near the steam tables and they finally
got the man on the steam table and held him
down. My attention was then directed again to
Senator Kennedy who was lying on the floor. I
saw blood on his stomach and on the right side
of his head, Then the crowa of people moved in
around Senator Kennedy and I didn't see him any-
more, I then returned to the kitchen area and
did not see either Senator Kennedy or the man
with the gun again.

"T have seen a photograph of Sirhan Sirhan
and I do not know him, Further, I can not
positively say he was the same man I observed
with the gun the night Senator Kennedy was
shot. I do not recall ever seeing anyone
resembling Sirhan Sirhan in or around the hotel

"Shortly before twelve otclock midnight on
June 4, 1968, I was sitting in the kitchen employees'
dining room adjacent to the Embassy Room Service
Pantry. I was sitting with Jesus Perez, hotel
employee, and a hotel security guard whose name I
do not recall. As we sat at the table, I saw Senator
Robert F. Kennedy and other persons walk through
the dining room and proceed to the Embassy Room.

"TI remained at the dining table figuring my work
schedule when at about 12:15 a.m., June 5, 1968,
I heard what sounded like three firecracker explosions.
About two seconds later, I heard a burst of about six
more firecracker explosions. As best I can recall,
there was about one second delay between the first and
second explosion_, and about the same length of time
petween the second explosion and series of about six
pursts. I looked up to see what made these noises and
saw small lines of smoke coming from the Embassy Room
Service Pantry.

"Immediately I arose from the table, ran into the
pantry, and stood next to a metal tray stand across from .
a row of chrome steam tables. I saw two white male
Caucasians wearing Kennedy campaign sportcoats and top
hats standing on each side of a slender built male who
appeared to be of Cuban descent standing against the
steam tables. This person waved a pistol with his
right hand, thus I yelled out to the effect, let's
get him. The two men in the Kennedy campaign clothes
grabbed the person waving the pistol before I did,
and in the confusion, someone jumped ahead of me before
I could reach him. However, I was able to observe his
face and the pistol he held in his hand.

"By this time, several persons had shoved the

above person against the steam tables, and had him
sprawled over the table; but he was still waving

the pistol. I ran around to the other side of the
steam tables in attempt to get the gun but too many
people blocked my path. As I turned, I observed
Senator Robert F. Kennedy lying on the floor of the
Embassy Room Service Pantry. I ran to the Room Service
desk to call for an ambulance; however, the phone was
being used. I then ran to the Room Clerk's Office

in the main lobby, but his telephone was also in use.
Unable to locate an unused telephone, I ran back to the
Embassy Room Service Pantry.

"Senator Kennedy was still lying on the floor;
however, the person waving the gun had been moved down
to the east end of the Service Pantry and was being
held against the steam tables. I walked down toward
where the individual was being held and saw Karl Eucher,
Maitre D'Hotel, and Eddie, last name unknown, Assistant
Maitre D', along with a tall heavy Negro in a maroon
sportcoat, holding this individual against the steam
tables.

"Eddie asked me to go get some rope in order that
they could tie this individual up. I turned to go find
some rope, however, I saw some Los Angeles Police
Department officers enter the pantry. From that point,
I assisted the police department and ambulance crews
load the wounded indivudals (total of four including
Senator Kennedy), onto the service elevator and out
of the hotel.

"I did not cbserve the police officers take the
above individual who waved the pistol from the Embassy
Room Service Pantry; however, as stated, I did observe
him when I ran into the Pantry after hearing the above
described explosions. The following is a physical
description of that person:
