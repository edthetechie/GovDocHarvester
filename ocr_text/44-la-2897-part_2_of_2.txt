INFORMATION CONCERNING

On 5/29/75 WALT suf TH, Dean of Student Affairs,
Glendale College, Glendale, Malifornia, telephonically advised
e-studentsof Gléndale College made arrangements to
have THOMSON appear on campus on 6/3/75 at 11:00 A.M. in
their campus center building to discuss the JOHN F. KENNEDY
assassination.

Dean SMITH advised that he has utilized his offices
to keep THOMSON off the campus for the past year. However,
because of the student desires, THOMSON has been allowed to
appear on campus to discuss President KENNEDY's assassination
for one hour.

Mr. SMITH advised the reason he is bringing this to
our attention is that THOMSON wrote him a letter stating that
he should contact WILLIAM A. SULLIVAN at the FBI office
and invite him to attend.

I told Dean SMITH that Mr. SULLIVAN has no interest
in hearing THOMSON speak and would not be in attendance at
this function. Dean SMITH stated he understood, but inasmuch
as THOMSON wrote to him asking him to contact Mr. SULLIVAN,
he did so.

Mr. Ted Gunderson
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Los Angeles, CA

Subject: PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO OVERTHROW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
FBI INTERVIEW OF NOVEMBER 18, 1977 WITH
SPECIAL AGENT JOHN KELLER

Dear Sir:

Please consider this letter a formal complaint against Special Agent

John Keller of your organization and against an agent unidentified who
refused to allow me to bring vital national defense information and evi-
dence to your personal attention when such a request was made by telephone
on November 17, 1977.

At approximately 2:00 p.m. on November 18, 1977, an interview was conducted
in your offices with the following persons in attendance:

Mr. George C. Thomson

Mrs. George C. Thomson

Miss Patricia Donnelly .

Mr. Marc Blalack

The interview was initiated by myself when, upon reading a U.S. Government
publication revealing certain conversations in the White House between
President Nixon and some of his assistants, reference was made to a man
named William C, Sullivan, Mr. Sullivan was recently killed in an accident,
the full details of which have not been revealed in the press. Mr. Sullivan
was the head of FBI intelligence just prior to the time these conversations

took place.

The tone and substance of these conversations indicated that President
Nixon and his closest aides feared for Mr. Sullivan's safety. It was
for this reason that I requested the interview since it was apparent to
me that, since a high ranking FBI official had recently died a violent
death; and that his knowledge of the details of Dallas, Los Angeles, and
Chappaquidick were of such extreme importance, a possible conspiracy to

murder him should be investigated.
I had at hand for the interview evidence of the following nature:

1. Two photographs which conclusively prove that President Kennedy
was not present in the murder car at Dallas and was therefore not shot.

2. Conclusive proof founded on the results of the autopsy, grand jury
testimony, eye witnesses’ statements, and photographs which prove that
also Senator Robert Kennedy was not shot in Los Angeles.

3. A logical presentation which would lend credence to the supposition
that Senator Robert Kennedy subsequently died by drowning at Chappaquidick
Island in 1969,

This evidence and evidence Miss Patricia Donnelly attempted to introduce
was refused by Special Agent Keller, and the meeting abruptly terminated.

For the above reasons, I am requesting that I be allowed to present this
information to you personally, since it is my conviction that a proper
evaluation of its contents would be valuable both to the FBL.and the
people of this beautiful country.
Very truly ow
org¢g/C. Thomson

GEORGE C. THOMSON
_ INFORMATION CONCERNING

DIRECTOR, FBI

ReButelcall of Inspector THOMAS J. STAnOERE, FBI
Headquarters, to Los Angeles 5/16/78.

During reteéleall Inspector BIAMONTE advised that. the
Bureau recently received a letter from captioned individual , :
which had been directed to the Department of Justice which’ e
was dated 1/11/78. According to Inspector BIAMONTE, instant
letter contained critical comments regarding Supervisor JOHN
HALL. ' s . . i

A search of the files at Los Angéles failed to locate
a letter: from THOMSON dated 1/11/78. There are, however,
numerous other letters received from THOMSON over the years,
the latest of which is dated 11/21/77, in which THOMSON. is
eritical of a complaint agent for not permitting him to fully
present information in THOMSON's possession concerning the —
‘assassination of former President KENNEDY and former Senator
KENNEDY. ‘THOMSON stated in his letter that he has information

_ which will conclusively prove that President KENNEDY was not
present in the murder car at Dallas and was therefore not
shot. He also claims to have information including photographs

-. which prove that Senator ROBERT KENNEDY was not shot in Los

. enqeiee but rather died by drowbing - at Chappaquiddick Island

n 1969.

THOMSON‘ s letter of 11/21/77 was ‘orally acknowledged

-by Supervisor HALL. During that conversation Mr. THOMSON

was told that all of the information previously furnished by

him to the Los Angeles Office of the FBI had been forwarded to

PBI Headquarters and made availablé to the U. 8. Department of |
. Justice. He was advised that unless he had. new information to

present, it was not necessary for him to re-present “his s alseoee

evidence.

The Bureau should note that THOMSON was the subject |
of a Bureau airtel to all SACs dated 12/15/64 wherein THOMSON's
work was noted to be fallacious and of no value.
