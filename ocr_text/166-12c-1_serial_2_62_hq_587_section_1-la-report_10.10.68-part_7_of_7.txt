about being a member of a minority race and perhaps he, the
Negro, should join forces with JIBRIL, a Jordanian, yet no
specific objective was stated.

The other individual approached was Dr. KLAUS
KUETTINER, currently employed at St. Luke Presbyterian Hospital,
Chicago. According to information received from KUETTNER, JIBRIL
approached him and discussed the fact that the Germans, of which
ancestry KUETTNER is a part, had a "hatred" for Jewish people
and they, Dr. KUETTNER and JIBRIL, should join forces, again
no specific purpose named. :

LINDENBAUM pointed out it is his opinion JIBRIL,
as a member of the Jordanian people, even though born in
Palestine, which is now Israel, has such a deep emotional
seating of his hatred of Jewish individuals, he is not able
to adjust to life in the United States. LINDENBAUM advised
he felt this was in all probability taught to JIBRIL as a
youngster and this is the only line of thinking he knows.

LINDENBAUM again advised JIBRIL did not make any
statements about political leaders, or figures, nor did he
ever make any statements concerning any assassinations. He
did note, however, JIBRIL did talk once about being involved
in the murder or murders of British soldiers who were in
Jordan when he, JIBRIL, was about fifteen or sixteen years
of age.

and one of his superiors there at the time was ARTHUR LINDENBAUM.
He said that LINDENBAUM was of Jewish extraction and was

aware of the fact that he, JIBRIL, was of Arab extraction.

He said that LINDENBAUM was further aware of the fact that he,
JIBRIL, had been born and lived at least part of his life

in Israel-occupied Palestine. He related that LINDENBAUM
constantly "needled" him regarding Arab - Israeli relations,
particularly in regard to the formation of the State of

Israel in 1948 from former Arab territory. JIBRIL noted that
he has a "low boiling point" over the Arab -~ Israeli political
situation and LINDENBAUM, in his opinion, was obviously

aware of this. He at first denied ever having made the state-
ment to LINDENBAUM or anyone else that he was a member of a
secret organization whose purpose was to assassinate political
leaders and others in power in this country. Upon reflection,
however, he stated that in the heat of argument with LINDENBAUM
he may nave in fact made such statement, however, if he did,
it was merely an emotional outburst on his part, and had no
basis in fact. He added that as far as he knows there is
absolutely no Arab terrorist group operating in the United
States, however, he does know that such groups do operate in
Israel and in other areas of Palestine now occupied by the
State of Israel.

He further commented that he does not personally
know and never heard of SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN, the alleged
assassinator of Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY.

He stated that he considers himself a loyal American
citizen and in this regard commented, "I love this country’.
He also related that he is Vice President of the Arab - American
Congress for Palestine, which has no official address other
than a post office box in Chicago, Illinois, the identity of
which he does not know. He said the purpose of the Arab -
American Congress for Palestine is to aid Arab refugees who have

been forcibly removed from their homes by the formation of
the State of Israel in 1948, as well as the former Arab lands
which have been conquered by the State of Israel, According
to JIBRIL, this aid consistssof food and other necessities of
life, such as clothing and medicine, but does not include
firearms or other things of this nature.
