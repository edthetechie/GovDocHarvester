WALTER advised that he walked into the kitchen area before
KENNEDY came through the hallway, but took no notice of
any particular individual.

While waiting for KENNEDY to finisn his speech,
‘IALTER and TIMOTHY assisted an individual in forming a
line t> keep people from entering the hallway from the
Embassy Room.

Shortly thereafter, WALTER observed KENNEDY
leave tne stage area and enter the passageway into the
Kitchen.

At about that time, TIMOTHY and WALTER became
separated. WALTER attempted to follow KENNEDY into the
kitchen area and as he was entering tne kitchen area, he heard
three snarp noises which resembled a cap pistol.

At almost the same instant the crowd in front
of him opened leaving a greater gap between him and Senator
KENNEDY. WALTER saw a man fall backwards to the floor with
blood "all over his face and seemingly suspended in the air".
WALTER also saw Senator KENNEDY jying on the floor.

The crowd closed up the gap and immediately
pandemonium broke out.

WALTER and TIMOTHY immediately left the kitchen
area and hid behind a wall. WALTER’ advised .that he did not
near any shots after tne initial three shots were fired,
put ne observed at least two other individuals, both men,
inside the anteroom to the kitchen who nad apparently been
shot.

After remaining outside the kitchen for about a
minute, TIMOTHY was ‘able to re-enter the kitchen; however,
WALTER remained outside. WALTER stated he observed no further
activities inside the kitchen and did not, at any time, see
the individual resembling a photograph he had seen of SIRHAN
STIRHAN.

from the chair and ran towards the stage where KENNEDY had been
speaking. She then went left of the podium into a hall like

area in an attempt to reach KENNEDY, but when she was approximately
ten feet from KENNEDY thearea was dosed off by someone shutting

a folding wooden partition. She then attempted to peer around the
partition and at that point the partition was drawn back by a
large Negro male who pushed HOWARD and herself to one side.

stand and noticed for the first time a white female, approximately
40 to 45 years old, lying on the right side of the speaker's
stand. She was covered up to her midriff with a table cloth

and her face and hair was covered with blood.

bullets", over and over again, as well as, "They shot him, they
shot him." MC MAHON observed that CASDEN had blood on her
head and the right side of her dress and leg. MC MAHON advised

that bullets went in front of her face and that Senator KENNEDY
had falien on her. She also told MC MAHON she had been behind
the Senator in the kitchen when he turned to the right, smiled,
shook her hand, took two steps forward, and then fell back upon
her. She told MC MAHON she then went along the kitchen wall and
ran back into the press room. MC MAHON advised that after this,
CASDEN appeared to become more incoherent and again repeated,
"Bullets, bullets”, over and over again. At this point MC MAHON
stated that a Secret Service Agent and herself started taking
CASDEN from the room heading for the right exit. MC MAHON
advised that she then observed approximately 15 Los Angeles
Policemen holding a man, however, she could not really see him,
but there was a large number of individuals apparently trying
to reach him. MC MAHON stated she then told the Secret Service
Agent she was going to take CASDEN home and they left the
puilding at that point.
