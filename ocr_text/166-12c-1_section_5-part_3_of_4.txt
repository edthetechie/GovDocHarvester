ARE BEING SENT TO - THE STATE DEPARTMENT
SENRTOR AIKEN _
SENATOR PROUTY

In the first place I widh to go on record as being a comphetely sane
person and a staunch Republican. I have held a job in New York for some

years before retiring that paid me well in five figures, which is not
paid in New York unless one is competent.

I wish toprotest the circus which is being held for the man who shot
Robert Kennedy, It is a circus and a complete waste of the taxpayers
money. How guilty do you have to be to be condemned? I would not
serve on a jnury for this man if my life depended on it. Hé is guilty
and should either pe put to death or out of the country. Out justice

department is ridiculous, Warren should be impeached and several of the
other justices are senile.

If Commander Boucher is court martialed I think we should all hang our
heads in shame. This man got no support from the Navy and put in a year
of mental anguish with his crew in Korea. I only wish the stupid
Admirals who are judging him could be put through the same thing. I
will see to it, and don't under estimate my abiligy, that you will get

a flood of protest if this thing is done. It is outrageous to put
this man through what you are doing to him.

We are aboug to start a new Administration and I trust Richard Nixon

will not be hangstring by a LOT OF stupid people. I think the man
is sincere and means well.” Let not play power politics, but play it
straight and fair, ;

P.S. To Senators Aiken & Prouty

Our method of selecting a jury in Vermont is outmoded. It should
be selected from a radius of 10 miles and not forty to fifty miles
and ask women of 65 to 80 to drive the mountain roads in winter’?

The Honorable Richard Millhouse Nixon
The White House
Washington 25, D.C.

My dear Mr. President: Wis wv

I am a senior now attending Warren Woods High School in
Warren. I was recently reading the daily newspaper when

I came across a piece about Sirhan Bishara Sirhan the

Pa Sa nc ine a aN

— paar ar rd eee nen Ra ale RE

assassinator of the late Robert Kennedy. _ This piece

teen pei tithe ate stn PERRO MCE EGRET EOE ma DOT tea Pewee Fm

aroused me to write you: this letter

I just cannot under-
carted done Eal afar

stand how a Person who kills a man with forty some odd people

neat fe ee eee ro vations te ete ate

“standing in the same room and. “another large number of people

watching on television still be going to court. I do
understand that his lawyer has said he is guilty but now

they are trying to decide whether or not he should be tried
on first or second degree murder, If a person kills another
he should not be tried for second degree murder and given
fifty years and then be let out in ten years on good behavior
to kill another he should be given the death sentence then
you will be sure he won't kill another.

About six months ago a person was let out of Jackson State
Prison after serving about five years out of a life imprisonment
came to Detroit and murdered a police officer, This I do not

think is rieht. Why shoulda @ man be able to kill a person —


--- Page 15 ---

go to prison get out and kill again. Some people say our
society is sick. I don't believe our society is sick it is
our court system that is sick, I think they should all be

reviewed and all of our judges be reviewed,

Mr. Nixon don't get me wrong I am very proud to be an American
I am proud of being free to make my own choices , to live
the way I want to, to @at and sleep’ where I want to not like
other people who are governmental puppets, to do what the
government wants them to do,

Mr. Nixon I would like to wish you the best of luck in the

next four years and the best of health to you.

"Some men see things as they are,
and say why

"I dream things that never were,
and say why not"

Very truly yours, !)

ATTENTION: Pres. Richard Nixon

My dear Mr. President:

For the past uecade I find myself asking, "Is this Russia or is this
the United States?" merely because I can't see justice being carried out
in these United States. Instead, justice is..."what's in it for me".
that's the way it appears to me.

It all started, I believe, to the riots and demonstrations (which was
supposed to be because of racialism) to the death of Pres. John F. Kennedy
by a man who loved Russia. This man did not shoot J. F. Kennedy because of
racialism or because J. F. Kennedy was for the poor class of people...be-
cause this man was from a poor class of people...so it don't make sense why
this guy shot J. F. Kennedy. What did Russia give or offer this man for his
love for Russia? If the American people Were asked, "Do you believe Oswald
shot Kennedy just because he was rich and Oswald poor’", I believe you will
not find the American people so gullible--.many assume there's more behind
it and I am one who is disappointed i in the United States Government for not

ee ——$——

finding out because we lost another good American leader, Robert TF. Kennedy,

who died the same way as his brother J.F.K by another guy who claims his
love for Russia. Robert F. Kennedy was not even president...and this Surhan
had no reason to shoot him. How can this Surhan afford the best eriminal
lawyer when he just worked at the race track? What did Russia ever offer

or give Surhan for he too claimed his love for Russia? Will Surhan be let

free to roam the United States when he hates it here...and those that love

the United States their lives are being taken away? "What's going on in —.5

Ip - fPE] -
HD} i ee
Another incident is these guys like Dr. Spoke and br. \Coffain who has

5: FEB 14 1969

these United States?" I keep asking myself.



--- Page 29 ---
these guys burn up their draft cards. If Dr. Spoke and Dr. Coffin are
permitted to do this, then why send our other boys to Viet Nam to he
killed while these ores who burn un their draft cards are allowed to stay
here in the Urited States to cause trouble. And, if a guy does try to
serve the United Gtates..-.what does he ret if he is captured is "Court
Martial" because the communists took his shin...what about these euys in
Washington who permits the communists to cone to this courtry to size us
up just like they did the Pueblo before they took it over. They are more
guilty in letting the conmunists come into our country to size iup...for
we only have one country where a ship can be replaced by a better shin.
And, if its orly because of a ship ..-where was the rest of the Arericans
who were suppose to defend us...out havirg tea varties for it was their
fault for overlooking the fact hcw the communists works. By this I am

talking about Comrander Bucher. This write-up in Everybody's Say-So

prompted me to write this letter. I have a pretty darn good idea how

the communists works and by Commander Bucher's appoearance on television

I have a pretty darn rood idea what he went throuch. Not only has he really
been through it over there..."What the heck is the United States trying to

do to him now...ARR THEY TRYING TC DRIVE HIM OUT OF HTS MIND...or what?

“Why didn't they give him more ammunition?" I know how sneeky the comrunists
works and I'v sure that these more educated ren surely must know how mors
sneeky they work..-and I believe it is an oversirht on their rart more than
Commander Bucher. What were they offered or why is their nevligence justi-
fied for their oversight of ammunition cr lack of assistance?

All I car say is that you guys in Washinetor started ovt on the right
foot by getting torether and studying the cases befere you, and orly if you
keep staying on the side of justice, will we ever cet to be "United". And,
this is the only neans to prevent other assassiratiors for we do not want
any wore presidents to be assassinated regardless if they are Repvelicans or
Derocrats.

"God Bless You and Help You" to ret usiout of a mess.

very truly yours,

‘was captured and held as g/
result of the soft policy of Mr.
McNamara and the Defense
Department in their determina-
tion to appease and their will-
ingness to sacrifice men in or-
der not to disturb the Commu-
nists. In such an event there
would be need for a scapegoat
to cover all of the questions
and explain away all of the hu-
miliation we suffered as a
mation because of this experi-
ence. This scapegoat’s name
is Cmdr. Bucher.

My great aunt, Mrs. Georgia
B. Minter, was one of the early
missionaries to China. She told
us of the craftiness and cruelty
and animal tendencies of an un-
regenerated Oriental mind. She
was attacked by bandits several
times and had not the hand of
God intervened she would have
been killed.

My aunt and uncle, Mr. and
Mrs. Herman Dixon, were some
of the first missionaries to the
Islands of New Guinea, Borneo
in particular. They were cap-
tured by the Japanese during
World War II and were interned
in a concentration camp for
some three years. Their treat-
ment was beyond imagination
unless heard. from ther lips.
Their health after release was
mever again normal. Thus,
Cmdr. Bucher's account of his
torture .and treatment seem
very familiar ‘to me. Could any
of us have gone through it as
well? Would we have been

tain slaughter? Would we have
tried to fight knowing we
were completely surrounded?

Can we, Mr. President, as a
democratic nation, pride our-
selves on our democracy. ‘The
Land of the Free, the Honie of
the Brave” and then ‘strip a
man of his honor, his dignity,
and even his sanity in order
to. do a “cover up job’ for
those in authority who did not
ido their job? Will this be
another Billy Mitchell case?
Will a man be sentenced to die
of a broken heart? I trust not,
Mr. Nixon. — MRS. GEORGE
