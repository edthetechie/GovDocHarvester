Gentlemen:

I believe that the American public have a right to know
why the trial of Sirhan Sirhan, the alleged murderer

of Senator Robert Kennedy, has been delayed for so

long. The latest word is that an agreement has been
made between the lawyers and judges involved to

delay the trial until next year!

It is just this sort of thing that has all decent,
law abiding Americans worried and deeply disturbed
about the multitude of ways the laws as they now
exist serve to protect a person arrested for a crime,
while failing to protect the public at large.

Another example of how criminals are benefiting from
the law while the citizenry must suffer from it stems
from the so-called Bail Bond Reform Act of 1966.

While it may be said that a person arrested for a
crime is innocent until proven guilty, it must also

be realized that persons arrested for serious felonies
may be a danger to the public, and should, in the name
of God, be kept in jail until brought to trial. Then
if he is found innocent he could be reimbursed.

The key to both of the above mentioned problems is
a swift trial. Without swift justice we will never
have "law and order" in this eeeeery I trust you

will reply to this ar 2 r Oe:

The Honerable Lyndon B. Johnsen
President of the United States,
The White House,
Washingten, D. C.

Dear Mr. President:

rewire ad aan

te

My consciente impells me to cry eut to my President ani: - pt rn Se
electorate against the evilest censpiracy our country has ever

faced. This igs a conspiraay te continue te control the military-
industrial-political policy of our democracy after the 1968 elec—

tions by means of pelitical expleitatien of the assassinations of

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.

This censpiracy fdhlows the successful conspiracy to assassinate
President John F. Kennedy before the 196 elections to protect the
assumed prerogative of the Complex-eontrolled Central Intelligence
Agency against Presidential eppesition to make foreign pdlicy by
its role of prevosateur in U. S. military operations and foreign
goverment coups.

Before these statements are osdled preposterous, I hasten to add
that this conspiracy is profesaionally rated ab 50% prowability

of being correct and 50% probab@ity of being incerrect or one
chance out of two of being correct. On the other hand, the gov-
ernment's view that all three assassinations occurred without con-
spiracy.of sponsors is rated at 5% er ene ehance out of 20 of
being correct.

Although there are really no counter-conspiracy probability analysts
that provide such services professionally yet, my elaim to profess-—
ional reliability is based upon two desades of counter-censpiraey
and. agtion against the political arm of what President Eisenhower
called the military~industrial camplex. I also qualify by having
predicted the Krushchev-Castro Cuba missiles crisis conspiracy to.
the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Logistics, in March, 1960. I
predicted the time of execution of the conspiraoy within three
months, the approximate plase (within intermediate ballistic
migsile range of U. S.) and the type of weapon to be employed in
the showdewn. I also predicted that the result would be nuclear
war or alternatively, a political settlement.

Now both brothers whe achieved that settlement for America and the
world in the fase of a Complex retaliatory poliey have been assass-
inated. A new Gamplex-ingpired geampaign for the 1968 season to

close the "strategic capsbildty gap" in a new arms race is under

way. The Kennedy brothers! cause ef world peace through negotiations
is virtually fergotten except for meaningless campaign prepaganda

py the right-wing ferees of reaction. The Nebel peace prize winner
whe proved te eppressed peeples of the world as well as those of his
own country that non-vielent revolution through reform could be
successful is alse slain by probable conspirasy. This predictably

AWG! S193

spurred young black nationalists to bear and use arms through frus-
tration and a foreign ideology which in turn gave excuse for massive
police and troops retaliation under the thinly disguised political
slogan of "Law and order" which emerged from the witches' brew of
the assassination of the political leader of non-violence.

President Eisenhower warned succeeding Presidents and the American
people against the evil eonspiraterial power of the "Complex"
the following words of his farewell address in 1961:. .

"In the Couneils of Goverment we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
unsought, by the military—industrial camplex. The poten-
tial for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists
and will persist."

It is ominous that so soon after this warning the next President
was the vietim of disastrous misinformatien deliberately pre-
vided him by the Gentral Intelligence Ageney and confirmed by
the Joint Chiefs of Staff to trap him into military intervention
by the armed ferces of the United States to establish not just

a simple non-comunist goverment but an ultra-right-wing govern-
ment in Cuba. It is ominous that the secret report en the causes
of the Bay of Pigs disaster that the alain President requested of
Robert F. Kennedy and General Maxwell Tayler has never been made
public. .

It is ominous that about a year before the 196 elections when a
pradent President might have been expested to release the report,
take corrective action against Complex military proeurement teams,
and geek an electoral mandate for 1965 against the Gamplex and the
GIA, twe mysterious resignations and a "suicide" occurred in the
Complex team under the Secretary of the. Air Forge. These myster-
ious events were followed in another month by the assassination

of the President.

It is ominous that after the assassination the nominees of the

two corporations that have been for twe desades diresting political
strategy of the Complex and were closely involved with the Complex
team in which the resignations and suicide occurred, were elevated
to seats in the Cabinet.

Most ominous of all is that there is net"Complex issue" in the 1968
election nor any warning from the incumbent President of its grewing
evil anti~demoeratin power in spite of two more politieal assassin-
ations of sworn enemies of Casplex' polieies. On the contrary, the
false issue of the "strategic capability gap" effering tens of
Billions of new business for the Complex has been offieielly raised
by the Republican nominee in his acceptance speech just as the

false issue of the "missile gap" was raised by the Democrabie nan
inee in 1960. This."issue' has not been challenged by the Democratic

Party.



--- Page 27 ---
(3)

Consequently, unless there is a virtual revolution at the Democratic
Convention the American electorate will go to the polls in November,
virtually disenfranchised, to vote for one of three Canplex-supporting
mornmees of their parties, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon and George
Wallace.

The Complex has attained its greatest power under your Administration
although it has increased its evil powere under each post-war Admin-
istration starting with Harry Truman's. You shoulder no greater blame
than the other three post-war presidents for pouring out a trillion
dollars into defense armament and services while our minorities still
Live under poverty in ghettos. In fact, you have passed more civil
rights, education and other social legislation measured in real bene-
fits than all three other Presidents put together. Nevertheless,
there is evidence that the American electorate and perhaps even
history is looking for a scapegoat. It might be you. I am thoroughly
opposed to blaming the error of Presidents when the real responsibility
lies with the American electorate of which I am a guilty member.

Paradoxically, Mr. President, you have the greatest opportunity of any
president to reverse the trend and return power to the American elector-
ate and the Presidency. You are not yet committed to any candidate

nor to the Complex. The Complex, on the other hand, may be setting

you up to preside over the Liquidation of the Anerican two-party

system of electorate control over the goverment.

You have the power to meaningfully investigate the Complex-favoring
assassinations, the Complex wholesale corruption of the military
supply stream up to the White House itself, and the usurpation of
foreign policy making by the Central Intelligence Agency before your
termis over. You have the power and the means to really unify the
country with a call for a government of national union. You have the
power and the means to assure that your President: John F. Kennedy,

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy will not have died in
vain and that their followers will have a ticket to identify with in
November, : .

You still have time to set the pattern for peace, not only in South
Vietnam but in Southeast Asia; not only in Southeast Asia but in the
Third World; not only in the Third World but in all Three Worlds of
our globe. I feel that I have the right to ask that you be drafted
for this job because I voted for you in 1964 and voted for Democratic
candidates all my life before I was disenfranchised for the 1968
elections by the obsolete convention system each of which are non-
inating men with less than majority support of the Ameriean electorate.
Only a government of national union can command majority support this
year; the failure of the convention system will assure four parties.


--- Page 28 ---
(4)

I realize that the raising of the Complex Supergovernment issue and
the demand for independent investigation of the assassinations of
the three greatest democratic activists of our time will be tempor-
arily divisive. This division, however, will be followed by unity
in support of a truly national union ticket designed to preserve the
very great democratic advantages of the two-party system until less
divisive times. I do not believe in my study of the political factors
involved that contrary choices of the Republican and Democratic con-
ventions can prevent the sweep of a genuine national union ticket in
which partisan political advantage is foresworn. Public opinion
polls could easily check this political phenomenon. The activist
pressures of the far right and the far left that threaten to divide
America into four pdlitical parties in actual political civil war if
not armed civil war by 1972 can be soundly defeated by appealing to
the political conscience of the great democratic center majority of
the American electorate.

As a rank and file political activist I want to vote American in 1968.
I want to vote for national union. I dontt want to watch helplessly
as the Republicans splinter rightward under the impact of the Amer-
ican Independent Party and the Democrats splinter leftward under the
impact of an Administration candidate identified with the Camlex

and escalation of the war in Vietnam. .

Therefore, I implore you to help give me and all the other followers
of the slain leaders of democratic activism a chance to make the
cause of these martyrs live as their living memorial.

I am sending copies of "Assassinations of the Industrial State" to
Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, to Senator Eugene McCarthy,
to Senator Edward Kennedy, and a copy to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee with a request for investigative action into the subversion
of foreign policy by the Complex and the CIA.

Dear

President Johnson has referred to this Department
your correspondence concerning the report of the National
Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. I apologize
for the delay in responding.

In an effort to ascertain the causes of last
summer's disturbances, President Johnson appointed a
National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. In
establishing such a committee to search for causes
and solutions to this American tragedy the President
recognized that in America "we seek more than the
uneasy calm of martial law. We seek peace based on
one man's respect for another--and upon mutual respect
for Law."

One of the recommendations of the Kerner Commission
report was that open housing legislation be enacted.
Earlier this year the Congress passed, and the President
signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibits dis-
crimination or segregation in the sale and rental of most

housing in the country.

Please be assured that all other observations and
recommendations of the Commission have been made known
and are currently being considered by appropriate govern-
ment officials.

Honorable Mr. Clark; os.
& short time ago, 1 wrote you about difficulty about reply

not recieved from a Bronx stamp dealer. .

>: y am now in receipt of the stamp, after 1 had infommed him that

1 would seek means for return of same.

I was concerned about the stamp, as a catalogue in a public
library listed the value of the stamp at around 4350.00.

I do not know if the stamp can be sold, but will not try to sell

by mail again.
Thank you for any service rendered, or reply yet to be recieved,

Sincerely,

Ate. £ @

P.S. I was very happy to hear today on the news, that Senator
Edward Kennedy does not plan to accept invitation to be Vice-
President.

As much as I wanted <enator Robert Kennedy for our next Presidnet,
TI now wish he had never aspired to anything but a Senator.

Tf so, maybe he would have still been with us.

1 am of the belief that there may be a conspiricy, or maybe just
a result of hate preaching such as done by people like Carl McIntire
of Collingswood, New Jersey.

E ay ists “F
r have managed to get him removed from our ation some

Carl MeIntire, of Collingswood, N.J. calls himself a preacher,
and, although I have not heard his radio message recently, I
have heard him in the vast speak as if he hates the United States,

His literature is the same old tired line it has been, and he
has my Mother's Church, the Assembly of god, believing that we -

are going to be teken over by Communism any day.

He is soliciting large funds from tha old-age pensioners to fight
this Communism, and these peovle believe hin.
I am now living in this environment, so I know.

However, I am not living here by choice.

I believe preaching such as this could, and probably has influen-~

ced persons such as Sirhan Sirhan, and the practice is very danger~

ous.
IT hope he can be stopped from all radio.

Possibly you can tune in his broadcasts from your area, or if not,
would you send for some of his literature under an assumed name?

Thanks
