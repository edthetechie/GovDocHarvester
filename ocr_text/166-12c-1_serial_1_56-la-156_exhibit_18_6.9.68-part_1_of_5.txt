Peking courts Eastern Europe

By Paul Wobt
Written for The Christian Science Monitor

Communist China looms big in the Soviet
Unien's now tenuous relations with Eastern
Europe.

Tt iy welll known in Moscow that Warsaw
and Bucharest cultivate contacts with Pe-
king. But in the rest of Eastern Europe, too,
China casts a shadow.

Moscow is disturbed about subtle Chinese
insinuations, through broadcasts and diplo-
matic channels that the Soviet Union not
cnly flirts with the United States (which
would not disturh most East Europeans),

but that it actually wears an “‘anti-Bonn
mask" and seeks “to embrace the West
German militarists.""

For some time, Chinese Communist
spokesmen have urged policymakers in
¥ East Berlin, Prague, and Budapest
not to take seriously Soviet warnings of West
German revanchism and imperialism

‘To buttress their argument the Chinese
Point to secret talks between West German
Foreign Minister Willy Brandt and the So-
viet Ambassador in Bonn, Semyon T.

Tsarapkin, to conversations between West
Berlin Mayor Klaus Schuetz and the Soviet
Ambassador in East Berlin, Pyotr A, Abrasi-
mov, and to the increasingly frequent ex-
change of parliamentarians, journalists,
and trade-union officials between West Ger-
many and the Soviet Union,

Influence assessed

China plays a greater role in the thinking
of East European Communists than gen-
erally assumed. East Europeans remem-
ber that in 1956 Chinese Premier Chou En-
Ini toured their capitals as a mediator be-
tween restive East European factions and
the Soviet Unien,

China still is considered in East Euro-
pean capitals a possible counterweight
against Soviet efforts to reestablish central
leadership in international communism.
Even the Yugoslavs, who are regularly’
abused by Communist China, always de-
fend China's right to independence from
‘Moscow.

The Chinese, who do not quote Karl Marx
very much, recently have come up with a
quotation from him to stress China's im-

U.S. lays Peru aid cut

to arms opposition

By James Nelson Goodsell
Latin America correspondent af
The Christian Science Monitor

Panama City

The cutoff of United States development
toans to Peru is evidence that Washington
wants to head off a possible arms race in
Latin America—and at the same time is
prepared to take stiff measures to back
up its desire.

In Peru's case, Washington argues that
an estimated $20 million the nation is
spending to purchase 12 French supersonic
Mirage jet fighters is more than the. eco-
nomically depressed country should spend.

Peru made the decision to buy the jets
last December after the U, S, put exten«
sive pressure on the government of Fer=
nando Belatinde Terry to forgo the pur-
chase. The Mirage jets, when delivered,
will become the first supersonic fighters
in_Lauin America

‘The State Department action last week
was in accordance with the amendment to
the 1968 forcign-assistance appropriations
bill. The amendment required reduction in
economic aid by an amount at least equal
to the money spent by a developing nation
en advanced weapons such as jets or mis-

Step serves as warning

The action against Peru was the first
application of the amendment. It served
a a warning that Washington will look
with disfavor on any major military pur-
chases by hard-pressed developing nations.

About $37 million of development aid is
involved in the action against Peru.

‘The Agency for International Develop-
ment (AID) had originally requested $70
million for Peru for the 1968 fiseal year
beginning last July. Congress cut this fig-
ure to $37 million in a delayed aid measure
for the fiscal year

‘The figure involved is for both general
budgetary , support and for specific eco
nomic development projects.

‘A resumption of atd to Peru in fiseal
1089, which begins next July 1, is. still un-
decided by Washington—and apparently will
depend upon the size of Peru's defense
budget then.

‘That budget is currently under debate in
Peru's Legislature. ‘The 1968 budget allo-
cated 153 percent for defense spending in
a total figure af just under a billion dollars.
In early reports trom Lima, Peru's capital,
149 percent is reportedly being set aside
for defense in a billion-dollar budget for
1989,

Washington criticized

Reports from Lima also indicate that
Washington's actions took Peru by surprise.
Reaction in Lima newspapers ranged {rom
mild to virulent criticism of Washington for
its action. What the effect will be on future
relations between the U.S. and Peru is
uncertain, but El Comercio, one of Lima’s
morning newspapers, called for a review of
relations batween the two nations,

A State Department message on the case
recalled thut one of the key declarations
at the hemisphere presidential summit at
Punta del Este, Uruguay, in April, 1967,
was the promise by presidents to limit uns
necessary military expenditures in Latin
Americs:

‘Aa amendment on military spending was

cosponsored by Reps. Clarence D. Long
(D) of Maryland and Silvio Q,. Conte (R)
of Massachusetts,

British purchase set 2

Mr. Long said last week: “A country is
perfectly free to divert its own resources
from economic development to defense, but
not United States funds, nor should United
States funds rush in to fill the gap.’

In addition to its agreement to purchase
French Mirage jets, Peru will purchase six
Canberra jet bombers from Britain. Lon«
don decided to permit the sale despite
USS. objections which were first raised in
mid-1967 at a time when the Prench sale
of Mirages was being discussed.

Peru became the eighth Latin-American
country to purchase Mirages from France,

Brazil could be ninth. That nation’s air
commanders have been pushing the govern-
ment of Army Marshal Artur da Costa ¢
Silva to permit the purchase of planes for
the Brazilian Air Force.

It is just such a possibility that Washing-
ton’s action on Peru is designed to head
off. Peru's case is being used as a warn-
ing to the rest of Latin America that Wash-
ington means business.

portance for the revolutionary transforma-
tion of the world.

Marx once wrote: “One can confidently
predict that the Chinese revolution will set
the spark to the overflowing powder barrel
of the present industrial system and bring,
the long ripening general crisis to a
climax."”

Later, Marx restated his opinion “that
the Chinese: revolution is destined to exert
a much greater influence on Europe than
all Russian wars, Italian manifestoes, and
secret societies of the Continent.”

Counterattack launched

Among East European Marxists such
quotations may make a certain impression.
‘Their effect could be similar to that of
earlier Romanian publications of Marx's
unfavorable opinions of Russia.

ite, Soviets have taken these Chinese
allegations seriously enough 10 open a
counterattack which started with an article
in Iavestia of March 29, dealing with an
alleged rapprochement between Peking and
Bonn.

Both countries, according to Izvestia,
seek a revision of existing borders and
are interested in the maintenance of ten-
sions in Europe; both object to a treaty
against the spread of nuclear weapons,

Iavestia’s reasoning was taken up by So-
viet broadcasts to Eastern Europe. The
Soviets also point out that Bonn, contrary
to Rome and several other European capi-
tals, permits the glorification of Chairman
Mao Tse-tung and of the Red Guard:
that West German radio station:
to broadcast Chinese propaganda.

With an eye to East German critics, Mos-
cow stresses that Communist China refures
to recognize formally the existence of two
German states and refers to the Communist-
ruled German Democratic Republic as
“East Germany." Such terminological dis-
{inctions may appear excessively subtle to
Westerners, but to Communists, especially,
German Communists, they make sense.

Trade figures compared

‘Then there is the argument that West Ger-
many is China's second largest trade part-

ner after Japan, leaving Britain and France
far behind, Last year Bonn's trade with Pe-
king increased by 27.5 percent.

this attitude.

New life shown

‘One of the important results of
change is that the alliance seems to be
taking on new life," a military officer
said,

‘That's true."* a high civilian spokes-
man agreed. “In Paris the NATO system

convince us all that NATO was

again
‘A vear has passed since President d
Gaulle forced withdrawal of the alli-
2nce’s top military headquarters from
ance. The move brought the military
leadership to Casteau-Bruxelles. ‘This is
a village on the outskirts of Mons, a com+
pact old town of less than 30,000 people.

‘Wilderness’ transformed

Here. an hour's auto ride from Brus-
sels, a massive new complex of build-
ings stood ready in April, 1967, to house
SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied

s Europe) under 14 flags of the 15-
m North Atlantic Treaty Organiz;
tion, The buildings rose on land that had
been described as a “muddy wilderness”
shen the bulldozers were plowing it up
in the winter months.

Then a few months later a new ei
silian headquarters was completed 100.
‘There all 15 NATO flags can fly, includ>
ing the tricolor of France.

France hus pulled out of the inte-
grated nulitary activities of the alll-
ance. But it keeps a seat in its civilian
“cabinet,” the North Atlantic Council.
So in the austere, grayish-yellow build-
ings not far from the center of Brussels,
France cooperates with “the new
NATO" to relax European tensions,

“The French seem to drag their feet
but they at least take part, and we are
glad to have them,” non-French officials
agree.

‘Harmel Report? ready
So NATO now has approval by all 15
members for ita “Harmel Report.” This
originally seemed to run counter to
President de Gauile's ideas in two ways.
‘The report, prepared by outgoing Bel-
ian Foreign Minister Plerre Harmel,
faid there was zeal need to maintain a
deterrent against possible Communist ag-
gression in Europe at a time when the
French President was downgrading the
alliance and conducting a personal «

n though the French are not very
enthusiastic about the Harmel Peport
they have endorsed it. This has ni
rowed a little the gap that was w
ing between France and NATO in 1957
But the report red down
hopes of Natonians who wanted the ol-
iance to take strong collective moves
for relaxing world tensions. NATO now
acts mainly as a clearinghouse and for
consultation among nations making ther
own moves to improve contact with East
European countries.

New buildings better
Among physica} gains accruing from
NATO's removal from Paris are the new
buildings. Both the §32 million SHAPE
complex near Mons, and the in town
NATO offices have been planned for ef-
ficiency on the basis of years of experi
ence in the Paris region. There is no
possible comparison between the former
threadbare and undersized military
headquarters building at Rocquencourt,
near Paris and the new vast, clean-lined
structure at Mons.

‘This man was speaking of both Brus-

worry was not only about housing. “'Sup-
pose,” said a’SHAPE officer, “that most
‘of the 8,000 people at SHAPE descended
‘on Mons for an evening, bringing into
its narrow, winding, hilly old streets
about 3,000 automobiles!"

“OF course, it wouldn't happen
Uke that," a Mons citizen replied, “but
the figures give you an idea of the poss

What bas actually happened is that
‘most of the 8,000 people at SHAPE find
their entertainment on the big base.
‘There are clubs for officers, for non-
commissioned officers, and for enlisted
men. There is a fine theater and an

day nights.

‘The base includes five schools, Only the
children of parents who live away from

Clark’s nonchalance sold Rigney

By Ed Rumill

Chief sports columnist of
‘The Christian Science Monitor

In the clubhouse of the California Angels
they like to tell you what a cool character
Rick Clark is, “Sometimes it's a struggle
for him to work up a sweat, even in spring
training,” said Bob Lemon, Angels’ pitch
ing coach,

Tt was Clark's nonchalance under fire that
first impressed Bill Rigney, California's
able manager.

“Rick had worked out of the bullpen a
couple of times last season when we went
into New York,” Rigney recalled. “They
‘were having one of those give-away bat

days and Yankee Stadium was really
jammed.

“Well, all of a sudden I needed a starting
piteher and decided to take a look at Clark.
So what did he do? He jugt walked out there

t

in front of all those people, worked a fi
hhine [innings] and beat the Yanks. ‘Thi
ended his relieving career."

Ad rating from Roarke

Mike Roarke, one of Rigney's ecaches,
‘had a part in putting the pieces of the Clark
puzzle together.

“We'd had all good reports on Rick,"
Rigney continued. “Every one of our scouts

But Mr, Humphrey remains somewhat of

‘The Kennedy people would like the John-

‘Oregon primary,

But the Vice-President is taking great
pains to stay out of the state and to under-
score the fact that he really isn’t running
for president here,

‘Thus, a small vote for the Johnson-Hum~
phrey combination or a small write-in for
‘Mr. Humphrey isn’t likely to do much
damage to the Vice-President.

‘On the other hand, should there be a sig-
nificant Johnson-Humphrey vote or a sig-
nificant write-in for Mr. Humphrey (or
both), it could well dull the luster of a
Kennedy victory here.

‘The Vice-President seems to have it both
ways in this election: He's not here if his
ahowing is poor. But he gets credit if his
showing is impressive.

‘One Kennedy worker here summed it up.
“Well, that's just the way it is. We can't be
sure that these primaries are going to prove
anything, But we have no alternative but to
keep right on trying. In the end it just might
do the trick.’

Dan also concedes that turbines plus four-
wheel drive would mean much faster speeds

in seven years, mostly due to tires and
chassis. Four-whecl-drive-turbine power
could conceivably see a similar increase in

Expect, don’t hope

A golf series for the thoughtful beginner,
based on Dufferthink. Or: “How the Bad
Player can Beat his Handicap.”

By Allan Duffer

‘There was a schoolmaster in England
who taught his boys to accomplish holes
in-one,

‘They could not do it every time. They
could not do it every other time, But they
could do it with fair regularity.

So unlikely a story soon caught the expe-
Fenced ear of a newshawk. He arranged an
appointment, bringing camera and a check
book.

But on that day no boy shot a hole-in-one.
So there was no story. And nothing has been
heard of the master or his method or his
pupils in the public prints since.

Pondering upon this Englith tragedy, T
have come to the conclusion that the school+
master's method was based upon the incul
cation in the boys of the readonable expect:
tion of a successful shot. After practicin,
they knew they could hit the ball close to 3
target. Knowing that, they could expect to
hole a few close shots. Expecting it they
achieved it.

Reasonable expectations

But upon the day scheduled for the dem-
onstration, knowing it mattered, the boys
wondered if they could-make it come off. A
shade of doubt canceled cut the reasonable
‘expectation of success. And that ws

Archaeologist cites ‘decadence’

By Robert C, Cowen
Natural science editor of
‘The Christion Science Monitor

Mitla, Mexico

American archacologist John Paddock
Studies the decline and recovery af one of
Mexico's ancient Indian civilizations and
thinks of the United States today.

Among the potsherds, tombs, and ruined
buildings in this much-lived-in' valley may
lir a clue to society’s development that will
help Americans gain perspective on their
own times,

“We are trying to define decadence.”
Professor Paddock says. “Just as our own
society should ask if it's in a period of
decadence or transition, we are asking that
about phases in the development of the
society that once flourished here. In talk
ing about America’s troubles, we assume
it's decadence without asking what we
mean by it, We should question this, Per
haps in our studies here, we can pro-
‘vide some clarification.”

Mr. Paddock has rich source material,
‘You can't put your foot down in the Valley
of Oaxaca (wah-HAH-kah) without stepping
on antiquity. By an unfinished count, there
are 270 archaeological sites here, The list
will probably go over 300, And that doesn't
include any site without a pyramid. A com:
plex with only a few houses and potsherds
doesn’t even count,

Eleborate ceremonial center

At one end af the valley, the great center
of Monté Albin covers a high plateau. Be-
Rinning perhaps around 700 B.C. it grow
into one of the most elaborate and beauti-
ful ceremonial centers of the ancients,

At the other end of the vailey, Mitla re-
mains a living town after more than three
millennia of activity. Ruins of palaces in-
habited by priests and nobles in late pre-
conquest times lie at its periphery.

Men have lived in the valley for at least
10,000 years that archaeologists know about.

The valley ranges in altitude from 5,500
feet at Mitla to 4,500 at its lower end. It's
at the crucial altitude for the tropies where
you can grow most tropical plants and most

Oaxaca is rich in minerals too.

It's hard to break down Oaxacan habita

groups came and went. But for the past
several thousand years, the Zapotecs and
‘Mixtecs have dominated.

‘Today. 200,000 Mixtecs live in’ the sure

Broups.

Decline, renaissance seen

When the Spanish came here, the Mixtecs
had commanded the valley and Monté Al-
ban for several centuries, The Zapotecs who
Preceded them had somehow lost their grip.
‘Their society became decadent until’ the
‘Mixtec invasion injected new vigor.

‘This is the process af decline and renais-

evolution in South Vietnam.

‘The Soviet Union appears to have only

the 17th parallel in Vietnam, in an area

“a great deal of the reporting of criminal
matters is careless, imprevise, and inept.”

At the same time, he said the bench and

Tolkien disguised as himself

The Tolkien Relation, by William Ready.
Chicago: Henry Regnery Company. $3.95.

By Peter J. Henniker-Heaton

For everyone who hopes to be around in
1970 and after, the Tolkien books are exsen-
tial reading. The virtues and values of their
Hobbits and their Elves and their Ents, of
their Ringwraiths and their Ores, will need
to be clearly understood and grappled with
{in the decades immediately ahead of human
ity. They tell of power, the misuse of power,
and the requirement that, to avoid its cor-
ruption, power be willingly surrendered.)

‘Three million copies of a man's works,
maybe five million by now, sold mainly on
the campuses of the United States, consti-
tute a figure and a fact not to be laughed off.
‘The man is J. R. R. Tolkien, for 20 years a
Professor of Anglo-Saxon .and thereafter of
English Literature in the University of Ox-
ford, now in retirement on the city's out-
skirts

Slow-burning fuse

‘Once upon a time (which by toda
scale means between 20 and 30 years ago)
Professor Tolkien wrote “The Hobbit,”
which for protective coloring he’ called’a
children’s book. This he followed up with
‘a trilogy, entitled “The Lord of the Rings";

turn of the King.” Children delight in these
‘books; but neither the first nor the other
three are really children’s books at all. They
are books of ageless delight, of profound in-
tellectual and spiritual significance.

For some 20 years they sold slowly but
steadily, mostly in Britain. Then the slow-
burning of the fuse reached its American
detonator. Some four years ago the fusion
reaction began, The books have been ex-
ploding ever since.

‘William Ready of McMaster University,
Ontario, in “The Tolkien Relation” under-
takes (according to the book jacket) to pro-
vide “‘a readable, understandable introduc
tien to the man and his work." To say at
once that this Is nonsense is not to down-
grade Mr, Ready'’s work. The point is that
Tollien can never be understood; he must
be experienced. Second, any book about
‘Tolkien can only give the true flavor if it is
rough-hewn, homespun, slightly unread-
able, And third, Tolkien never wails to be
introduced: he brushes past his introducer
and presents himeclf three-dimensional and
foursquare. All that Mr, Ready wisely does
is to hold open a door through which his
subject may emerge.

Courage—tin or lose

‘This book discusses Tolkien as a man and
describes his ecology, South Africa, Oxford,
and various points in between, but espe-
claily Oxford. It also discusses Tolkien's
thought and the thought behind his thought
and those activities of the mind and spirit
that operate behind and below a writer's
thought. Tt all adds up to a cold shower for
those who think Bacon was Shakespear
the Tolkien described in these pages couldn't
Possibly have written Tolkien, Genius is

smething other than its vehicle. And while
{The Hobbit" may be only near-genius,
“The Lord of the Rings" iz a story quiside

‘Everyman?

of time and space and rational summariza-
tion which means genius.

‘The virtue of Mr. Ready is that he knows
the size of his subject and therefore does
not concern himself with a “petty consist-
ency.” From chapter to chapter his Tol-
kien, like Walt Whitman, contradicts him-
self, and is the greater for so doing. Per-
haps what emerges most strongly from
these contrary tides is Tolkien's preoecupa-
tion with the Norse virtue of courage for
its own sake, the joy of courage win or
lose. Not that the Tolkien brand of courage,
the Hobbit brand of courage, ever does any:
thing but win; yet the winning remains
ineidental.

Mr. Ready quotes Tolkien's words: “It
is not our part to. master all the tides of
the world, but to do what ia in us for the
succor of these years wherein we are set.”
‘The Hobbit, as Mr. Ready also points out,
is “Everyman, shaken from . , . his little
ways.” In the years ahead Everyman—all
of us are likely to be more and more shaken
from our little ways. This book's message
is that a reading and rereading and pos-
ibly repeated rereadings of “The Lord of
the Rings" will help us with delight and
courage “to do what is in us for the suc-
cor of these years wherein we are set."” It
is a most valuable un-understandable un-
readable: to Tolkien lore.

Poet with a bee-stung pout

The Survival of the Fittest, by Pamela
Hansford Johnson. New York: Charles
Scribner's Sons. $6.95.

By Melvin Maddocks

Pamela Hansford Johnson has written on
of thoze novels that seem to come with
key taped to the dust jacket. When she was
8 precocious young poet and novelist —long.
before she became Lady Snow — Miss John-
son corresponded with Dylan Thomas, “The
Survival of the Fittest” transparently f
tures a stormy, curly-headed young poet
with eyes like “chestnut fire-coals" (‘a cros
between an infant saint and a Koala bear"
‘who makes notorious reading tours of Amer-
ican campuses while careening to his pre-
mature end.

‘Jazz musicians and lyric poets who drink
themselves to an early grave are posthu-
mously guilty of a lengthening shelt of bad
novels and plays. They wear that obviously
ravaged look of the artist-as-martyr which
appeals to slothful or second-rate fiction
izers hunting for ready-made melodrama
with a builtin moral,

Detailed background

‘Miss Johnson, an industrious and capable
writer, partially escapes the inherent
clichés by trying to subordinate her Kit
Mallings, insofar as he can be subordinated.
She spends a good deal of time and care, for
instance, on backgrounds. With considerable
vividness and detail sho reconstructs the
Renerous, vulnerable responses af young
English intellectuals. to the Spanish Civil
War. From this high pitch of youth and
passion, ahe dims the lights for World War
Hf (‘the world was darkening, and. they
knew it"), and eases her ‘wild circle” into
Prosperous, middle-sged domesticity sfter
he war,

Miss Johnson further disguises the rather
grude simplicity of the doomed-artist legend
by surrounding her Orpheus with a lari
supporting cast, including a best pal of Kit
named Jo to whom she would dearly love
to sward her novel on grounds of personal
merit,

Looking back coolly

She has all her other characters say—
sed say again—that Jo is the noblest Bo-
hemian of them all. Parily by astociation
‘with a horribly possessive mother, she gives
J a blographical substance she never pro-
vides for Kit, In the end, she kills off Jo
too—martyred friend to ‘match martyred
fortist, What more can an author do to over-
compensate’

But all this desperate diversification is In
Yain= Curly-headed poeta with eyes like
“chestnut fire-coals” do not easily give up
front stage center. They are as solfshly
demanding in fiction as they can be in life.

Por better and for worse, the novel has
to rise and fall with Kit, The women he
Inves and generally mistreats, the man who
play his admiring and envying stooges live
‘a5 reflections of his ego rather than as char-
acters on their own. And finally the subject

of SunKinjrartist has a banality that Miss
Johnson's subtleties cannot refine. Kit Mal-
lings with his bee-atung pouts reigns over
the novel ke the spoiled child ina per-
missive family.

‘There in something quaint now — some-
thing a little vetvet-collared—about portraits
of the artist as a mad young man. Miss
Johnson's frequent use of “wild” to de-
scribe an extra round of two at the pub

ems almost touchingly innocent.

It is as if she had rummaged through a
tidy suburban attic, and with the help of
Souvenirs, recalled ‘a long-ago moment of
Vertigo, With decency and honest concern,
she has written about the past as though she
were trying to explain her younger self to
her children, or perhaps to the Lady Snow
tthe has become. Such a recollection is not
without interest, but it seems too remote for
passion. Kit Mallings ends up ax the cool
Greek profile carved on the old family
cameo.

Provides a clue-to the tone of “The Disney
Version," Richard Schickel's somewhat
devastating biography of an American folk-
hero. Mr. Schickel, who is a film critic for
Life magazine, has written his book as the
latter-day equivalent of the child who no
ticed that the emperor's new clothes left
the emperor decidedly exposed.

‘There are some twists to the story, how:
ever. The emperor in the fairy-tale was
told a hangerful of nothing by shifty busi
nessmen.. Walt Disney on the other hand
was a self-made king and emperor in the
best American tradition who did his own
tailoring and was misled only by himself,
never by others. His admirers (and there is
something of the admirer af Walt Dimey in
all of us) were never forced to cover up
for their sovereign. He really was clothed
and his clothes were beautiful—simply be-
cause he dressed like everybody else, not
because he wore finery or went naked.

Mr. Schickel’s deceptively innocent ex-
clamation throughout his book is roughly
the equivalent of ‘Look! The king’s clothes
are all worn out and full of holes!” It

as king

states at the outset that his biography is not
0 much of a man but of a type.

Writing the biography of a type rather
than a man, however, is a delicate task. If
the emphasis throughout ix nonetheless on a
single man es a type, the man begitis to
look Like a scapegoat. Thus one could wish
that Mr. Schickel's diatribe against middle»

values was addressed less obliquely to
its subject—or else one could wish for a
more thoughtful appraisal of the unique
qualities that enabled Disney to get to the
hhead of his particular class,

Understanding the product

‘The book has other shortcomings besides
{ts indirectness. There is vague discomfort,
for instance, in feeling that the reader is still
getting little more than an image cf Dis-
ney, even if the image is more accurate
than the “official” one. Mr. Schickel has
been forced to reconstruct Disney's life and
‘work from discussions with disgruntled em=
ployees and by researching his way through
Popular magazines. Such sources do not
Provide the basis for a definitive study.

But the blame does not fall to Mr.
Schickel. The Disney organization itself,
eager to preserve whatever is left of its
crumbling image, has apparently denied him
access to the very sources of information
that could have made possible a work of
measurable accuracy, Perhaps this reluc~
tance on the part of the institution says
more than the whole of Mr. Schickel's at-
tempt to get at the truth without their help,

“The Disney Version" is an invaluable
beginning, however, in cutting through the
dusty layers of unthinking and uneritical

sceptance that have helped obfuscate the
artistic and ideological merits and_short-
comings of the Disney product. If Mr.
Schickel has done no more than to highlight
the fact that it is basically a product—mass-
produced and standardized, machine-made
and meant for easy consumption and steady
profits—then he has performed an inyal
uable service.

Bought smiles

He has, of course, done more. Whatever
the ultimate accuracy of his intuitive judg-
ments proves to be, he has made a public
statement demanding thoughtful reexam-
ination of an entire set of belicts adhered
to by millions with a zeal approaching

n"—a book that quei
tions a way of life and a system of values
both exemplifted and exploited by Walt Dis-
ney—has the virtues and limitations of any
work that sets itself in opposition to a trae
dition, While it will doubtless open the
minds of many to some second thoughts
about its subject it will also enrage many
to whom a plea for reexamination is tanta-
mount to heresy.

If much of the book's concern seems to
be with the expansion of a business rather
than with the development of an individual
‘working in a major artistic medium, this is
unavoidable. Disney's ultimate concern was
with real esiate, not ideas. That Disneyland,
with its neatly frosted ‘commercialism—
‘was his passionate interest for years and
yeara says a great deal about the whole
Disney approach to life, Perhaps nothing
says as much, however, as this grim pai

bored, and even if it is a rough day, we op-

nothing else helps, remember that you get

Individual worth is immeasurable

Written for The Christen Seveeee Menitne

In this present age the dignity
and worth of the Individual are
increasingly treasured. Effosts to
bring practical recognition of the
individual's worth to segments of
mankind have extended over the
Years and have often been accom
panied by strife and bloodshed.

Rebellion against the submersion
of the individual in the mass has
been marked both by wise forms
of protest and by lawlessness and
immorality. History records prog-
Tess as a consequence of the first
approach and chaos and frustration
as the result of the latter.

But startling human progress
will come as men learn to know
themselves at they really are and
as they recognize the immeasur~
able worth of their true selfhood,

bas

Christian Science, which wholly
follows the Bible, comes to show
men their full stature not as cor
pareal beings but as spiritual ideas
emanating from God, good. the
only real Mind and Life, It teaches
that man is infinitely important to
God as His highest idea, His ex
pression, As such, man ever mani-
fests the intelligence, beauty, good-
ness, and perfection of his ereator.
Without ideas the one Mind would
be without entity. Therofore no in
dividual spiritual idea is ever uns
important; each is precious to God,

The distinctness of all true ine
dividuality is maintained through
out eternity. Mary Baker Eddy, the
Discoverer and Founder of Chris-
ttan Science, writes in "Science
and Health with Key to the Serip-
tures” (p. 70), “The divine Mind
maintains all identities, from a
blade of grass to a star, as distinct
and eternal.” And on page 259,
“Man is not absorbed in Deity, and
man cannot lose his individuality,
for he reflects eternal Life; nor ix
hhe an isolated, solitary idea, for he
represents infinite Mind, the sum
of all substance.”

ae

One. may think of the sun as
symbolizing God and each ray as
an individual idea, Just as each ray
lights up an area and has existence
as Jong as its source exists, 30

Steering a

rents of contrasting opinions
isn’t easy. But Mahmoud Mes-
tiri, chairman of the United
Nations committee on ending
colonialism, is managing it
well.

By Mario Rossi
Bpacie correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor

United Nations, N.Y.

NISIA'S MAHMOUD MESTIRI HAS TO CON-
fend with many a challenge. As chairman of the United
Nations committee for the ending of colonialism, this
is to be expected,

But Ambassador Mestirl knows the moods of the
blocs and aligoments within the United Nations and
accomplishes his task without ruffling too many
feathers,

‘The West is often impatient with the United Nations
and even with the committee over colonialism. Mr.
Mestiri is aware of this. He may even sympathize,
Bot to him the basic issue is unmistakably clear,

“The problem is not the merits or the demerits of
colonialism, whether it is good or bad," he stated in
an inte! “The General Assembly disposed of that
Issue eight years ago when it proclaimed colonialism
‘was evil arid that all territories under colonial adminis-
tyatjon should be granted immediate freedom,

‘Transfer outlined:

‘The General Assembly declaration was very specific.
It stated:

“Immediate steps shall be taken, in trust and non
seli-governing territories or all other territories which
hhave not yet attained independence, to transfer all
powers to the peoples of those territeries, without any
conditions or reservations, in accordance with their
freely expressed will and desire, without any distinc
tion as to race, erced or colour, in order to enable
them to enjoy complete independence and freedom.”

‘The Assembly declaration, he added, represents the
framework within which the committee operates

“I can only axsume this premise is accepted by all
countries agreeing to participate in the work of the
committee, including the United States and the otter
Western countries," he stated.

During the eight years. since the declaration was
adopted some progress was made but not enough by
far to satisfy a majority of UN members. While some
mall tecritories, mostly ministates, were granted
independence the situation in the southern part of
Africa has remained unchanged.

‘The fact that South-West Attica, Southern Rhodesia,
and the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola
are farther away than ever from gaining independence
4s causing considerable resentment.

Fundamentally, the contrast is between those who
take, the General Assembly declaration literally and
the “realists.” The former complain that all nonselfe
governing lerritories should have become independent

Most of these 20 quarrelsome essays haye

pulled himself out of by his own bootstraps
and anybody who thinks it is stands lost in

One readfauthe ossays are cantankerous
while attempting to be — and being — con-

‘And they are the ones who still believn,
along with the first American colonists, that

Hial success and that giving direct Gnancial
‘id to the poor destroys thelr character.””

‘The unanimous view from the Left is thot
America has never resolved its own schizo-
phrenic view of the poor which says that
the poor are burdens as well as being honor-
able victims,

‘The book's authors agree that poverty in
America for 35 million poor (poor is defined
aa an income unde @ year for a fam)
Wy of four) is a disgeace. Grandpa,
charge, has been saying that the poor th
Selves are the disgrace and, he has helped
to fashion the welfare progeams accordingly
“which means punitively.

Although the 20 authors do not agree on
specific sehitions for poverty, there. sol
Hons all come in the form of more money—

given with more dignity and {

‘The new misunderstood poor,
like essayist Michael Harrington, are caught
in a “downward spiral of pessimism." He
describes the poor ws young, as being out-

He writes: “I have never understood why

that things are bad, you must insist that they
are getting worse. I would argue that they

could well be getting a little better..."

For the readers who may label as “far-
fetched” the ideas put forward by those
‘who view America’s social problems from
the Left, it may be surprising to learn that
ideas—such as a guaranteed minimum in+

implementation of them would be new.

Irving Howe, editor of Dissent and co-
editor of this book, notes: “The program:

*Morse seen leading in Oregon Senate race

hawk. Yet he is also considered an ardent
Uberal.

‘Now, by the best political lights here, Mr,
Duncan is trailing again. The latest polls
show him behind Mr, Morse by 10 percent.
‘And Mr. Morse now says, “I'm ready to go
to a vote.” Five months ago, when the cam+
paign was first cranking up, Mr. Duncan
was ahead in the polls,

‘keep Mr. Duncan from winning.

Mr. Morse has made a career of defying
his own party, whichever one he happened
to belong to at the moment,

He was elected to the Senate in 1944 as a
Republican. But he bolted the GOP in 1952
= the year President Eisenhower first ran
for president.

‘By 1056, when Mr. Morse ran again for
reelection, he was a Democrat, Now many
leaders in the Democratic party in Oregon
can't wait to see him beaten. In 1968 the
crusty Mr. Morse not only didn't back Mr.
Duncan against Mr. Hatfeld, but he told
everybody he was going to vote for the
Republican, a fellow dove,

Labor, a strong political force in Oregon,
has developed a split personality over the
Senate race. Mr. Morse, perhaps the n:
tion's leading expert in labor law, is in line
next year to head the powerful Senate Li
bor Committee. So he is backed by lal
national leadership. But Mr. Duncan is also
a long-time friend to labor. And Oregon
labor officially is keeping hands off the race.

“To back either one,” says soft-talking
George W. Brown, Oregon labor's leading
political analyst, “would have started a
civil war in this state that might have hurt
us in the general election. As it is we a

On the stump both Mp. Morse and Mr.
Duncan are immensely human, likable, and

‘Senator Morse doesn’t really campaign in
the classical sense. He just sort of shows up

body for a vote. And whenever asked to say
‘a few words, he tried to get out of it — a
very uncampaignlike thing to do.

But he likes to get a clump of Oregon
constituents against the corral fence to chat
informally about public affairs. And in the

and students in the nation’s colleges and
universities to stem the tide of campus
demonstrations.

“They must make their collective voices
heard in standing up for the true meaning
of academic freedom if our system of high:
er education, both public and private, is to
survive," Governor Reagan told about 4,000
persons gathered for a political rally,

‘The Governor, a potential candidate for

“Tf students, urged on and supported by

take over and threaten cur higher-education

it won't be taking over society itself?" he
said.

‘He said, “Help must come within the
campus" to solve the student unrest across
the nation.

Although Louisiana GOP party officials
now favor former Vice-President Richard
M. Nixon for the presidential nomination,
Mr. Reagan got an enthusiastic reception
at the political gathering.

He lashed out at the nation's welfare
program, calling it a “colossal and almost
complete failure,"’ and criticized the anti-
poverty program for what he called its high

Oregon's Republican governor, Tom Me-
Call, for a few fleeting weeks thought about
Tunning for the Senate, He finally decided
not 10, partly because he would rather re-
main Governor. But also because he just
didn't cherish the possibility of having to
take on. Mr. Morse. “Running against
Morse," says Governor McCall, “is a ter-
rible experience. He still hurls the flame
better than anybody else.”

Yet the Senator on the stump is folksy
fame thrower. Usually at his side is his
petite wife, Midge, whom the Senator court-
ly introduces to everybody who comes. in
range.

“They've been good to us, Mama
‘would remind Mrs. Morse. Or whei he was
‘bout to head)for the other end of the barn
he would demand of his press aide or this
reporter, "Where did Mama go?” And we'd
all have’to look for Midge.

Senator Morse is proud of his record in
education legislation. (And he talks more

bout that than he does Vietnam. He talks
‘bout Mr, Duncan not at ait. “I'm not tak-
ing Duncan's bait," he says, when asked
about his opponent, who has raked hard at
the Senator.

Morse directly challenged

Mr. Duncan has made Mr. Morse the
issue in the campaign. He tells Oregonians
on the stump that they need ‘a Senator

fulnese—he is 47—and his wil

Many Democrats irate

Mr. Duncan, a Scot, whose trademark is
a fapping plaid tle, conjures up the paral-
Jel of Bunker Hill. “Israel, Putnam," he
says, “told the men, ‘Don't shoot until you
see the whites of thelr eyes.* That's our
strategy, too. Of course, the Redcoats did
xget pretty far up that hill before they final-
ly shot.”

Many Democrats in this state now think

Mr, Morse indeed probably has gotten too
{ar up the hill now to beat,

‘Yet Mr. Duncan does enjoy a deep well
ot support among Democratic leaders who
hhave had all they can take of Mr, Morse’s
infidelity to party, And he is endorsed by
Jeading dailies around the state, including
the influential Portland Oregonian,

‘There is talk in Oregon of a big body
of Republicans’ switching over in the pri-
mary to vote against Mr. Morse,too. But
Governor MeCall, a Republican given to
remarking on Democratic affairs, says, “A
Jot of Republicans want to keep Duncan
‘out of there.

“They know that if he is ever selected
he would patch the Democratic Party back
together and keep the GOP from winning
the seat for a long time. As it is, Morse
manages to keep the Democrats all the
time in turmoil.’

Moderation offered

‘Mr, Duncan wouldn't disagree. He makes
much of being a potential moderating voi
in public affairs. And he campaigns hard
against the Morée maverickism. He says,
“"Morse's chickens—the violent attacks on
the President and the administration—are
‘coming home to roost.’

‘Mr. Morse, by most political calculation,
Js outspending Mr. Duncan three to one,
‘We hit hard and early on radio and TV and
with billboards around the state, Mr, Dun-
‘ean charges that the Senator is ‘on his way
to the first million-dollar campaign for the
Senate in Oregon history. 1 can't hope to
keep up with that. So I'm substituting hand-
shakes and shoe leather for dollars.” He
also has\ put together what he terms "the

ties,"

‘The Vietnam: issue, since Paris peace
talks started, is muted here. Neither man
talks much about #t, Certainly it isn't the
fesue it was in Mr, Duncan's race against
Mr, Hatfield two years ago.

Mr, Duncan clearly has made Mr. Moree
himself the centerpiece of the campaign.
And the Senator himself admits he has a
hard time not being an issue. “You can't
follow my independent course of action and
not expect to become the issue in a cam-
paign.” And his eyes sparkle a bit as he
says it. ei

Bargaining power grows * .

Public-employee strike rights?

Experts in. labor-management. relations
have been asked 0 respond to a recent
Monitor report on collective bargaining.
Seventh and last of @ series of “dialogues”
compiled by Ed Townsend, today’s discussion
asks! what about public-employee unions
nd strikes?

Special to The Christian Science Monitor

New York ©

The recent Memphis strike of Negro
garbagemen, members of the American
Federation of State, County, and Municipal
employees, was a public-employee strike
with strong civilsrights overtones,

Even so, it demonstrated once again that
public workers, once substantially unor
ized, are developing muscle and militancy,
‘Today they are a labor force that can't be
Agnored,

William E. Simkin, director of the Fed-
eral Mediation and Conciliation Service, re-
cently said that the “new wave of strikes”
by public employees is roughly parallel to
the situation in the mass-production indus
tries in the 1930's, when factory workers
engaged in sitdown strikes and other dem-
onstrations because they felt they needed
organization and militaney to keep pace
With workers in other industries.

According to Mr. Simkin, teachers and
other public workers “heretofore substa:
tially unorganized” can be expected to jo
unions and that as they do, strikes are
evitable—they will spread.”

Aas

‘Spokesmen for the American Federation
of Teachers and the American Federation
of State, County, and Municipal Employees
don't hedge even a little on that. They say
the strikes of 1967 were “only the begin-

ning” and predict there will be even more
this yea
‘This is a matter of public concern. The

strikes are against the public, and the bar-
Baining and strikes involve ind
complex problems. There is concern about
the rights of the public employees—and con-
cern about the rights of the public itself,
Serious studies are under way, secking a
balanced solution.

One of those involved is Theodore W.
Kheel, New York lawyer, mediator, and ar-
bitrator whose testimony was sought by the
‘New York Legislature in hearings called to
‘seek equity in law for all in public-employee
disputes.

Earlier, in an interview with The Christian
Science Monitor, Mr. Khel said that publi
employees should have a right to bargain
collectively, that if they do, there must be a
Possibility of strikes, but that the right to
strike must be subordinated to “superior
public rights" if danger to life and property
should be involved, Wherever strikes are
curtailed, he said, ‘some alternative . . .
must be substituted."

‘Mr. Kheel would not place teachers “high
fon the list of those whose right to bargain
collectively should be subordinated,”

es

Others of a panel of experts who replied
fo The Christian Science Monitor's ques-
tions on this subject showed a divergence
of views:

Howard Jensen, vice-president and gener-
al counsel, Lene Star Steel Company:

‘is is completely inconsistent with a the-
‘ory of government which is responsible to
its citizens and taxpayers to permit bi
gaining between employees and the govern-
ment which has the inevitable effect of im-
‘posing new taxes not initially agreed to by
the voter or legislature, 1 agree that bar-
gaining. implies the right to strike, and for
this reason I think collective bargaining by
public employees should not be permitted.”

Dr, Morrison Handsaker, head of Depart-
ment of Economics, Lafayette College, vet-
eran arbitrator:

May, public workers now Have ie right
to organize and negotiate, 8 ileg
for them to atrike. 1 agree that they
shouldn't be allowed to strike, but some
machinery. must be established as an
femative to the strike” Dr. Handsaker ig
basically in agreement-with a principle o
tthe International Labor Organization in Ge-
neva, that if the right to strike is denied
to government workers, they should be given
‘conciliation procedures to use and, if neces-
sary, access to an arbitration board whose
awards should be fully and promplly imple-
mented,

‘It may finally be necessary to rethinke
the whole matter of labor relatons invalv-

public employees, but for the time be-
ing F tise hia worliwhiie nod iuereniog
to experiment with laws on compulsory ar-
bitration. . . . The feeling exists that com-
Dulsory arbitration in private disputes dis-
courages good, bard collective bargaining.
‘The partes aren't faced with a strike dead-
Aine, which often brings about a settlement."

“This fa often true in the private rector,
but itimay not be the case in disputes in:
volving public. employees," says Dr. Hand-
taker, who concedes he nds himself “in

Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirta:

“It is today perfectly clear that 10,000,000
(4) American citizens, government em-
Ployees, are not going to accept an employ-
ment relationship “which is built on’ the
Proposition that their employers exercise a
sovereignty which makes it Jese majesty
fo file a grievance and which equates dis-
‘agreement—at least if it is organized—with
disloyalty. . . .

“It ought to be accepted generally that
sone effective form of bilateral and repre-
sentatlonal labor relations is inevitable, is
proper, and most of all is desirable in pub-
Wie employment in this country, . . . To
whatever extent the development’ of ‘new
doctrines—jointly by representatives of all
who will be affected—of public employment
relationships is focused or is permitted to
center around the argument about whether
there is a right of public employees to
strike, that development is going to be at
best delayed, or worst defeated... .

“Every strike by public employees
creates at least as great a crisis of public
opinion as it does a crisis of transportation
of education or whatever else may be
involved. ..

Secretary Wirtz suggests provisions for
organizational and representational rights
for all public employees, substantially’ simi-
Jar to those provided by Wagner and Taft-
Hartley Acts tor private employees, plus
an agency for handling organizational and
Fepresentational disputes,

In the bargaining area, he calls for ‘some
table, some place, whether in executive,
legislative, or some independent office,
‘across the table from somebody with the
authority and the courage to say ‘I will?
instead of I can't”

On strikes Mr. Wirtz says: “An attempt
to distinguish between various kinds of
governmental functions in terms of their es-
sentiality seems to me fruit
standing of it, no more essential than school
teachers. . . | Every governmental function
is essential in the broadest terms... ,

‘In almost every instance the government
1s the only supplier of the service involved-—
and there is a serious question in my
mind about the legitimacy of any strike
which deprives the public of something it
needs very much and which it can't get
someplace else. I come to the conclusion
that the sound doctrine of public y-
ment is one that astures and” guaranties’
reasonable and a fair procedure—with in-
dependent third-party determination if

necessary—for settling new contract dis-
Putes, and which @oes not include the
