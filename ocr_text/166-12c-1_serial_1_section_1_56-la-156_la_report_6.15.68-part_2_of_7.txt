ROOSEVELT GRIER, 1148 South Spaulding, Los Angeles,
California, telephone 936-6441, furnished the following
informatio-to Special Agents JAMES CAGNASSOLA, JR. and WILLIAM P.
CRAWFORD from the FBI:

At approximately 7:30 p.m. on June 4, 1968, GRIER
arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, 3400 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California, and went directly to the coffee shop.
GRIER was alone at this time. At approximately 8:09 p.m.
he observed Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY walk past the coffee
shop followed by his wife ETHEL. and other unrecalled individuals.
ETHEL KENNEDY observed GRIER and invited him to the KENNEDY
suite on the fifth floor of the hotel. GRIER did not go
directly upstairs at that time but rather went to the "press
room" where he was interviewed by members of the news media.
He then went to a ballroom which was downstairs and which was
occupied by KENNEDY campaign workers. GRIER thereafter went
to the fifth floor of the hotel and arrived there at approximately
9:39 - 19:30 p.m.

Upon arriving at the KENNEDY suite he went to the
room which was being used by KENNEDY officials. This room
was located to the right of the room being used by Senator
KENNEDY and his family. During this time he spoke with Mrs. JOHN
GLENN, JOAN BRADEN who was in charge of the Women for KENNEDY
campaign in California and BLANCHE WHITAKER (phonetic) who is
the wife of JAMES WHITAKER, a friend of the KENNEDY family and
RAFER JOHNSON. GRIER spoke to Senator KENNEDY about the
California primary election returns and relayed a message from
PIERRE SALINGER who requested that he tell KENNEDY that he,
meaning KENNEDY, was leading with 50 percent of the votes
returned in San Francisco. KENNEDY asked GRIER if SALINGER
wanted to talk to him and GRIER replied no.

At an unrecalled time Senator KENNEDY left his suite
and went to the fourth floor to be interviewed for telévision.
GRIER noticed that neither BILL BARRY, KENNEDY's personal body’
guard, nor RAFER JOHNSON wets: in the area at this time and
GRIER decided to escort KENNEDY to the fourth floor, At the

interviews and during the second interview GRIER observed
BARRY join Senator KENNEDY and he decided to go downstairs
to one of the ballrooms. Prior to his departure BARRY told
GRIER "Don't go too far because the Senator is coming down’
Senator KENNEDY also asked GRIER if he was leaving and GRIEF
indicated he would return in a short while. GRIER left the
fourth floor at approximately 11:00 oy 11:30 p.m. and went
to the door of the press room. At this time he heard the
security guard talking to some individuals, identities unknown,
informing them that they could not enter the press room without

a passe. As GRIFR looked at the security guard, the guard

motioned to the right with his head indicating to GRIER that -

he could gain access to the room by entering the door to the

right of the main doors. GRIER . turned and entered this door,
proceeded to a kitchen area and entered the press room from a

rear or side entrance, He remained there for an unrecalled period
of time. GRIER thought that it was strange that the main

entrance was guarded yet a person could pass through the

kitchen and enter the rear or side door of the press room

without being stopped.

ra

After completing his business in the press. room
GRIFR returned to the KENNEDY suite on the fifth floor and
observed that the Senator was preparing to go to the ballroom
to deliver nis victory speech. BARRY told GRIER that the
party would be leaving the suite and requested that he, GRIER,
escort Mrs. KENNEDY. The party proceeded towards one’
group of elevators on the fifth floor and then towards a
second group and finally the decision was made presumably by
BARRY to take the freight elevator instead of the passenger
‘elevator. GRIER believes that this elevator was chosen since
the passenger elevators were occupied and the freight elevator
could accomodate the members of KENNEDY's party. At this
time the KENNEDY party consisted of fenator KENNEDY, ETHEL
KENNEDY, JESSE UNRUH, RAFER JOHNSON, BILL BARRY, BILL or
FRANK DUTTON (phonetic) and GRIER. “When the elevator doors
opened on the first floor, GRIER recognized that they were
in the kitchen or serving area of the hotel. BARRY was the
first person off the elevator and he was followed by two other
individuals, identities unrecalled, and they in turn were
followed by Senator KENNEDY, Mrs. KENNEDY and GRIER. While



--- Page 15 ---

walking through the kitchen or serving kitchen area en route

to the ballroom, Senator KENNEDY stopped and shook hands with
several kitchen employees. GRIER recalls that he saw five

or six men dressed in white clothing who were presumably
kitchen workers. Members of the KENNEDY party did not notice
that the Senator had stopped and were continuing towards the
ballroom. GRIER immediately told Mrs. KENNEDY that the Senator
had left the group and he walked over to where Senator KENNEDY
was standing to act as his escort. The Senator then turned
away from the kitchen employees and entered the Embassy Ballroom
through the curtains which separate the ballroom from the
kitchen area. Senator KENNEDY immediately went onto the stage.

In reference to the location of the stage and the
manner in which the group went onto the stage, GRIER explained
that the stage was directly in front of the curtains and that
if the stage was viewed from the center of the ballroom,
Senator KENNEDY would have entered the stage on the right side.
Once on the stage, Senator KENNEDY stood behind the podiun,
JESSE UNRUH was standing to his right, Mrs. KENNEDY was standing
to his left and slightly behind him. GRIER was stationed
behind Mrs. KENNEDY and RAFER JOHNSON was standing near the
right side of the stage to prevent additional people from
joining the group.

While Senator KENNEDY was speaking, BILL or FRANK
DUTTON (phonetic) who was one of the Senator's staff members,
told GRIER that Senator KENNEDY would be escorted from the
stage from the left side since preparations had been made for
his movement through the crowd. When Senator KENNEDY finished
speaking, which GRIER recalled was shortly after Midnight,
BARRY and GRIER positioned themselves along side of him.
Everyone on stage was aware the speech had ended and the crowd
began to move toward the left. GRIER told BARRY that the
exet would be from the left side of the stage and BARRY said
no. .At thie time Senator KENNEDY moved to the rear of the
stage possibly at BARRY's suggestion and jumped to the floor.
BARRY remained with Senator KENNEDY and GRIER assisted Mrs. KENNEDY

to the floor. When the group had left the stage, they
walked behind the curtain and proceeded to the right which
was in the direction of the freight elevator which was used
previously. GRIER could not see Senator KENNEDY at this tine
but since the crowd wag moving in that direction he assumed
Senator KENNEDY was in front of him. GRIER was walking with
Mrs. KENNEDY and was acting as her escort. GRIER explained
that regardless of which side of the stage KENNEDY left by

he would still have to follow the original route in order to
reach the elevator.

GRIER walked approximately ten or fifteen feet into
the kitchen area when he heard two or three sounds which
resembled the sounds of firecrackers. He then saw the group
of people in front of him scatter and observed a white male
standing in the opening. There were people on both sides of
this man and people were standing behind him. This individual
was holding a black object in his right hand which resembled
a gun. The man held this object at waist level, his elbow
was bent and his forearm was parallel to the floor. This man
was standing on the floor. After observing this man, GRIER
moved to his right and went behind a piece of kitchen equipment
probably a garbage container. He then walked behind the
container to the opposite end and made his way towards the man
who wag holding the gun. As he approached this individual, he
saw two other men, one of whom was BILL BARRY wrestling with
this individual. The man still had the gun in his right hand
but he was now pushed back onto the top of a raised counter
or table. GRIER observed the gun being Knocked from his hand
onto the table and at this point turned and tried to locate
Senator KENNEDY. When he refocused his attention on the man
who was originally holding the weapon, he noticed that this
person had retrieved his gun and was holding it in his hand.

At this instant GRIER was approximately six feet from him and
noted that the individual's arm was extended outward to the
side with the gun held in the hand. GEORGE PLIMPTON (phonetic)
was now wrestling with this individual and was trying to assist
BILL BARRY in seizing the gun. GRIER approached the group and

-6L


--- Page 17 ---

LA 56-156

shouted "I'll take the zun". He then grabbed the man's
right hand and placed his own hand over the hammer and
around the trigger housing. He twisted the gun from his
hand and gained possession of the weapon. GRIER kept the
gun in his right hand and immediately tightly grasped this
individual around the legs. He recalls that several other
people were holding this man.

Once the above individual was subdued, several
people came up and tried to punch and hit him. GRIER
recalled that he was pushing these other individuals away
and trying to protect his prisoner. While holding this
individual he observed Senator KENNEDY lying on his back on
the floor approximately ten or twelve feet away. GRIER could
see blood on the right side of Senator KENNEDY's head and
it appeared that he wag wounded behind the ear. He could not
observe any other blood on Senator KENNEDY's body. He also
noted that a second white male was also lying on his. back near
Senator KENNEDY and he appeared to be bleeding from the left
side of his head. GRIER noted that Senator KENNEDY 's eyes were
partially open, however, he appeared to be in sh3ck.

GRIER continued to hold his prisoner and the gun un-
til some unrecalled person asked GRIER for the weapon. GRIER
refused to surrender the gun since he did not think it was
safe to give it to anyone at this time. A few moments later
another person told him to give the gun to RAFER JOHNSON.
GRIER handed JOHNSON the gun and maintained his hold on the
man until police officers arrived at the scene. GRIER immediately
surrendered this individual to the police officers.

GRIER did not recall that the individual whom he
disarmed made any statements whatsoever while in his presence.

GRIER described the gun which he seized as being a
dark colored revolver possibly black with a short barrel.
He could not recall the chamber capacity of the revolver
nor did he know the caliber of this weapon. It was GRIER's
impression that this was an old, rather than a new, gun.

~ 62


--- Page 18 ---
TA 56-156

GRIER could not remember how many gun shots he
heard prior to the time he seized the revolver, however, he
is certain that no shots were fired while he was disarming
the assailant.

GRIER stated that he has seen photographs of
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in the newspapers and on television and
is certain that this is the same individual whom he disarmed
and held for the police following the shooting of Senator
KENNEDY on June 5, 1968. ‘

GRIER was questioned as to whether he observed
STRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN in the Ambassador Hotel during the
evening of June 4, 19658 or prior to the shooting and he
said that he had not seen him prior to the time that he
disarmed him. GRIER wag specifically asked whether he
saw SIRHAN in the kitchen or serving kitchen area when Senator
KENNEDY walked from the elevator to the stage and he said he
did not observe him at this time. GRIER was asked whether
he observed anyone run from the serving kitchen after he
first heard the gun shots and he said that he did not recall
anyone leave the area. GRIER was then asked whether he
observed a white female wearing a white dress with pblaék polka
dots in the area when the shooting took place and said that
he did not see such a person.

Senator and Mrs. BEILENSON and Miss BARBARA SHAW, a fellow
staff member. He related that approximately one half hour
subsequent to their arrival they entered the Embassy Room
at approximately the same time that Senator KENNEDY began his
victory speech. He related that, due to the highly crowded

able area to view the departure of Senator KENNEDY and his party.
He advised that they located themselves in a corridor between
the ballroom and the kitchen. TOGIO advised that he was :
standing in a corner with his back to the wall, a table to

he immediately turned to his left and observed what he could
only describe as a "blur of figures", after which more shots
were fired and persons began rushing past him to exit through
the door to his right. He stated that he became concerned
for his personal welfare and jumped beneath the table which
was to his right He advised that, shortly thereafter, the
shots subsided and he removed himself from beneath the

crowd. TOIGO stated that, while standing on the table,

he recalled seeing several person engaged in some type of
struggle to his far left, a man who had been shot in the
head lying on the floor to his immediate left, and
Senator KENNEDY lying on the floor in between He advised
that straight across the room was a man who appeared to

be a newsman who had apparently been shot in his side. He
stated that this person was standing close to Mrs. ETHEL
KENNEDY, who was attempting to reach her husband.

TOIGO stated that, when he got down from the
table, the door to his right had been temporarily closed
by individuals who were attempting to keep others from
entering the room. He stated that, as soon as the door was
reopened, he and Senator BEILENSON departed the room.

TOIGO advised that he had a very vague recollec-~
tion of what he saw at the time the first shots rang out
and that it was impossible for him to relate what he actually
saw other then many persons reacting in a generally confused
manner. He explained that he was unable to furnish a more
detailed account of the incident as it took him completely
by surprise and several seconds had passec before he realized
the full effects of what had transpired.

TOIGO advised that he could not recall any
specific conversations or commands given subsequent to the
shooting other than general commands to “move back". He
stated that he was unable to provide the names of any
additional persons who might possibly have been witnesses
to the above-described occurrence, and reiterated that
the only persons present that he could identify were
Senator KENNEDY, ETHEL KENNEDY, and previously named members
of Senator BEILENSON's party.

TOIGO stated that it was difficult to judge the
size of the crowd in the kitchen area but feels that there
were approximately 40 people present at the time of the shooting.

TOIGO advised that he did not recall seeing a female
dressed in a white dresg with black polka dots in the kitcnen
area, TOEGO added that he did not see SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN
before the shooting or at any time and would not be able to
identify him as the assassin.

JOHN F. McKENNA, JR, G50 SOUTH GRAND AVENUE TELEPHONE

FRANK J. BURNS, JR, : . MADISON 4-G506
ROBERY J. BLAYLOCK LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA 90017 .

My name is Frank J. Burns, Jr. I live at 11713
South Atkinson Avenue, Inglewood, California, telephone
number 756~8023. I am an attorney and my office is
located at 650 South Grand Avenue, Suite 600, Los Angeles
90017, telephone number 624-8506.

On June 4, 1968, I arrived at the Ambassador Hotel
at approximately 7:00 P.M. and went to the Presidential
Suite, which was the headquarters for Speaker Unruh and
the Kennedy Campaign staff. Between then and approximately
11:00 P.M., I was either in the Presidential Suite or
around the corner in the Royal Suite area, which was
occupied by Senator Kennedy and his staff.

At approximately 11:00 P.M. I went downstairs to the
Embassy Room and talked to the various members of the
campaign staff who were manning the anchor desk which was
located to the right rear of the podium, At approximately
11:30 P.M. we decided that it was time for Senator Kennedy
to come down, and I went upstairs to get him. The crowd
was so dense in the Embassy Room, that I went along the
passage way in back of the podium and through the kitchen,
exiting into the lobby near the front desk.

As I reached Senator Kennedy's room, Speaker Unruh
was just coming out. He told me that they had decided
that Senator Kennedy would wait a few more minutes before
coming down, but that he, Speaker Unruh, would go down
and talk to the crowd right away. IZ led Speaker Unruh,
Mrs. Unruh, Jack Crose, Speaker Unruh's. Administrative
Assistant, and perhaps one or two other people down to the
Embassy Room through the route that I had used to go
upstairs.

Speaker Unruh then talked to the crowd for a few
minutes. While Speaker Unruh was talking, he told me
to get the Senator to come down, and I told Jack Crose .
to go upstairs and get him. Stephen Smith, Senator Kennedy's
brother-in-law, was then introduced, and spoke to the crowd.
As he was concluding, Senator Kennedy came into the room
from the door immediately to the left of the podium. Jack
Crose later told me that he had brought the Senator's party
‘down through the kitchen, the same way that we had come
before. He also told me that they had come this way
because Senator Kennedy did not want to try to fight through
the crowd in the Embassy Room.

As Senator Kennedy got on the podium, I was standing
a few'’steps back and to the right of the microphone, and
as the members of his party moved in, I stepped further
back to make way for Mrs. Kennedy and other people that
accompanied him down. During most of his speech I was
standing at the rear of the podium and slightly to the
_xight of Senator Kennedy, near his press secretary, Frank
Mankiewicz. .

A pathway had been cleared to the right of the podium
deading toward the area where the anchor desk was located.
When Senator Kennedy finished speaking, he paused for a
Moment and said a few words to some people near the
microphones, and then started to move to his right toward
the cleared path. I turned to my right and at that time
I heard a voice coming from my left rear saying that the
Senator was going the wrong way, and that he should come
off the rear of the platform. Senator Kennedy turned

‘around and passed directly in ‘front of me, to go off the
rear of the platform. I turned to my left and saw a man
in a tuxedo, holding the curtains back and beckoning to
the Senator to follow him. This man stepped down into the
anteroom and Senator Kennedy followed him. I followed
Senator Kennedy.

The man went out the door at the back of the anteroom,
and turned to the right and headed down the incline with
Senator Kennedy close behind him. When I came out of the
doorway and turned to the right to head down the incline,
the man in the tuxedo leading Senator Kennedy was perhaps
10 feet in front of me and moving quite fast. They passed
into the kitchen through the left hand door which was open.
At about that time I yelled to slow down because they were
getting ahead of everyone, I also started to move faster in
order to catch up with the Senator. During this time I
noticed a number of people in the area, but I am unable to
‘ positively identify any of them. My eyes were constantly
on the Senator as I was trying to attract his attention.

As I passed into the kitchen, it seemed to me that
there were quite a number of people in front of the Senator
and moving generally in the same direction he was. As
Senator Kennedy approached the area of the serving tables,
two people moved toward him. The one nearest the serving
table was very short and the other one was about medium
height. They both appeared to be dressed in white kitchen
jackets. The Senator stopped and turned to his left to
shake hands with them. &£ would judge that he turned _
slightly more than 90° from his original direction of travel.
It was when he stopped.to shake hands that Y caught up with
him and got perhaps a half step in front of him. I also
turned to my left and was facing in the same direction as :
the Senator. It was at this moment that I heard a noisé EAR

- 71 -

sounding like a string of fire crackers going off.

I immediately turned my head to the right. TI
have an impression of people standing there, but I would
not be able to positively identify anyone. The one clear
impression I have is of an extended arm holding a gun.
This arm appeared to be next to the serving table and
,the gun would be about even with the front edge of the
serving table. The arm did not appear to me to belong
to anyone. I immediately glanced to my left toward the
Senator and he was falling backward. He had thrown his
hands up and his body appeared to be spinning to the
left. I looked back toward the gun, and by then the
person holding the gun had stepped forward past the edge
of the serving table so that he was directly in front of
me. He was aiming the gun down toward Senator Kennedy's
falling body, and appeared to be shooting at him. My
impression is that the noise of the gunfire had ceased
by then. , \

This is the first time I recall seeing the person
later identified as Sirhan Sirhan. At that time somebody
grabbed Sirhan from behind. Someone else appeared to
grab his gun arm and I grabbed him from the side. The
struggle then became very confused and we rotated around
several times, moving down the line of the serving counter
in the direction that Senator Kennedy had originally been
traveling. The entire situation was chaotic, and I have
only vague impressions of the people who were wrestling
with the assassinat that time. The next thing TE remember
clearly is Bill Barry coming up and plunging into the knot
of people, yelling for a rope so that we could tie him
up. I remember taking off my belt and handing it to
Barry and bending down to grab the assassin's legs so as
to get him off his feet. I believe that Barry then left
and after further struggle, the assassin was more or
less wrestled onto the top of the serving tables.

During the course of the struggle, my vision had
momentarily come to rest upon the area where Senator
Kennedy had fallen on several occasions. The first time
I noticed, it appeared that he was lying on his back and
no one was near him. The next time I looked I could
hardly see him because there was a dense group of people
-around him and the third time I noticed, the crowd had
been cleared back and he was on his back and someone had
opened the front of his shirt. Everyone was screaming
and yelling for a doctor. : oe

The assassin was being firmly held on the table, and
I let go and ran to the entrance of what I think is called
the Colonial Room to see if either a doctor or the police
. were coming that way. Then J ran into the passage way
between the Colonial Room and the Embassy Room. Some ~
people from the hotel and some uniformed security guards
had blocked off the passage way. I asked someone there
if a doctor, the police and an ambulance had been called.
He assured me that they had, and that they were on their
way. I ran back into the kitchen and as I did, I noticed
that Mrs. Kennedy and Jean Smith were kneeling beside
Senator Kennedy.

I believe I then jumped up on the serving counter to
see where the gun was. A number of people were holding
the assassin, the most prominent being Roosevelt Grier.

I looked down and noticed the gun in Grier's hand, and we
exchanged words to the effect that Grier would\hang onto
the gun. I then jumped off the table and went around to
the other side because it appeared that the people that
had Sirhan's head were trying to pull it off. He was on
his back with his head and upper back off the edge of

the table, and I was afraid they would push down and break
his back. Grier was leaning across his hips holding him
firmly on the table. The only other person that I
remember clearly is someone’ in a tuxedo with blond hair,
who had ahold of the assassin's head. I was trying to
tell them to be careful, but no one. was paying any
attention.

About that time, Jess Unruh jumped up onto the top
of the table and leaned over Sirhan and started yelling
that he should be kept alive because he should stand trial.
Unruh was pulling the people off Sirhan and yelling for
the police. The police came up to us from the direction
where Senator Kennedy was lying. The officers took ahold
of the suspect and handcuffed his hands behind his back.
Roosevelt Grier was bent over crying, and I remember
raising his face up and asking him where the gun was. He
said he had given it to Rafer Johnson. I told this to one
of the officers.

Unruh then jumped off the table and told the officers
to get the suspect out of there before he was killed. I ‘
led the officers into the Colonial Room-through the doors
from the kitchen, and then cut the main.entrance of the

Colonial Room into the lobby. There were five or six
officers with us and I led them through the lobby, down
the stairway and out the main entrance, We were moving
very fast and no one was trying to stop us. As we
started out the main entrance, there was a police car
parked there with its right front door open. There was
quite a crowd of people, particularly to my right hand
side, and when they saw us. coming out with the suspect, they
started screaming and surging forward. The officers
pushed the suspect in the back seat and Unruh jumped in
the front seat and yelled for the officers to get out of

_there. At this time I was struggling with some people by

the right front door of the police car who were trying

to get to the prisoner, so IJ shoved the door shut and the
police car took off,

THANE EUGENE CESAR, 1852 Morley, Simi, California,
was interviewed at his place of employment, Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation, Burbank, California.

CESAR advised he is employed on a part-time basis
by the Ace Guard Service, 8720 Woodley Avenue, Sepulveda,
California. CESAR stated in connection with this employment,
he was assigned as a guard to the Ambassador Hotel on the
evening of June 4, 1988,

CESAR stated he arrived for work at the Ambassador Hotel
that evening at 6:05 p.m. and was assigned to the Embassy
Room for most of the evening. CESAR stated his main function
during the early part of the evening was to patrol the entrance
to the Embassy Room, control drunks, break up fights, and to
keep young children from sneaking into the Embassy Room.

Avout 10:50 p.m. the Embassy Room was becoming so
crowded that CESAR, at the request of the Los Angeles Fire
Department, was assigned to the kitchen area behind the
Embassy Room. CESAR stated his function at that point was
to restrict people from entering the Em assy Room from the
kitchen, allowing admittance only to KENNEDY staff members
and members of the working press. CESAR stated that it was
nearly impossible to control people entering the room since
false press badges and staff buttons were prevalent. CESAR
stated he noticed no one in the kitchen who was not wearing
@ Dusiness suit and noticed no one loitering in a susnicious
manner.

At 11:50 p.m., CESAR was moved to the exit door
leading from the Embassy Room into the sitchen area by FRED A,
MURPHY, Security Guard, Ambassador Hotel. CESAR stated at
this time he was informed by MURPHY the plan was for Senator
KENNEDY to leave the Embassy Room through this door after
making his victory speech and proceed through the kitchen to
the Colonial Room where a press conference was scheduled to be
held. At approximately 12:10 a.m., Senator KENNEDY emerged
from the Embassy Room into the corridor leading to the kitchen;

and CESAR, holding Senator KENNEDY's right arm and holding
the crowd back with his right hand, began to escort the
Senator through the crowd.

As the Senator entered the kitchen from the corridor,
approximately ten feet from a steam table, KENNEDY pulled
loose from CESAR's grasp and proceeded over to shake hands
with a busboy. At this time, CESAR attempted to stay as close
to KENNEDY as possible and at the same time, trying to control
the crowd. As KENNEDY was shaking hands with a busboy, CESAR
looked up and suddenly saw a hand sticking out of the crowd
between two camera men and the hand was holding a gun. CESAR
continued he was blinded by the brilliant lights and could not
see the face of the individual holding the gun. Just as CESAR
started to move to jump on the gun, he saw the red flash come
from the muzzle. At the same time, CESAR was shoved by an
unknown individual, and the next thing he remembered he was
on the floor against the ice machine. CESAR stated he was
approximately four feet from the gun when it went off and that
Senator KENNEDY was approximately two feet from the gun.

CESAR scrambled to his feet, drew his gun, and
moved to the Senator. At this time, CESAR stated there
were several men on top of the assassin trying to get the
gun from his grasp. CESAR stated he took a position next
to the Senator's body to protect him from further attack, and
about three minutes later was given orders by Ambassador
Security :Guard MURPHY to get to the Embassy Room doors
and keep the crowd out. CESAR took his position at the
Embassy Room door inside the Embassy Room and stayed there
until approximately 2:00 a.m. controlling the crowd.

CESAR stated he did not see SIRHAN at all during
the evening and never saw anyone in the kitchen area that
was dressed in anything other than a suit except for one
television employee who turned out to be a delivery man.

CESAR estimated there were approximately fifty
persons in the kitchen area at the time of the shooting.
This included kitchen help, newsmen, and campaign workers.
CESAR ‘recalled the room was in utter confusion but there
appeared to be very little movement of people and he cannot
recall seeing anyone attempting to flee from the room. CHSAR
added he cannot recall seeing any female wearing a white
dress with biack polka dots.

HAROLD L. BURBA, 20503 Osage Avenue, Torrance,
California, (phone 371-2966), advised that he is employed by
the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) and is assigned to
LAFD Headquarters, 217 South Hill Street, where he can be
reached at MA 8-6161, Extension 327.

BURBA advised that he desired to furnish the
following information which is in addition to information
furnished by him on June 6, 1968.

On the night of June 4, 1968, BURBA was on official
duty at the Ambassador Hotel to photograph fire hazards, At
the time BURBA estimates to have been approximately midnight,
he was sitting in the hall which rung along the north side of
the Enbassy Room at which time he observed Senator ROBERT F.
KENNEDY and his parly pass where he was sitting.. They were
walking down the corridor in a westerly direction. ‘The
Senator passed out of BURBA's sight anc he assumed that
KENNEDY entered the Embassy Room. BURBA noted tnat he feels
that he is unable to give an accurate estimate or-the number
of people in the party who passed him, but feels that the
number did not exceed fifteen persons.

As the party passed, BURBA recalls seeing several
stragglers but cannot recall exactly how many, inasmuch as
at that time he did not note each of the individuals following
the party. He does recall, however, seeing one white male
with dark complexion who was among the stragglers. After
viewing the photographs in the "Los Angeles Times" on June 5,
1968, BURBA believes that this particular individual was
SIRHAN BISHARA SIRHAN. When he observed SIRHAN among the
etragglers it was due to the fact that SIRHAN appeared to turn
his head from side to side as if paying unusual attention
to the surroundings. At that time, SIRHAN was carrying a
rolled up poster in both hands. The rolled poster appeared
to be about two feet long and two (2) to three (3) inches in
diameter. BURBA noted that inasmuch as SIRHAN carried the
poster with both hands, he feels that SIRHAN had nothing else
i te atthougn he ts umabte to state asa certain ————_

fact. BURBA pointed out, however, that he feels positive

that had SIRHAN had an object tne size of a hand gun in either
hand, he would surely have noticed it. BURBA also pointed

out that he estimates that when he observed SIRHAN, he was
about thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet away.

BURBA stated that he is unable to say whether or
not SIRHAN was with anybody else, but explained that he does
not have the impression that SIRHAN was accompanied by any
other persons. He feels that he was a single individual with
the group of stragglers. He noted tnat he saw absolutely
nothing to indicate that SIRHAN was with another person.
BURBA further pointed out that this was the only time he
observed SIRHAN during the entire evening.

BURBA explained that he later became aware that
Senator KENNEDY had completed his acceptance speech and left
the Embassy Room through the rear anteroom giving access to
the same corridor he had walked through wnen heading toward
the Embassy Room. He is unable to estimate the time at this
point, although he did become aware that the Senator and
the party were walking eastward along the corridor, and he
became aware that KENNEDY had been shot.

After BURBA becane aware that the Senator had been
shot, he made his way down the hall toward where the shooting
occurred, from his position toward the Colonial Room where
the temporary press room was set up. Although he could not
see Senator KENNEDY, he observed a poster being held in the
air above the crowd as if to prevent its being crushed. He |
noted, however, that although the poster appeared similar, ne
eannot say for sure that it was the same poster which he had
observed earlier in SIRHAN's hands. He also explained that
his view was obstructed and advised that he could not see who
was holding the poster above the crowd.

BURBA concluded by stating that, to the best of his
knowledge, he cannot recall any other event that he observed
which might now be pertinent in view of the current investi-
gation being conducted.

“offices, materials, and campaign pavers. I

I had some conversation this particular morning
with Steve, one of the cleaning crew, for
several minutes and we talked about how dirty
the Hq. had become I had spoken with Steve
previously on one or two occasions.

"Steve was a male caucasian, about 23
or 23 years old 5'5" with his cowboy boots on,
125 to 140 lbs, dark eyes and a pimply complex-
ion. He had black, curley hair, worn long,
dark eyes and wore blue denim shirt and slacks.

"I left campaign Hq. about 11:00 A.M.,
6~-4-68 and eventually got to the Ambassador
Hotel about 3 or 4 P.M. in the afternoon. I
was in the Embassy Room at the time of the
shooting shortly after mid-night but did not
see the actual shooting of Senator Kennedy.

I didn't see Steve of the cleaning crew around
the hotel that afternoon prior to the shooting
or after the shooting. I spent the rest df the
night at the Hotel and saw a picture of Sirhan
Sirhan on TV later Wednesday, since he had been
accused of the shooting. He, Sirhan, didn't
appear to resemble Steve of the cleaning crew
then, but later when I was interviewed by the
Los Angeles Police Dept. and shown three photo-
graphs of the man charged with the shooting of
Senator Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan, I got the
impression that Steve of the cleaning crew at
Campaign Hq and Sirhan were identical.

"During my conversations with Steve,
politics was not discussed and he never conmented
on how he felt about Senator Kennedy. Generally,
Kennedy was well regarded by the campaign workers
but his frequent last minute plan changes irked
some of the workers frequently. Some jealousy
existed between the campaign secretaries and
the Kennedy girls because of things like salaries,"

full time worker at the Campaign Hq. told me

he was on LSD, pep pills and tranquilizers. He
also told me he had offered pills to some of
the Kennedy girls. Some of the precinct chair-
man were unhappy with the Campaign Hq because
they were not getting their fair share of
election materials.

"T do not know the last name of Steve
of the cleaning crew mentioned above. I do not
know the man accused of the shooting, Sirhan
Sirhan, unless he and Steve are determined to
be identical. I do not have any personal
knowledge of the motives for the assassination
of Senator Kennedy.

of this and four other pages, and find it to be
true to best of my knowledge.

televhone 0.X. 5-5406, employed as reporter, photographer
and proofreader for the “Whittier Daily News", 7037 Comstock
Avenue, telephone 0.X, 8-2571, was interviewed at his
residence.

RICH stated that he had previously covered the
KENNEDY campaign at the Biltmore Hotel approximately six
weeks before. He covered this campaign from the time
KENNEDY arrived at the Burbank Airport until the time KENNEDY
made his final speech at the Biltmore Hotel. During this
time he took numerous photographs of KENNEDY and his
campaigners.

On the evening of June 4, 1968, RICH went to the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, arriving at approximately
11:00 p.m. He drove his 1964 Ford Galaxie 500 and was
accompanied by his cousin, WALTER GEORGE RICH, 10812 East
Indiana Street, Whittier, California. He parked his vehicle
on 7th Street béhind the Ambassador Hotel, walked across
the parking lot behind the Ambassador Hotel and entered
the building. They found themselves in the RAFFERTY
campaign area and immediately began to look for the area
where KENNEDY would possibly make an appearance. The first
people they saw were the “Kennedy Girls”. They began to
follow these “Kennedy Girls" and finally arrived at the
Embassy Room.

They arrived at the Embassy Room approximately
45 minutes to an hour before KENNEDY made his speech. The
Embassy Room was very crowded, containing numerous television
cameras, newspaper photographers, campaigners and spectators.
Several reporters were on the stage. One section of the
room located to the righthand side of the stage, was roped
off and appeared to be crowded by KENNEDY supporters. -
RICH went to this area in an effort to locate a ‘Kennedy Girl"
he had met during the previous campaign. He identified this
individual as ROTA HERTZPERG, who lives in West Los Angeles.

To the right and behind the roped off area was
an exit leading to a passageway which appeared to run behind
the stage in the Embassy Room. As he attempted to look
into this passageway, an individual, who apparently was
a KENNEDY campaigner, told him that he was in the way.
RICH left this area; however, before leaving he noticed
that the passageway running to the left apparently led
to a flight of stairs which led to rooms on the floor beneath.
If one went to the right in this passageway, they would enter
a doorway leading into an area, which RICH subsequently
determined was the kitchen. RICH advised that he looked into
this kitchen areaand ‘noticed that there was a small
"anteroom", which one had to go through before entering
the main kitchen area. In this anteroom were several chairs
lining the wall. There were several individuals in this
anteroom and the kitchen area; however, RICH took no
particular notice of any individual. When asked if he had
noticed an individual which he could now identify as SIRHAN
BISHARA SIRHAN, RICH advised that he had not taken notice
of army particular individual who might resemble SIRHAN.

RICH advised he returned to the Embassy Room
and while he was in the Embassy Room KENNEDY came onto
the stage and made a speech. RICH watched the activities
through television monitors and occasionally made an effort
to see the stage through the crowd. Standing nearby was
his cousin WALTER RICH.

Toward what RICH felt was the end of KENNEDY's
speech, WALTER asked him if he was going to give KENNEDY
the pictures he had in a manila envelope. RICH explained
that having previously covered the campaign and taken
numerous photographs of KENNEDY, he had made a packet
of appropriate photographs and‘intended to give them to
the Senator if he had an opportunity. RICH advised WALTER
thathe did intend to give KENNEDY the packet and the two
of them made their way to the passageway behind the stage.
While they were in the passageway, an individual asked them
to get out of the way. The man extended his arms in an
effort to block people from coming into the passageway from
the Embassy Room. RICH and WALTER extended their arms and
helped this individual form a line in front of which KENNEDY
could pass into the kitchen area.

--- Page 48 ---

LA 56-156

RICH stated he saw KENNEDY come down the passageway
toward the kitchen area. At about that time the crowd was pressing
so hard behind him that he was forced into the passageway. He

decided that he would attempt to get into the kitchen area to avoid
' the press of the crowd and as he entered the doorway to the kitchen
he noticed that KENNEDY simultaneously had entered the door into the
anteroom area with him. —

KENNEDY was walking faster than he and passed him
by. RICH called out "Senator Kennedy, Senator Kennedy" and
received no response. He again called to Senator KENNEDY and
at this time the Senator turned his head to look over his right
shoulder. RICH handed the envelope to the Senator saying,
'This is for you'!. KENNEDY took the envelope and kept on
walking toward the main part of the kitchen. RICH turned to
go back the way he had come, at which time he heard three ‘pops!
which sounded like a cap pistol. At almost the same instant
he felt a shove from behind and immediately turned, at which time
he observed a man, whom he later determined to be PAUL SCHRADE,
falling to the floor backwards. He also saw Senator KENNEDY
on the floor and noticed that blood was 'all over the place', :
on the floor, all over PAUL SCHRADE, and in particular under the
head of Senator KENNEDY.

RICH advised he is not sure of exactly what
he saw or heard for a few seconds after that. He definitely
did not see the individual who fired the shots or the
struggle over the gun which he subsequently learned ensued
after the shots were fired.

RICH advised he does not recall hearing other
shots, although he is confident that there were more shots
fired because something prompted him to run. He speculated
that he felt a gun battle was about to ensue and after seeing
KENNEDY on the floor he moved as rapidly as possible toward
the Embassy Room. En route he saw one man sitting on the chair
at the side of the anteroom apparently shot, and while Looking
through the doorway he noticed another man fall as if he had
been shot.

While en route to the doorway he noticed his
cousin coming into the kitchen area; however, he did not know
what his cousin did until he arrived in the vicinity of a wall
outside the kitchen and noticed his cousin was right behind
him.

After about 30 seconds to a minute, he then saw
that Someone waS closing the door to the kitchen and he
immediately moved back into the kitchen area. He climbed
up on a metal-top counter along the wall of the anteroom
in an effort to see what was going on. Also on the counter
was a Negro female whose identity he does not know. RICH
advised he stayed on the counter while KENNEDY was being
removed from the room and observed the pandemonium going on
during the next 45 minutes to an hour. He kept looking
for the envelope he had given to KENNEDY, but did not see
it after he had given it to the Senator.

On the evening of June 4, 1965, he accompanied
his cousin, TIMOTHY PAUL RICH, to the Ambassador Hotel to
observe the activities of the KENNEDY campaign. They
arrived at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 11:00 p.m.

They worked their way into the Embassy Room
where they had determined KENNEDY would possibly make an
appearance sometime during the evening.

While in the Embassy Room, WALTER's cousin, TIMOTHY,
went to the area near the righthand side of the stage in order
to determine where he might be able to get close enough to
Senator KENNEDY to hand him an envelope containing photographs ©
taken by TIMOTHY during KENNEDY's last campaign in California.
While TIMOTHY was gone to this area, WALTER remained in the .
central part of the Embassy Room.

TIMOTHY returned to WALTER shortly before Senator

KENNEDY arrived to make his speech. They both remained

in the Embassy Room where KENNEDY and other members of his
staff made speeches. Shortly before KENNEDY finished his
speech, WALTER asked his cousin if he was going to give
KENNEDY the photographs to which TIMOTHY indicated in the
affirmative and they made their way to a passageway at the
rear of the stage area.

WALTER stated that behind the stage was a hallway.
He did not know where the hallway led? if one went behind
the stage; however, if one went "to the right" they would
enter an area which he subsequently learned was the kitchen.
