Dear Senator Cranston:

The correspondence from Jerome O'Brien, referred
by you to this Department's Office of Congressional
Liaison, has been forwarded to this Division for reply.

Mr. O'Brien apparently requests a reopening of the
investigation of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.
This matter was, to the best of our knowledge, fully
investigated by authorities of the State of California
and Mr. Sirhan was. tried for murder, convicted and
sentenced by @ California court. it would, therefore,
be inappropriate for this Department to comment on the
possibility that all available facts were not disclosed
to the public or brought out at the trial.

We can only suggest that Mr. O'Brien direct his
inquiries to the appropriate authorities of the State

! yr California.

Your enclosure is returned herewith.
Sincerely,
J. STANLEY POTTINGER

Dear Sir:
T am cyping this letter while vatchice Dee 23. fas PM PY cr tes
Snyder from New York. Tom is currently ou WERE OF JUSTICE Mr. Push.
MATL UNIT

Tom's guest, a former New York conrressmm, hos raised a number interesting

points concerning the death of Senator Kennedy. In my opinica “i. Sush

is doing a very poor job in answering Nr. loinstene's (farrive the spel
questions. In fact I would say that he is not answering them, but
rather trying to pass Mr. Loinsteno’ as some Kind of kook or fanatic.
The auestions Mr. Loinstene has raised are ae follows: (1) Sirhante ein
could only fire 8 bullets. 5 bullets struck bystanders, 3 struck the
senator, With the 1 passing through his chest and leaving his body, not
being recovered. The interesting fact is that a ninth tulllet p-ssed
through the senator's raincoat at his shoulder. Also 3 bullet holes vere
found in the ceiling. How could a gun that can only fire 8 bullets make
12 mullet holes? (2) Bullistic experts determined that the run was fired
at a distance of 1 to 2 inches from the senator's head, vet not * of the
eyewitnesses confirms this, Allowing for conflicting reports as is usual,
the closest distance reported was 18 inches. (3) If all the bullets were
fired from the same gun they themselves shculd be the same (markings).
In fact a bullet taken from the senator and one taken from a bystander
are not the same. An added fact is that all of the certriages had © rluss
on them. The manufacturer, Cascade, makes 22 calibur bullets with only
2 rings on them. One of the bullets used as evidence had only 1 ring.

The American people are entitled to the truth! What kind of coverur
has taken place? It is obvious by Mr. Bush's answers that he is hiding

somethings Is it the iruth? 772 y7Te?? 2 with the government of today, it

is most likely, in fact most probablet!!!! Neneseaagy? Pratn? - eedtom?

Kagality? Where?

Attn: Acting Deputy Chief

Dear Mr. Petersen: :
Internal Security Section

In Re: SIRHAN, Sharif Bishara

On April 16, 1973 » you requested that the Department of
Justice be advised whether the Internal Revenue Service had conducted any
electronic surveillance (lawful or unlawful) of the subject named
individual(s) or his (their) premises. You further requested that this reply
include any surveillances where one of the parties may have consented to the
surveillance.

The electronic surveillance files of the Internal Revenue Service are
indexed under the names of individuals who were the subjects of electronic
surveillance, attempted electronic surveillance, or on whom leads were
obtained as a result of electronic surveillance. Only in those instances
where a surveillance was attempted or conducted at premises where the
identity of the individuals surveilled could not be ascertained are our
files indexed by address or other geographical location.

Our files disclose that none of the individuals named above were the
subject of any electronic surveillance conducted by the Intelligence Division.
No conversations in which any of the above participated were intercepted,
overheard, or recorded through electronic surveillance conducted by the
Intelligence Division.
