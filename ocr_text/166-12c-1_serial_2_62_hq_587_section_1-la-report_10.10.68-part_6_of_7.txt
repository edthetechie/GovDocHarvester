Records to confirm the employment of DONALD

a Social Security number had been obtained on him.

Mr. STAN CUPPETT, also known as Bob Cuppett,
a waiter employed at the Stuft Shirt Restaurant, 901 East
Del Mar Street, Pasadena, California, advised the following:

CUPPETT said he recalled DONALD EVANGELISTA, who
was employed as a waiter at the Stuft Shirt Restaurant for
several months, which would have been about 1965 or 1966.
While here, he married a girl who reportedly was from Colombia,
South America. EVANGELISTA left quite suddenly when he
found out that some representative of gq ° Federal agency,
believed to be possibly with the FBI, had made inquiry at
the restaurant concerning EVANGELISTA. The latter reportedly
went to Colombia.

EVANGELISTA showed up at the restaurant three or
four months ago, said "Hello," and claimed to have been
back East. EVANGELISTA had been a member of Waiters Local
531 in Pasadena and Waiters Local 17 in Los Angeles, and
it was possible that these organizations may have a current
address on EVANGELISTA.

While working at the Stuft Shirt, EVANGELISTA was
a personable young man and was well liked. CUPPETT did not’
know why EVANGELISTA left suddenly without notice,

EVANGELISTA was described as being a male
Caucasian, about 25 years of age, 518", 130 pounds, wavy
light brown hair, medium complexion, of possible Italian
descent. He originally claimed to have resided in Massachusetts.

She and her husband have lived at the above address
for the past ten years. Mr. OSUNA is employed in the Mainte-
nance Department of Libby, McNeil and Libby, Sunnyvale,
California, where he has worked for the past ten years.

OLGA OLVERA OSUNA is their daughter, who is
married to ROBERT KESSLER and lives at 906 Iris,Sunnyvale.
She knows no one named BOB ROBERTO MERCURY and her daughter
is not known by the name of OLGA OLVERA OSUNA DE MERCURY.

Mrs. OSUNA was shown a copy of a document containing
the above names, as well as the name. of ROBERT KENNEDY, and
the address 2127 Estanford Avenue, Mountain View, California.
She identified the handwriting on this document as being that
of her sister, ROSARIO OLVERA DE INFANTE, age 48. She eaid her
sister is mentally unbalanced and should be in an institution
for the insane. She is the wife of QUIRINO INFANTE, P. 0.

Box 753, Walnut Grove, California; however, she has run away
from him and her present whereabouts are enknown. She was in
a mental hospital in Stockton, California, for about two years,
but was released a year or two ago. This hospital is located
at 510 E. Magnolia Street, Stockton, California.

Since her. release she has written many letters to
all the members of the family accusing them of crimes and
saying derogatory things about them. These letters come from
all over the United States. Her husband does not know where
she is, as she left him several months ago and has not been
heard from since.

Her sister knows that OLGA OLVERA OSUNA is the
daughter of FEDERICO and RUTILIA OSUMNA, but she does not know
the last name of her husband or their address. OLGA'’s husband,
who is named ROBERT, used to have a Mercury automcbile, and

She knows that ROBERT KESSLER and OLGA were in

She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. FEDERICO OSUNA,
2127 Stanford Avenue, Mountain View. Her husband is employed
by Edelweiss Dairy, Santa Clara, California.

Her mother’s sister, ROSARIO OLVERA DE INFANTE, is
a mental case, and has been mentally unbalanced for many
years. She is married to QUIRINO INFANTE, Walnut Grove,
California, but he does not know where she is and she has
-abandoned him.

ROSARIO despises her entire family and is constantly
writing letters to them containing accusations and insults.
These letters come from many different places. ROSARIO
knows she is married, but does not know her husband's last
name or their current address. If ROSARIO used the name
MERCURY in a communication, it must have been because OLGA‘s
husband formerly owned a Mercury automobile and she identified
him by this means.

Neither she nor her husband had any connection with
the killing of ROBERT KENNEDY, both of them being at home
on the night he was. killed.

Apartment C, Orange, California, phone 627-1659, in an
attempt to locate her husband. She was advised that her
husband was reported to have made some statements concerning
the assassination of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

Mrs. MC CARTHY stated that she is thoroughly
confused over the whole situation. She stated she was not
sure of the facts, but she recalled that her husband had
mentioned that he had met a man,in a car she thought, who
stated that if KENNEDY were to become President, or even
before that, he would be killed. She further stated that her
husband seemed very nervous after he heard an announcement,
over the radio after the assassination,in connection with
a reported diary which had been found. It belonged to
SIRHAN SIRHAN and mentioned a particular name which her
husband thought might have some connection with the
conversation he heard. He said he was surprised to meet
this man, but the man said he had a very important engagement
on the day after KENNEDY was killed so that he could not do
what her husband had asked him to do.

Mrs. MC CARTHY explained that her husband had
mentioned this information to his employer,at J.K.I. Investigations,
and his employer had indicated he would contact a lawyer and
tell him what the circumstarnfes were, and if he thought it was
of importance, the lawyer could call JOHN MC CARTHY and then
JOHN could tell the FBI about it. She explained that she
knew that the FBI would get a great number of calls regarding
the assassination, and since they were not sure the incident
had any connection with the assassination, they did not want
to bother the FBI unless it looked as if it would be very
important.

. JOHN FRANCIS MC CARTHY was
contacted at Mac Arthur Boulevard and Campus Drive in
Costa Mesa, after having made an appointment .
telephonically on the evening of June 25, 19638.

He was advised that he was being contacted in
connection with information regarding the assassination of
Senator ROBERT F, KENNEDY which he reportedly had in his
possession.

MC CARTHY explained that he had been working for
J.K.I Jnvestigations, 190 North Orange, Orange, California,
as an investigator in June 1968, but he is no longer employed
there because of a reduction in force. In connection with a
case to which he was assigned, he had to contact CLIFFORD
DANIEL GRESHAM, 12319 East Baldwin, Orange, California, in
connection with a compensation case. GRESHAM had had an
alleged injury and was receiving compensation, and he,
MC CARTHY, was attempting to ascertain if GRESHAM was
seriously injured. He stated he contacted GRESHAM at his
residence, which was for sale, and in the course of their
conversation, he asked MC CARTHY if he would be able to help
him in doing some work cleaning up some property. GRESHAM |
‘indicated that he could not. The first contact with GRESHAM
was on May 29, 1968, at which time they talked about the
coming election, and the subject of Senator KENNEDY came up.
MC CARTHY alleged that GRESHAM stated, "KENNEDY, that bastard,
I wouldn't vote for him." He further stated something to the
effect that if KENNEDY were to be elected President, he would
probably be shot like his brother, and he added, “You know why,
because of his support of Israel. He wanted to send arms to
the damn Jews."

MC CARTHY stated that he recontacted GRESHAM on
June 3, 1968, and tried to make an appointment with him on
Wednesday, June 5, 1963, but he stated that he had a very
important engagement and would not be able to make it on that
date. MC CARTHY explained that it was in the early morning
hours of that day that Senator KENNEDY had been shot, and

after thinking about his statement, he wondered why GRESHAM
would not be able to meet him. He further stated that after
hearing a broadcast concerning SIRHAN SIRHAN's diary which
had mentioned the name GOLDBERG, he recalled that GRESHAM
had also mentioned the name GOLDBERG, but he could not recall
in what connecticn.

MC CARTHY stated that he told his boss, JAY KUDE,
about the conversation, and KUDE indicated he had a friend
who was an assistant to Chief THOMAS J. REDDIN of the
Los Angeles Police Department, and he, KUDE, would think it
over, and if it looked like it was important, he would tell
this man at the Los Angeles Police Department.

MC CARTHY explained that on June 9, 1968, he and
GRESHAM had about a two hour conversation at GRESHAM's
house, and GRESHAM stated he had been thinking a lot about
the assassination, and it was bad. He further stated that
it might happen again, and a good place would be Chicago,
the city of violence. GRESHAM stated that he heard later
that someone had been murdered in Chicago, and he wondered
about GRESHAM's statements, MC CARTHY said that there is
always TED KENNEDY who is teft, and GRESHAM stated that he
will probably "get it too." MG CARTHY stated that the man
had not been drinking, because he does not drink, and he made
no mention of Jordanians and indicated no comnection with any
Jordanians.

MC CARTHY said that he is not sure whether his boss
actually told thé man at the Los. Angeles Police Department
about the above informatioh.

MC CARTHY described GRESHAM as about 61, white

male, about 5!10", 165 pounds, medium build, prown-gray

by his company for about 45 days.

He stated that after the assassination of Senator
ROBERT F,. KENNEDY, MC CARTHY had related conversations,
which MC CARTHY stated he had had with CLIFFORD DANIEL
GRESHAM of Orange, California. He recalled that MC CARTHY
had said that GRESHAM had made derogatory remarks about
Senator KENNEDY and had called him a "bastard" and had
stated that if KENNEDY were to be elected, he may be shot.
He further stated something to the effect, "I will tell you
why --- because of his stand with the Arabs and the Jews,
because he wants to ship arms to the Jews."

After hearing the allegation, KUDE stated that
on about dune 13, 1968, he reported this information to
Officer BOB GRAY, who is an aideto Chief THOMAS REDDIN of
the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). He explained
that GRESHAM is a high school friend of his and after he
reported it to GRAY, GRAY said that he would turn the
information over to the LAPD Task Force handling the
assassination investigation. KUDE further stated that
later an Officer THOMPSON of the LAPD called him and
obtained the information from hin.

When KUDE was asked concerning the reliability
of MC CARTHY, KUDE stated that he had a high opinion of
his reliability. He stated that his work was satisfactory,
to a certain extent, but he was not experienced, and he had
made some errors of judgment on some occasions. He stated
that he had not indicated to MC CARTHY that he would possibly
be terminated prior to the time that Senator KENNEDY was
assassinated, He stated he could think.of no reason
why MC CARTHY would make up a story about alleged statements

When advised that GRESHAM had denied the allegations
made by MC CARTHY and that GRESHAM is a registered Democrat,
who stated he had voted for Senator KENNEDY in the primary

by his wife, KUDE stated that GRESHAM could have been a
"sleeper" and could have registered as a Democrat for a
cover if the assassination was a conspiracy.

KUDE pointed out that both GRESHAM and STRHAN
had had industrial injuries and that apparently SIRHAN
SIRHAN had had an injury in connection with horse training
for REX ELLSWORTH. He stated that he would like to know
if there were any connections between the legal representation
