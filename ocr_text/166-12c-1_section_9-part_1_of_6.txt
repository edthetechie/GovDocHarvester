Mrs. J. Keller
Everett, Washington 98206

Dear Mrs. Keller:

Your letter to Vice President Mondale concerning
the re-opening of the’Robert Kennedy Assassination investigation
has been referred to me.

As you may know, the assassination of Senator
Robert F. Kennedy was a state, rather than a Federal crime,
and its investigation and the prosecution of Sirhan Sirhan
was the responsibility of California authorities. Subsequent
to Senator Kennedy's assassination, Public Law 91-644 was
passed making it a Federal crime to kill, kidnap, or assault
a member of Congress. That law now appears at 18 U.S.C.
351.

Therefore, although we appreciate the interest of
concerned citizens, such as yourself, no member of the
Federal Executive Branch may be of assistance in this matter
unless there is credible evidence that Federal laws in
effect at the time of the assassination were violated.

Sincerely,

Philip B. Heymann
Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division

Kennedy assassination case have been forwarded to the Department of Justice
apparently after having been reviewed and analyzed by the U.S. Attorney's ‘

staff out here-

We call spec.

We can only assume that this material would not have been fo: ed
to higher authority were it not worthy of further consideration. mtghe we

also note that the U-S- Attorney does not reject the jurisdiction of this

matter under any civil rights statutes, as per the citing from your office
by David B. Adler in his letter to us of April 6, 1979.

Dear Ms Ordin:

Several months ago we had hand-delivered to you an advance (gal
copy of our just-released book on the Robert F. Kennedy soeacs ination save.
In a covering letter, we made note that there might be danger in store for
a good many “prospective witnesses" identified in this case via our book
Such may now have occurred. : ,

Enclosed is a jetter to the Pomona Police Department reiating to some
recent events concerning the members of the Johnny Gray family, some of who
have now provided us with additional information over and above that previously
known and described in our book; it is our firm opinion that the lives of one
or more of these witnesses could be in immediate danger.

we ask that you take immediate steps to protect the lives of all members
of the Gray family in cooperation with the Pomona police authorities.

As previously Stated. Me stand ready to assist your office in any way
useful; however, we are Slightly disturbed that we have yet to receive any
kind of response from you about the contents and contentions of our book.

If you do not take our appeal seriously, please notify us as such and

we shall seek other intervention. However, it is our best opinion that your
office has primary responsibility at this juncture.

Dear Ms Ordin:

Enclosed is recently developed information on the Robert Kennedy assassination
that should be of particular interest to your office as you continue your review ‘of
our findings (as per Paul G. Flynn's letter to us of November 22, 1978),

We submit this additional data because we're sure it carries with it implications
beyond our original discoveries.

The firmly stated position of the 1978-79 Los Angeles County Grand Jury (Foreman)
Would seem to automatically place the entire burden on your office for the Proper and
Prompt handling of this matter; and rightfully so, perhaps, as the issues at hand have
National ramifications. ;

It. is our belief that because of the longtime, ongoing "political" relationships
and interactions by many of those we identify as embroited in “consodiracy and cover-up,"
this matter presents formidable problems to any agency of government; however, your
Office is uniquely required and obligated to set aside any such considerations, which
we trust can be done without further delaying an appropriate resolution.

We're not trying to unfairly position nor pressure you in this issue; however,
with the Presidential election of 1980 fast approaching, the need to ascertain whether

Perative.

Dear Mr. Flynn:

Last November 22nd you notified us that your office was looking into
the so-called "allegations" contained in our recent book on the Robert F.
Kennedy assassination case; these specifically related to evidence showing
that. a conspiracy and a cover-up were involved in the RFK assassination.

You also stated that you would be "in contact" with us after reviewing
our findings; surely five months has been enough for you to determine the
viability of this evidential information.

If you reject our findings, we should like to know the snecifics on
which you have based that determination; however, if you agree with us and
a good many others so exposed to this evidence, then we should like to know
the status and disposition of this matter as it now stands within your office.
We believe we are entitled to this information as professional men and as
concerned citizens of this nation, and for its future.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

By now members of your office should have reported to you on the
contents of our recently-released book, THE ASSASSINATION OF ROBERT F.
KENNEDY -7_A Searching Look at the Conspiracy and Cover-up -~ 1968-1978.
If not, we should be ready to Supply you with a copy on request.

As per the enclosed letters, we have long sought the involvement
of federal law enforcement in this case; not only for the sake of a long-
overdue justice, but because there are lives in jeopardy in this case at
this juncture, our own included.

Certainly your recent exposure to certain clements within the highest
levels of law enforcement in California should point out the ~eality of our
contentions here; we're convinced that our book reflects the extremes of

this situation as it has existed now for more BO. of, oe : /

—_

We are cqually convinced that a failure to com zps‘with the
facts behind the conspiracy and cover-up in the RFK dz could well place
the lives of the President, Vice President and other |prominent government
officials in serious jeopardy; the element we identity as inVolvéd if7@he
RFK assassination is lethal, indeed, and is quite vocal in its irrational
challenge of the current Administration's foreign and domestic policies.

Dear Mr, Governor:

We wish to thank Mr, Lowenstein for presenting you with a prepublication
copy of our forthcoming book from Random House, "THE ASSASSINATION OF ROBERT F.
KENNEDY -- A Searching Look at the Conspiracy and Cover-up -- 1968-1978." The
book is to be released by our publisher on or before September Ist.

The title of our book is quite reflective of its contents; while it is most
contrary to what you've been told before by involved law enforcement officials,
we respectfully request, that you personally examine our evidence and then re-
evaluate your position,

If you find that our book contains sufficient information to support its
central theme, then we'urge you to use the complete powers vested within your
office to see that this case receives an appropriate review at the earliest
possible moment; we are asking the same of several other government officials,
who will be receiving copies of the book momentarily.

We trust that you will understand the portent of this issue if left to being
unresolved any further; and we also ask for your assistance in providing for the
safety of the many witnesses named within the pages of our book, ourselves in-
cluded; you may contact us through our counsel in this matter, Hr. Vincent T.

We trust this has been done.

In our covering letter of dune 21, we pointed out that there would be a possible
threat to the safety of witnesses to elements of the conspiracy and cover-up in this
case once the book was released to the public; such seems now to have happened to the
entire family of some crucial witnesses.

We urgently request that you assign someone on your staff to make contact with
us at the above address as soon as possible, to see what might be done to afford the
requisite security demanded in this situation.

Dear Officer Herring:

Pursuant to our phone conversation this morning at the home of Mrs.
Louise Gray of your city:

We trust that a review of our book on the Robert F. Kennedy assassination
will assist your department in assessing the events of the recent past around
the Gray home; certainly formal statements should be taken from all members of
the Gray family as they relate to their individual and collective recollections
of relevant incidents and events; this we have done ourselves over the last two
weeks; we should be happy to assist you in any way useful, of course.

It is because of the history of the RFK case in the hands of Los Angeles
(and subsequent State) law enforcement officials that we have deemed it necessary
to seek the intervention of higher governmental authority, especially at the
Federal levels of government; we urge that you do the same if you think the
-information developed by your investigators so warrants.

It is our opinion that the lives of many innocent persons could be at stake
in this matter; thus, we ask that your department take the affair seriously and
act with all due urgency. :

Thanks for your attention and concern.

JGC/WWT: jah Very sincerely,

Dear Ms Ordin:

Several months ago we had hand-delivered to you an advance (galleys)
copy of our just-released book on the Robert F. Kennedy assassination case.
In a covering letter, we made note that there might be danger in store for
a good many “prospective witnesses" identified in this case via our book.
Such may now have occurred.

Enclosed is a letter to the Pomona Police Department relating to some
recent events concerning the members of the Johnny Gray family, some of who
have now provided us with additional information over and above that previously
known and described in our book; it is our firm opinion that the lives of one
or more of these witnesses could be in immediate danger.

We ask that you take immediate steps to protect the lives of all members
of the Gray family in cooperation with the Pomona police authorities.

As previously stated, we stand ready to assist your office in any way
useful; however, we are slightly disturbed that we have yet to receive any
kind of response from you about the contents and contentions of our book.

If you do not take our appeal seriously, please notify us as such and
we shall seek other intervention. However, it is our best opinion that your
office has primary responsibility at this juncture.

JGC/WWT: jah Very sincerely,

Dear Mr. Joling:
Your letter of Auguat 30, 1977, to Mr. Barry Jagoda,

expressing your view that the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy
was the victim of a conspiracy, was referred. to the Criminal

Division for consideration and reply,

AK
ofA?

We are of course aware that net all forensida scientists
are in agreement as to the evaluation of the physical evi-
dence found at the scene of the assassination and the con-
clusions to be drawn therefrom. Minor discrepancies are
also present in other evidence relating to the event. How-
ever, after giving full consideration to the foregoing,
in our view, the evidence that Sirhan Sirhan acted alone in
the assassination remains compelling.

Aa all logical investigation of the matter has been
completed, we see no useful purpose in repetition thereof.
You suggested that failure to reply to a letter of May 17,
1977, from you to President Carter on this subject carries
serious implications. That and even the delay in this re-
sponse certainly evidence some inefficiency in our bureau-
eracy, for which we duly apologize, though instances of this
nature have plagued the citizenry from time immemorial. In
any event, such a failure is scant evidence of any nefarious
scheme, and we must disagree most forcefully that any such

In summary, while we appreciate your concern and your

‘nothing further to be done with respect thereto.

Re: Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Investigation
Dear Mr. Jagoda:

Mr. Michael Ellard of United Press International recently
has forwarded the correspondence he has had with you.
This was sent to me for my personal edification.

On May 17, 1977, I addressed a letter to President Carter
relative to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination matter.

I forwarded this to President Carter from Los Angeles,
California. Unfortunately, I have not yet received a
response to said correspondence. As a result I continue
to grow more apprehensive day by day. It now appears that
non-involvement at the highest level of government and
avoidance of the implications embodied within this matter
will continue.

The present status of the efforts in the case of the
assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy strongly indi-
cates that there may well have been a conspiracy of some
dimension involved in the taking of the Senator's life
which may concomitantly involve an official cover-up
continuing in effect to this very day on a very broad scale.
Most ominous of all if, indeed, conspirators involved in
the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy walk the
streets as free men, those of political persuasion entirely
inimicable to that of President Carter or Vice President
Mondale might again attempt such a dastardly deed.

I respectfully request that you, personally, follow up on
my earlier letter to the President. If desired, I would

be most happy to meet with Attorney General Bell at which
time, I am sure, my contentions could be aptly demonstrated
to his complete satisfaction.

Mr. Jimmy Carter ,

President of the United States
of America

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington D. C.

Dear Mr. President:

Last week during your television appearance here in Los Angeles,
I was one of those selected to ask questions. Unfortunately,
however, time ran out before my turn arrived, although CBS TV
had me ask my question after you had left the studio.

Enclosed is a Los Angeles Times story that appeared May 19,
1977, that encompasses the above. My question deals with an
issue that has been on the minds of most Americans for a long
time: The assassinations of the past decade and a half.

Recently the former special counsel of the House Committee on
Assassinations, Mr. Richard Sprague strongly recommended that
you intercede in this issue by appointing a special prosecutor

as in the Watergate affair. He suggested that the House is

too "political" a body, but more importantly, the House is not
capable of handling matters involving criminal investigations.

I am reliably informed that the House does not have the authority
to either indict or, convict anyone.

Assuming Mr. Sprague's viewpoint is correct, it only seems
logical and proper that the President of the United States of
America take charge of this matter as soon as possible. It

was my impression that you shared the American people's concern
in this issue during your campaigning out here in 1975.


--- Page 35 ---
“continued " -~2- @ aoe

As a working news photographer, I have recently been provided
with substantial information relating to a possible conspiracy
in the Robert F. Kennedy assassination. Ironically, some of
this same evidence was being presented before the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors during your television appearance,
some of which we used in wirephotos that night. We also obtained
a copy of the letter sent to you on this subject by Dr. Robert
J. Joling, the past President of the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences. It was Dr. Joling and former Congressman
Allard K. Lowenstein who presented this new evidence before the
Board of Supervisors on May 17th.

It seems to me that these two men of high reputation should be
listened to on this matter. I should like to know if you share
the vast majority of Americans' concern on the assassination
issue, and if so, whether or not you plan to confront it in the
near future. If I personaly can be of any help whatsoever please
feel free to contact me, I owe it to myself, my profession, and
my country. .

Respectfully’ yoyrs

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS :

I began my researgh at The John F. Kennedy Library in
Waltham, Massachusetts with a limited knowledge of” my subject
matter and an-even more infintestimal understanding of a
presidential library. Thanks to the indefatiguable assistance
of Will Johnson, Joan Hoopes, and the entire Kennedy research
staff, I was able to afford a more comprehensive appreciation
for both my subject matter and the innerworkings of such a
resourceful institution as the Kennedy Library.

Will Johnson directed my research toward the oral history
transcripts, the prepresidential paper; the Democratic National
Committee papers, the memorandums, letters and correspondences,
which constitud the bulwark of this thesis. For his assistance,
I am hereby appreciative. .

The research was also the product of a beneficial relation-
ship between Professor Foley and myself. His advice on attaching
the thesis, our weekly meetings, and continuous supervision,
made my research effort more comprehensive and easier to pre-
pare. I am quite grateful for this assistance.

On a lighter note, I would like to thank the MBTA for
providing transportation to the library. Though they left me
a mile away, I still would not have been able to accomplish my
research goals without, their trolleys and buses. They were
reasonably efficient though perhaps a more direct route to

the library could be established.

FOREWORD:

This thesis contains manifold objectives: the effect of
the Catholicism issue in the West Virginia primary of 1960,
the political organization to combat it, the issue's effect in
the general election as well as other aspects of the primary
which relate to the Catholicism issue.

I have included in my research other dimensions of the
primary which -provide the reader with a sensible overview of
the climate of opinion in West Virginia. These aspects include
Senator Hubert Humphrey's challenge, the Kennedyesque charisma [ole
which propagated his political organization, the basic objections
levied against a Catholic President, and other aspects pertinent
to a discussion of this main issue.

I have substantially used the oral history interviews to
demonstrate both the political effectiveness of the kennedy
organizational forces and the pressures suffered by Kennedy
supporters due to the religious factor. In an effort to supple-
ment these interviews, I have used the Democratic National
Committee papers, the pre-presidential papers and other sources

to broaden the scope of this research.

when senator John Fitzgerald sennedy began his quest for
the presidency at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, he Jw
was well aware of the:>tension surrounding his religious affil-

lation. He could recite history in support of his concern;

the 1928 Presidential election witnessed a wave of anti-Catholi got sete
sentiment against Democratic nominee Alfred Smith, which along
with other prevailing issues of the 1920's, resulted in his
defeat. Kennedy was determined to confront this issue of
religion in the primaries of the 1960 campaign and he chose

the West Virginia primary as his proving ground to negate the
issue from the public limelight.

Yet Kennedy could be encouraged by the change in voting
patterns since 1928. Two “important changes" are seen by Sam-
uel Lubell, an experienced writer on politics, since the spect-
acular election of 1928: "First, fairly large number of Cath-
olics have been voting Republican in recent years-- which of ole
course, means there are more voters who could be won over by

a Catholic Democrat... The second change from 1928 is that the
Democratic party now exerts a far stronger economic appeal to
non-Catholic workers and farmers."

There existed a definite trend toward the relaxing of
the religious question. In fact, late in 1959, 69% of a sample
of voters stated that they would be willing to vote for a well-
qualified candidate for President who happened to be a Roman
Catholic, compared with 62% of a sample in 1940, according to
a report dated December 8, 1959, by George Gallup, director of

1- Report, "Bureau of Research and Survey, National Council
of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America,"
May 23, 1959, p.6.

the American Institute of Public Opinion in Princeton, New
Jersey.” Elmo Roper, also a well-known student of public
Opinion, wrote a guest editorial in the Saturday Review, New
York, October 31, 1959, asking the question, "how many (voters) ot _
would actually forsake the party of their choice to vote against qu °
a Catholic?" Mr. Roper answers: "One can only estimate-- my a
own estimate is from 6 to 8 per-cent.*3 Though the trend
looks toward Kennedy's favor, the issue of religion is still
disturbing to a substantial amount of voters.
Kennedy entered the West Virginia primary warned of the
95% Protestant constituency, but nevertheless eager for the
challenge. A Harris poll conducted in December, 1959, just
four months before the primary, gave Kennedy a 70-30 margin over

his main rival, Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota. Yet

this poll was taken before the news of Kennedy's Catholicism

was established.

The platform on which West Virginia politics are shaped
is a buldge on the inner slope of the Appalachians, 24,282
square miles in extent (forty-first state in the union in size)
on which dwell 1,850,000 people. Theodore white explains the
political theater on which sennedy was to campaign: "if one were
to choose those states whose politics (excluding the baroque
courthouse states of the South) are the most squalid, corrupt
and despicable, then one would add West Virginia to that Jukes \o"
family of American politics that included Indiana, Massachusetts

4

and Texas."

Intially, it appeared that Humprey would prove to be a
formidable opponent. Though Kennedy had earlier defeated
him in his backyard, Wisconsin, the United Mineworkers, the
big labor union in West Virginia, had strongly endorsed Humphrey
in retaliation for Bobby and Jack's work on the WeClellan .
committee. Interestingly, Kennedy won the labor vote in the
primary.
Robert Kennedy suggested to his brother that the only way
to avoid an ugly religious brawl was 5 to ask Humphrey to with-
draw. If Humphrey. continued and won, he would be charged with
stirring up a revival of 1928 bigotry and denounced as a tool
of the anti- Catholics. That would finish him as a crusading ©
liberal and damage the Democratic party. “Humphrey, fearful ,;
of appearing as a Kennedy.tool, resisted. . a jo
ginia. As Ken O'Donnell, his campaign aide explains, “Aside
“from the challenge of the religious issue, the primary in West
Virginia became such a blatantly open effort on the part of all

the other contenders to stop Kennedy that Jack's aroused Irish

temper made him eager to plunge into it."5 Inspite of his

father's advice, Kennedy never thought of retreating from the rip
&
West Virginia challenge. td
The attack on Humphrey as a straw candidate (Humphrey nad! ae 7
A

no actual chance of winning the nomination but served as a pawn
for the stop-Kenmnedy movement) appealed to the west Virginians’
strong sense of fair play, and built up an attractive image of

--- Page 46 ---
fcennedy as the one and only genuine contender for the Presi-
dential nomination who was concerned eriough about the state
and its unemployment problems to’ become involved in its primary.

Joseph Rauh, the chief Humphrey co-ordinator in the pri-
maries explained the Hufiphrey strategy i "We considered ourselves
the favorites in the next two primaries. (District of Columbia
and West Virginia) The question that you couldn't debate that
night was what good would:it have done. to win the next two.
It would have killed Jack Kennedy, but it wouldn't have elected
Hubert Humphrey. As you look back, if we couldn't carry Wis-
consin, we couldn't nominate him. It was a kind of feeling
that when you get one blow, you go back for another. Therefore,
it was unanimous there to go on (there referring to a meeting
in Wisconsin) except, in my recollection, for a discussion on V
finances-- and on finances the talk was not in the sense ‘Let's gor?
give up,” but in the sense of, "Oh G-d, what are we going to quate!
do?' 0 .
There was some mention during the West Virginia primary
of financial inequities on the part of the Kennedy campaign
effort. Rauh also addresses this issue: "The Humphrey camp
thought the Kennedy camp was giving the West Virginia political
leaders in the different areas funds. Now I understand it's a
practice in West Virginia to give funds to political leaders,
which they in turn use for poll watchers and so forth, and that
is not, in fact, dishonest. Whether it is or it isn't, it was

jo

our feeling that large sums wére going to these leaders."

23, 1965, p.58, John F. Kennedy Library Oral History Program.

Rauh has laid to rest the allegation that the Kennedy family
had bought the West Virginia primary. It was a gross mis-
conception of the complex political organization that sennedy
had created. And Rauh, leader of the opposition force, con-
cedes that this allegation was false and inaccurate.

kennedy had many advantages at the outset of the primary.
Interestingly, his Harvard accent and urbane, sophisticated
charm was wondrously accepted by the conservative, West Virginia
voter. His appeal was not unlike that of Franklin Roosevelt
and many voters, appreciative of the Roosevelt effort during
the depression, graciously accepted Kennedy. This is apparent
in an interview with a kennedy campaign worker, Bob Iiyers, who

reflected upon this image:

Young: What was the reaction of the West

Virginians that you were with to the Harvard

accent and the Eastern airs? Did you find

any resentment of this in West Virginia or

was he accepted as simply being a little

bit different but nevertheless a good guy?

Myers: Well, I think without question the

Harvard accent was an asset. o#w

Young: This, too, brought memories of _
Franklin Roosevelt? yor
Myers: Yes. And well, maybe this again is “|

a personal opinion, but I always feel that
the outstanding public speaker is a man
with... his voice can be distinctive on the
radio, for example, as opposed to someone
else's. I think the Harvard accent was was
not resented to any extent at all and, in

fact, it became a tremendous asset to him. ©

In order to perpetuate this Rooseveltian glamour and image,

sennedy employed the assistance of Pranklin Roosevelt Jr. as

part of the Kennedy organizational effort ‘in West) Virginia.

This connection proved to be overwhelmingly effective in Kennedy's
campaign.

Yet the religious factor was not to be overlooked in West
Virginia. This was xennedy's opportunity to confront and defeat
the issue. Kennedy decided on a strategy for meeting the rel-
igious issue in West Virginia and the nation. He would reassert

his independence of ecclesiastical pressure as often as was necc-

essary and attempt to stigmatize as bigots those who remained

opposed to him on religious grounds only. His first task would

be to make éléar His independence, his second, to put the haters
on the defensive.

In a letter from Robert McDonough to Senator Kennedy, on
May 19,1958, McDonough first points out the religious "problem"
and the difficulty in organizing support in West Virginia due to
Kennedy's Catholicism. McDonough's suggestion was simple: "I
know of only one way to combat this-- personal contact and the
impression therefrom."

The Kennedy organizational team, spearheaded by McDonough,
Ted Sorenson and Ralph Dungan, confronted the issue with seven

basic approaches as:.a response to this "problem" in West Virginia:

(1) National statement by prominent clergy
deploring issue-- mail to every West Vir-
ginia Protestant minister (from. them, not
Kennedy office)

(4) JFK TV appeal on religious issue as
well as newspaper ads.
(7) JFK letter to every registered Demo-

The following reccommendations were made by Sorenson and Dun-
gan: on approaches 1,2,3,7-- definitely yes; on approach 5--
yes, wherever local people feel it would help; on approach 6--
last week if seems neccessary; on approach 4,- definitely no,
too much like the hate-group approach, 21

As can be witnessed by the aforementioned memorandum,
Kennedy enjoyed a highly-polished organizational mechanism, ok.
directed by such loyal politicos as Theodore Sorenson, Ralph
Dungan and Lawrence O'Brien, as well as a pighly-developea
contingency of local politicians; its network of operations
reaching all the major voting districts in West Virginia. These
local politicians, organized by McDonough, dedicated themselves
to a Kennedy primary victory. Religion would be a sensitive issue
in West Virginia and the burden was placed on these workers to
ease the tension of Kennedy's Catholicism. One of the most

interesting aspects of tne campaign, which truley symbolized the
sensitivity of the religious factor, were the social pressures
levied against these local politicians for woking on the Kennedy
campaign. I examined a series of interviews furnished by the
John F. Kennedy Oral History Interview Program. Though not all
claimed discomfort in supporting Kennedy, these excerpts are
enlightening and do shed a light on the severity of the religious
factor in West Virginia.

Bob liyers directed the campaign effort in the local sub-
urbs outside of Charleston. He disclaims any personal antagonism por

levied against him but does discuss the brevity of religion in

his district:

Young: There have been reports from some

of the people who have been interviewed

in West Virginia that members of their fam-
ily because they were associated with the
Catholic candidate, felt social pressure.
Not exactly not being invited to the right
garden party, but things of that sort. Were
you or members of your family ever aware

of anything of this nature?

Myers: No, I never... I sometimes think
when you get involved in an emotional issue
of this type that... Again, maybe I'm being
too broadminded, but we never experienced
anything of this nature at all, not in the
slightest. Quite often, I think, individuals
might use something of this nature as an
