FRANCISCO TAPIA, age 7O; is a native of Bolivia
and a citizen of the United States. He lived at 691 East
Howard Street, Pasadena, until approximately eight months ago
when he exchanged his house with that of his son who needed
larger quarters. He is retired and devotes himself to Bible
study and religious activity.

Mr. TAPIA met and talked with SIRHAN SIRHAN several
times during the time he lived opposite the SIRHAN family.
He found them to be a decent family and he particularly
liked the mother who seemed to be a very fine, hard working
woman who was very interested in the welfare of her family.
On one occasion (he does not remember the time) he was inter-
viewed by the Pasadena Police Department regarding MUNIR
SIRHAN who had become involved with the police on a narcotics
matter. Mr. TAPIA said he told the investigating officers
that he knew of no derogatory information concerning MUNIR
or amy members of the SIRHAN family

With regard to SIRHAN SIRHAN, Mr. TAPIA said his
relationship was casual and pleasant, He spoke to him only as
SIRHAN would leave the house or return and SIRHAN seemed totdlly
absorbed in horses and becoming a jockey.

Mr. TAPIA said he had one serious conversation with
SIRHAN, and it had to do with religion and ones obligation to
God. At this time, SIRHAN claimed that he under
stood the difference between good and evil acts,: but felt thatsthere
were large areas in between which were so called indifferent
acts and he, SIRHAN, thought that many of these acts were good
or bad depending on the end results, For example,he said SIRHAN
brought up the matter of wealth and poverty . He said he felt
it was not wrong to take from the rich (i.e. steal) if one in-
tended to benefit the poor. TAPIA countered this by saying"no
it is good and necessary perhaps for the rich to give of their
surplus to the poor, but the poor were not entitled to steal ©
on this basis. SIRHAN said he did not feel this way.. .

Mr. TAPIA said he never discussed Judaism with
SIRHAN because he knew he was anti-Jevish. The whole SIRHAN
family was embittered over the results of the Arab-Israeli
War,

Mr. TAPIA said that pased on his observations, he never
would have guessed that SIRHAN harbored 'murderas thoughts and
intentions. He felt that SIRHAN was confused in his moral
understanding and probably more than a little influenced by
communist philoscphy.

Mr. TAPIA said he was not aware that SIRHAN SIRHAN
had listed him as a personal reference with the Pasadena ‘
Public Library; but this was entirely possible. Mr. TAPIA
said he was astonished to learn that SIRHAN had shot and
cilled Senator ROBERT KENNEDY and he had no explanation for
SIRHAN's motives.

STEVE STUART, 12025 East Broadway, Whittier, Cali-
fornia, was reinterviewed and advised as follows concerning
an individual with whom he shot pool at the Golden Garter Bar,
Alhambra, California, on one occasion in May, 1968:

When he observed a picture of SIRHAN SIRHAN on a
news telecast shortly after Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY was shot,
he thought SIRHAN resembled someone he had seen. On the same
day» shortly after he observed the telecast, one of the
MARTIGANI brothers (he is unable to recall which brother)
phoned him to tell him that SIRHAN had been in their bar, the
Golden Garter.

STUART later observed a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN
in a newspaper. At that time, which was after one of the
MARTIGANI brothers called him, he believed that SIRHAN SIRHAW
may have been the individual with whom he shot pool at the
Golden Garter Bar. After thiniing about this matter and the
statement made by the MARTIGANI brother that SIRHAN SIRHAN
had been in the bar, STUART says that the individual with whom
he shot pool resembled SIRHAN SIRHAN in appearance. He said he
only saw that individual in the bar once. At that time the
man was alone and during the game of pool they had very
little conversation.

STUART stated he normally frequented the bar after
6:00 pem. After observing a photograph of ROBERT ANDRESE,
he said he could not recall having seen ANDRESE in the Golden
Garter Bar or at another location.

He said in his opinion this matter concerning the
possibility that SIRHAN SIRHAN had been in the Golden Garter
Bar was "created by the MARTIGANI brothers who desire attention;”
also that the "MARTIGANI brothers are pathological liars.”

STUART said he had no factual information concerning
SIRHAN SIRHAN or any associates at the Golden Garter Bar.
