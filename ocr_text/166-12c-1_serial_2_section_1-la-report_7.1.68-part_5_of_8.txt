JESUS PEREZ, who resides at 1415 South
Burlington Avenue, Los Angeles, and who works as a
kitchen helper at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles,
was interviewed in the Spanish language by SA E. RHEAD
RICHARDS, JR. Due to the fact that PEREZ is unable to
read well in either English or Spanish, and what little
reading he can do must be done with the aid of a magniffing
glass because of poor vision, no signed statement was taken
from him. He furnished the following information:

PEREZ stated that he was born on April 7, 1923,
at Los Angeles, California, and that his parents were
Mexican citizens living in the United States. He stated that
at an early age his family returned to Mexico and he was
raised in Mexico City. PEREZ advised that he has worked at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles since the year 1955, and that
he is presently working the 4:00 p.m. to midnight shift
working in the kitchen.

PEREZ advised that he was working this shift
on the date of June 4, 1968, and that shortly before
midnight, or approximately 11:30 p.m., June 4, 1968,
he and several other kitchen employees were standing in
the pantry watching the happenings connected with the
victory speech of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY. PEREZ stated
that approximately one half hour before midnight, the
man who was later identified to him as SIRHAN SIRHAN, was also
in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel and appeared to
be just another curious onlooker waiting to get a glimpse
of the celebrities.

He stated that SIRHAN asked him and the other
kitchen employees three or four times if they were sure
that Senator KENNEDY would pass that way as he left the
Embassy Ballroom. PEREZ advised that he simply told SIRHAN
that he did not know.

PEREZ stated that SIRHAN was just standing
around waiting as-was-everyone else, but that he did notice
that he, SIRHAN, had some type of papers in his hands
and that he was folding them or twisting them in some way,
which gave the impression that he was nervous.

PEREZ advised that about 15 or 20 minutes
after midnight, or approximately 12:15 a.m., June 5, 1968,
Senator KENNEDY and his party left the Embassy Ballroom
and entered the pantry where he and the others were standing,
He stated that all of the people in the pantry, including
himself and his fellow workers, pressed forward to greet
the Senator and attempted to shake his hands and meet him.
PEREZ stated that he was shaking the Senator's hand, or
rather the Senator was just letting go of his hand after
having greeted him, when he heard a noise which sounded
to him like a gun shot or a fire cracker. He stated
that he turned his heac and saw the man later identified
as SIRHAN SIRHAN, waving his arm with an object in his
hand, which PEREZ recognized as a revolver. He stated he
saw the individual with the gun fire several more shots just
as several men grabbed him in an attempt to subdue him
and take away the pistol, PEREZ stated that his first though
was that the man was simply making noise and waving his
arm to get people out of the Senator's way, but that he
quickly realized that he was actually firing the gun. He sta
that after seeing the man partially subdued by others, he tur
to look back at Senator KENNEDY and saw that both the Senator
and one other individual had fallen to the floor.

PEREZ advised that at this point many people
crowded around KENNEDY and that he, PEREZ, backed up
slightly into the crowd to make room for those who would
have to care for the wounded. He stated that everyone was
yelling and milling about and calling for the police and an
ambulance, and that in a few minutes the ambulance came and
the {Senator was taken out.

PEREZ recalled at this point that when he had
seen SIRHAN prior to the shooting in the pantry, he appeared
to be alone and that at no time did he, PEREZ, see anyone
else who appeared to know or be accompanying SIRHAN. PEREZ
stated that while SIRHAN was shooting the last several shots
he appeared to be saying something, but that he, PEREZ, could
not make out what SIRHAN said because of the noise of the crowd,
He further stated that after having seen SIRHAN subdued by
other men, he did not see him again.

PEREZ stated that he had no idea how many people
had actually been in the pantry andhall during the shooting
inasmuch as everyone, including the press and the onlookers,
had been coming and going during the entire evening.

PEREZ advised that shortly after the ambulance
had taken Senator KENNEDY away, a detective from the Los
Angeles Police Department took him to the Rampart Division
Office in Los Angeles where he was interviewed and then
taken to the hotel from where he proceeded to his home.

PEREZ advised that he had appeared before the
Los Angeles County Grand Jury and that he had identified
a photograph of SIRHAN SIRHAN as being the same individual
that he saw shooting the gun in the pantry at the Ambassador
Hotel. He stated that should he recall any further information
that he feels would becfinterest to the FBI, he would
immediately contact the Los Angeles Office.
