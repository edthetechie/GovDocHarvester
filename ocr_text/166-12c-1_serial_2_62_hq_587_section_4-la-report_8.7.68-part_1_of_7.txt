which time he graduated. . .

* MICHAEL SLOMICH stated that he is aware that there
is a syrian~ Lebanese Cultural Center,. possibly known as‘ the
-~..Syrian-Lebanese-American. Cultural Center, located on Hollywood

Boulevard near Sunset Strip. He stated that this group is ~

a far right group, and he has knovwkgdge that in the past the

organization has permitted the American Nazi Party to

be significant in that SIRHAN was from Pasadena. .
Further interview with MICHAEL SLOMICH elicited.
from him the fact that he attended DuBois Club meetings at
the University of California at Los Angeles from approximately
February, 1966, to December,.1967. He stated that he was :
very friendly with one WALTER CROWE, who was one of the
significant individuals in this group. SLOMICH requested
that in the event CROWE were contacted for any reason that
his (SLOMICH! s) identity be completely concealed. SLOMICH
stated that in his association with the DuBois Club, which’
also included three city-wide meetings and twelve city-wide
parties, he had never observed SIRHAN at any of these affairs.
He indicated that he considered the DuBoig Club to: be a
conservative-type organization composed of middle-class
students who were rebelling against their parents. It was a
non-militant, nonactive group interested principally in
theory. He advised that the DuBois Club at Pasadena City
College was never active to any extent.

In addition, MICHAEL SLOMICH stated that he was in
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at the University
of California at Los Angeles from February, 1966, to December,
1967, and attended many meetings of this organization. He
expressed the opinion that he knew everyone in the SDS in
Southern California, including students from University of
California at Los Angeles, Pasadena City College, Los Angeles
City College and University of Southern California. He stated
that he does not recall SIRHAN as ever being in attendance
at any of these meetings, nor was he known to him in any
way through these activities.

SLOMICH advised that he is presently active in the
SDS at San Francisco State College and has been one of the
activists protesting the Naval ROTC unit on the campus, and —
that he has been involved in the current demonstrations at
this school.

MYRTLE CLAYTON, San Francisco, Police Department
Switchboard Operator, advised that at approximately 8:20
p.m. on June 6, 1968 she received a call from an unknown
male who advised he was calling from Muncie, Indiana. The
caller asked if the assassin of KENNEDY was being held in
San Francisco and she told him that he was not. The caller
then stated "It's a good thing he isn't and in fact whoever
has him should guard him closely as I intend to kill him.".
The operator transferred the call to one of the police .
department inspectors and he talked to the. man for only a
few seconds before he hung up. Apparently he made this same
threat to the police department inspector. An attempt was
made by the police department to trace the call through the
Muncie, Indiana operator which was unsuccessful since the
caller had hung up. It was determined through the operator’
that when the man placed the call he had given a non~existent
telephone number as’ the number he was calling from.

national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national

RODERICK LYNN MAC KAY was interviewed at 2527 Third
Street, Santa Monica, California. MAC KAY stated he is a self-
employed salesman, born at Quebec, Canada, and
has resided in Santa Monica, California, for the past four
years.

In May, 1967, he became irate at an attorney, J. B.
TIETZ, since TIETZ was assisting draft dodgers in the Los Angeles
area. He said he has tyvo sons in the military service and does
not condone this type of activity. He issued a complaint to the
American Bar Association concerning TIETZ; however, when they
did not appear to take any action, he decided to conduct his own
investigation in an effort to obtain evidence against TIETZ.

In connection with this, he has attended numerous
anti-draft and peace movement meetings in the Los Angeles
area. His primary source of information concerning these
clubs and meetings was obtained through a coffee shop formerly
located at Venice Boulevard and Ocean Highway in Venice,
California, and a meeting place for the #. E. B. Du Bois
Club.

He remained anonymous at these meetings to the extent
that he never furnished his full name and used the name
LYNN or MACK He did not take an active part in any of these
meetings, but merely listened and mingled with those attending.

MAC KAY stated shortly after January, 1968, he
discontinued attending these meetings since this endeavor was
costing considerable time and money and he did not feel he
was obtaining sufficient results to execute the disbarment
of TIETZ.

He said, however, when reading the account of the
assassination of ROBERT F. KENNEDY, he observed the address
of SIRHAN SIRHAN at 696 East Howard Street, Pasadena,
California, and felt this address was familiar to him. He
stated, however, he viewed photographs of SIRHAN SIRHAN in the
newspaper and did not connect either the name or the individual

with this address. He said to his knowledge, he has never
seen SIRHAN SIRHAN or heard his name prior to June 5, 1968.

As a result, he began reviewing various documents
and notes he had obtained from attending anti-draft meetings
and on five separate documents, spotted the Howard Street
address. ,

He said he could not recall the significance of
the addresses on Howard Street, except that it must have
been furnished to him as an address for draft counseling

MAC KAY continued that the address of 6963 East
Howard Street, Pasadena, California, appears with the name
JOANN on a Peace Exchange Calendar for May, 1967. He said
this is a pencil notation written on the side of the calendar
opposite a notice for a meeting on May 10, 1967, at the
Workmen's Circle Cult Center, 1619 South Robertson Boulevard,
West Los Angeles, California. The caption of this meeting
was entitled, "A Progressive Israeli's Interpretation of
Problems in the Middle East’. Avri Fischer of Kibbutz KFAR
Masryk, Israel.

MAC KAY said he attended this meeting and as best
he can recall, this address would have been furnished to him
by JOANN (last name unknown), who was also in attendance at
the meeting. He recalls JOANN being present at numerous
meetings he attended and especially at W. E. B. Du Bois
Club functions.

He described JOANN as a Caucasian, female, 2/4 to
25 years of age, five feet six inches in height, dark hair,
and below average intelligence. He commented that most
of the individuals attending these meetings were college
students; however, he did not feel JOANN was a college student.

MAC KAY said the address of 696 East Howard Street,
city not listed, also appeared on two Draft Counselors lists
which had been obtained through attending anti-draft meetings.
He said again the address is merely penciled in on the side
of a typewritten list and he could not recall the reason for

- 915 =>

LA 56-156

the address, except that it must have been in response to
telephone soliciting which he made. He clarified this by
saying, upon obtaining a Draft Counselors list,he would make
pretext telephone calls to individuals on the list and én
many occasions was referred to a specific address for

draft counseling. He said the address of 696 East Howard
Street must have been given to him for this purpose.

MAC KAY also discovered the address of 696 East
Howard, Pasadena, on a slip of notepaper and next to the
address was the name JOE HANDY. Again, he could not recall
the significance of this address or any connection with the
name JOE HANDY and the address. He said he did not know
anyone by the name of JOE HANDY and could only surmise that
it might have been a code name to be used at 696 Howard Street
for obtaining draft counseling.

He also discovered a Security First National Bank
Check Order Blank concerning WALTER W. and MARIE K. KOENIG,
3201 East Barhite Street, Pasadena, California, which
contains the handwritten name and address of MARIE K. KOENIG
on the back of the order blank and under her address is the
address 688-696 East Howard Street, and the name JOE HANDY.
As he recalls, he must have obtained this address from
MARIE KOENIG at an anti-draft meeting; however, he could not
recall anything additional concerning MARIE KOENIG.

MAC KAY said he furnished the original of all
documents, containing any addresses relating to the
Howard Street address, to the Intelligence Division of
the Los Angeles Police Department, hovrever, he was continuing
to go through all his records to determine if there are any
other references to the address.

The following description of MAC KAY was obtained
through observation and interview.
