Prosecution and defense at-

The trial had been scheduled

was to permit a new member

with the case. He just wound up

December 10, 1968

Mr. President
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington, D.C.

My Dear Mr. President:

I wish to express my opinion on something which
has concerned me greatly for months. It is, the
assasination of Senator Robert Kennedy. “I wonder
Mr. President why this Mr. Sirhan Sirhan is allowed a
life to live when he has taken without reason or cause
the life of a most beloved American. Surely, Mr. President
I realize that there are problems enough today in the
world which require more priority, but Mr. President
can't something be done to avenge this wrong doing by
Mr. Sirhan?

Mr. President, I do love my country just as it is,
as free as it is, but should Mr. Sirhan be allowed to
share my American freedom?

I must tell you I am a 22 year old young woman
with a strong feeling and have no doubt that this
same feeling concerning Senator Kennedy's assasination
is shared by millions of other American people.

Thank you very much Mr. President for taking the
time to read this.

Very respectfully yours,

1 ; it ‘
ty ; Esther M. Priore

Dear Sir:
Enclosed is a copy of letter I recently received from
a constituent regarding efforts that are apparently being

made to establish that Sirhan Sirhan was insane at the
time of the assination.

It would be most appreciated if you would review her
letter and inform me of your position in this regard.

“HONORABLE ROBERT MATHIAS

November 26, 1968

LONGWORTH HOUSE OFFICE BLDG.
ROOM 1008
WASHINGTON, D. C.

Honorable Sir:

I have a question to ask and would appreciate receiving a direct
response from you.

I read in the Bakersfield Califosuia, 11/25/68, that Sirhan Sirhan

is to be given "chromosome" sanity tests to determine if he has a
possivle hereditary compuisiou toward violence. If he has a
"chromosome" count of XYY in Llicu of XY he might be considered a
"super male" who is predisposed toward violence. My question is,

why are they trying so hard to prove this man insane so that he will
not be executed for the death of ove, Robert F. Kennedy? Instead, pvt
him in a mental institutioa fcr 5 to 10 years then be released as a
free man. Who is behind ali this political idiocy and how much money
is involved???

Why wasn’t a "chromosome" tese Given to the killerssand rapers of
Timothy Luce and Susan Bartnemei? Que of the accused has been given
the death penalty which £ believe is ouly right and just. Was such
a test given to one Richard Welch for the killing and rapyiag of the
Jenkins boy and Déane Bredfurd? What about Richard Speck and the 8
nurses? How many other aurdevcis aud rapists ete. dowa through the
years have been given the advaaiage oi a "chromosome test"?

Who and why are they trying so hard to feee this man of such a senseless
slaying? Why can't he be give a teial tike any other human being wuc
has committed a crime? Iu it because this is the game of politics?
Because he has one Russcll Parsous deiveuding him? Because it was a
political figure killed - a Kenedy? Wasn't Bobby Kennedy just anothex
ordinary human being with an ovdinary dally job? I believe in freedom
and justice for all wea, bee why is jusitca toyed with so wuch?

I realize that their is move noacy involved as far as the attorney repeo-
scntating Sirhan is involved Luc wey dues money always have to win out «
way can't things be excepicd for what they are.

but T won't. Again I woutd

~ ceuld go on and on rege

It is tragic, of course, that many children
have unhappy homes and consequently develop
resentful and distorted adult dis positions.

However, the fact remains that anyone who
commits a murder is TEMPQRARILY INSANE.
In other words, has lost control of his
emotions.

No matter what his background, is dangerous
to the lew abiding citizens. Yet that defense
and others like it, turn these people loose
to endanger other lives and property, every
Single day.

There should be a law enacted immediately, to
void the possibility of using the 'TEMPORARILY
INSANE! and similar defense argument; to acquit
these people who commit crimes because they

cannot control their emotions. Even those who

are convicted are too, too often released from
prison after serving a few years of their sentence.

THE TIME IS LONG PAST DUE WHEN FIRST PRIORITY IS

GIVEN TO PROTECTING THE CRIMINAL, AND SECOND

PLACE GIVEN TO THE LAW ABIDING. it should be changed.

Dear Mr. President;

I am sure you have seen and heard about this Sirhan case
that up until today our government has spect 285,949.00 in trying to find
this guilty.

Just what kind of laws did our forefathers lay down for us
Was it for justice,or was it for someone to tamper with and interpret it
as they saw fit. ??

Egveryone you talk to ,they wonder in amazement about how
much money the government spends to try to prove someone innocent whether it
be by the fact of hiding behind the 5th amendment of trying to prove the
man insane, Aren't we all insane to a certain degree then. ????

Our Jaws and our courts are getting to be a big farcee
You have a man who was caught red handed and had killed and tortured 8:
young nurses, This man is still in the best hospitals and under the best of
care, while our boys fighting in Viet Nam are prisoners and being deprived
of so many necessities of life, Yet here we have a brutal criminal who did
confess, who was not sorry for what he did and yet our coutry thru its mal
interpreted laws, are fighting so hard to save this mans life at the expense
of all of us, Does this make right thinking ???

Now here you have Sirhan who was caught , he did it he ad
mitted the T.V. cameras can tell you he did it, and yet our laws are fighting
so hard to try to prove this jerk insane. Does this make sense Where is
our law and order and our fair justice in our courts ???? You will take an
honest citizen who has never committed a crime, but make a mistake on his
income tax return,, a federal case is made if this, The newspapers will smear
his name all over the front page the radio adds all the momentum,until this
honest man is shamed and all he can do is committ suicide.And yet a murderes
who is caught red handed is permitted to go free and engoy_ the tremedous care
given to these privileged prisoners. Just what is this ??? Who'festore some
sanity to our courts and to our senseless courts and judges and crooked
lawyers who get big fat fees to liberate a known criminal, This is a laughing
stock, Other nations have a right to critiekse our way of taxing our people
so that we may protect criminal and murderers, You can't blame people for not
wanting to pay taxes when they are nspent wisely and judicinisty.

As the president you do have some powers to suggest some
corrections, ask some senator to sponsor legislation which could plug up
these wasteful loopholes.Put to death anyone who is found guilty of trying to
overthrow our governement ,selling our secrets to the enemy, and mpaderers who
rape, steal, and topture, Do hope you will get some legistation to stop this
wanting lawlessness and pepensite upkeep pf criminals.

/ ~ fs . Yours Sincerely

Dear Sir(han):

Having removed an all but unsurmounta=
ble obstacle from the path of the Republican presi~
dential candidate you have not only earned the grat-
itude of conservative Americans but become the un~
disputed kingmaker in this year’s presidential con-
test. Your service to the cause of anti~communisn
has been of uncalculable magnitude and will not soon
be forgotten by the military planners who have worked
so hard to escalate a minor civil war in Asia into
an ideological confrontation of major proportions,

The skillful elimination of Senator
Rebert F, Kennedy from the political scene and the
prevention of an impending Kennedy landslide were
executed in the aggressive spirit of your great com
patriot Amin El-Husaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalen,
who as early as 1942 recognized the extent of the
communist menace. This noted Arab nationalist sup-
ported Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union un-
equivocally and it can be assumed that many of his
Arab followers and other right-wing extremists look
upon the war in Vietnam as being a continuation of
this original anti-communist crusade.

Your bold action has altered the course
of history. The world trembles in contemplation of
the ominous consequences of your morbid deed.....
